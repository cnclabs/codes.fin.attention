item business 
overview active power designs  manufactures and markets power quality products that provide consistent  reliable and cost effective ride through  or temporary  power for the majority of power disturbances  such as voltage sags and surges  and bridge the gap between a power outage and restoration of power or the time required to switch to generator power 
our products are designed to be environmentally friendly compared to existing solutions without compromising functionality  efficiency or cost 
we have shipped over  flywheels  or more than megawatts of our products  representing million in revenue  to business locations in over countries around the world since our founding in we are headquartered in austin  texas 
our patented flywheel energy storage systems store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods until utility power is fully restored or a backup electric generator starts and takes over generating longer term backup power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we believe that our flywheel products provide many competitive advantages over traditional battery based systems  including substantial space savings  high power densities  green energy storage and power efficiencies as high as that reduce total operational energy costs 
we offer our flywheel products with load capabilities from kva to kva  while typically targeting higher power density applications above kva since the majority of these customers already have back up generators 
we market our flywheel products under the brand name cleansource 
cleansource dc is a non chemical replacement for lead acid batteries used for bridging power 
utilizing our flywheel energy storage technology  the cleansource dc is a stand alone direct current dc product that is compatible with all major brands of uninterruptible power supplies ups 
we built on the technological success of cleansource dc by creating a battery free ups  cleansource ups  which integrates the ups electronics and our flywheel energy storage system into one compact cabinet 
cleansource ups represents the majority of our current revenues 
combining our cleansource ups with a generator provides customers with complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance 
we sell our cleansource flywheel products to commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets including manufacturing  technology  communications  utilities  healthcare  banking and military and in all major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america and europe 
to address the longer runtime requirements of customers without backup generators that still need protection from utility disturbances  we also have developed a patented extended runtime product that we call coolair dc 
we initially have targeted coolair dc at lower power levels than our flywheel products  and it is sold as a minute for minute replacement for lead acid batteries 
coolair dc can provide backup power for several minutes to hours depending on the customer application 
coolair dc utilizes mature thermal and compressed air storage tacas technologies combined in a proprietary manner to produce backup power during an electrical disturbance 
this product discharges cool air as a by product of its operation that also can be used by customers during an electrical disturbance as a source of backup cooling 
in addition to offering a dc only solution  when customers desire a complete backup solution with an extended runtime  we have introduced the coolair ups that couples our coolair dc product with a third party double conversion ups 
coolair initially is being targeted at small to medium size data center customers in north america following its commercial introduction in the us in the second quarter of and the international version in the fourth quarter of market opportunities according to a frost sullivan report  the overall annual worldwide ups market exceeds billion in sales  with an average annual growth rate of projected through the ups market consists of 
table of contents single phase and three phase segments based on user power level requirements 
the three phase segment is typically used by commercial and industrial customers  and the single phase segment is typically used by residential and other lower power level applications 
active power targets the three phase ups market  covering kva and higher power applications  that was estimated to make up approximately of this market in  or approximately billion per year 
the segment of the market above kva that we target with our flywheel products was estimated by frost sullivan to be approximately million per year in  and is projected to grow at a annual rate through the market between kva  which is where we target our coolair products  was estimated to be approximately billion per year in and is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately through we believe that the following trends in power use will create additional market opportunities for us with our current product portfolio increasing awareness of need for backup power systems 
increases in the size and frequency of natural disasters  utility grid failures  and a general increase in power demand have increased the number of businesses that are exposed to the risks associated with  and the negative effects of  power quality interruptions 
the transfer of manufacturing and enterprise services to developing countries with poor quality infrastructure also is increasing the visibility of the economic effects of poor power quality 
further  many developing economies lack adequate power infrastructure to ensure continuous power for industry  which impacts productivity and efficiency 
collectively  this increased awareness of the risks of business interruption due to power quality or supply interruption is driving more businesses to consider the need for more reliable backup power systems 
trend toward higher power installations 
new computing capabilities and developments in higher performance microprocessor designs are increasing power requirements for many industries 
often these higher power requirements are mirrored with shrinking space availability  requiring a power quality solution with greater power density that frees up space for more revenue generating computing applications 
alternatively  customers may desire to retrofit their existing facilities to handle more power since the cost of constructing new facility space continues to rise 
high power installations are not limited to a particular vertical market or industry  but  by way of example  can include semiconductor plants  large hospital or medical complexes  large industrial manufacturing plants  broadcast communications facilities  transportation facilities airports  etc  and large computer data centers 
furthermore  in high power installations  customers are more likely to be comfortable with our products because they already are familiar with battery free alternative technologies such as flywheels and rotary ups systems  and are more likely to be using a backup power generator for their applications 
extended runtime applications 
in certain applications  where extended bridging power may be required  users are looking to increase the amount of backup time that their power quality solutions can provide 
the longer the backup time  the greater the ability to operate through a complete power disturbance or to conduct an orderly shut down of operations that can minimize the economic impact of a utility power interruption 
a large portion of the kva ups market  particularly in north america  currently operates without backup generator systems and have tended to rely only on battery based ups systems 
these customers typically need five to fifteen minutes of runtime from their energy storage system  which today is primarily being served by battery based technology 
the backup power systems for many of these customers do not provide power to their cooling systems during a utility disturbance 
this only increases the likelihood of a thermal overload of their computing systems increasing the risk of a disturbance to the customer s mission critical applications 
as a result  a computing facility may overheat despite the availability of sufficient backup power for computer systems during a utility disturbance 
the ability to solve cooling problems during a utility power disturbance  and the ability to extend the available runtime while eliminating the need for a costly generator or hvac backup system is critical to meeting the backup power quality needs of the small and mid sized commercial markets 

table of contents our key strengths we believe that our key strengths and differentiators can be summarized as follows differentiated product offering that provides cost saving opportunities 
we believe our products offer higher reliability than competing battery alternatives and are more easily maintained 
we offer products with an estimated year design life  compared to battery solutions that have average lifespans of as little as years 
given their durable construction  and lack of heat sensitive electrochemicals  our products can work in harsh environments with high reliability and without the operating costs associated with heating or cooling that may otherwise be required by a backup power system 
our flywheel products can provide up to times more power in the same space as an alternative battery based system 
this increased power density allows us to free up valuable revenue generating space for customers  or to allow them to provide higher backup power levels in their current space without the need for additional build out 
our flywheel products operate with up to power efficiency that  given the long product lifetime  can translate into significant cost savings over the product s lifecycle 
we estimate  when considering the need for ongoing maintenance  replacement costs and the physical environmental requirements of battery based products  that the total cost of ownership of our flywheel based products  which includes purchase price  installation  maintenance and energy costs accumulated over a year period  is less than half of that of comparable battery based system 
our megawatt class ups platform allows us to compete for large system installations where there are fewer competitors and where battery based solutions are less favorable due to greater space requirements and higher maintenance costs 
we also broadened our product range into the extended runtime category with the introduction of coolair  a product platform that provides a minute for minute alternative to the backup power of batteries while also providing backup cooling during a power outage 
we began production of our coolair product platform in the second quarter of significant near term growth opportunities in large commercial markets 
with the increasing importance of consistent and reliable electric power  we are experiencing significant interest in our products and expect this to result in near term and sustained growth opportunities 
the build out of large data centers in north america and europe and the relative unreliability of utility provided electricity have resulted in a global increase in investment in backup power systems in a wide range of industries  including healthcare  broadcast and communications  transportation and manufacturing 
we currently are focused on serving the american and european markets 
these markets represent approximately of the global billion ups market according to a frost sullivan study and approximately of the kva market where we primarily compete with our flywheel based products 
we plan to expand into other geographies beginning in  including markets located in asia and latin america  where we believe that these same global power demand trends will offer us significant near and long term growth opportunities 
well respected and established distribution partners 
we maintain strategic alliances with several of the leading power technology distribution partners in the united states  including caterpillar  eaton electrical and general electric  each of which has endorsed our products 
these alliances provide us with sales distribution channels into commercialized global markets 
for example  caterpillar distributes our flywheel ups system under the caterpillar brand name through their global dealer network 
we have a partnership with ge that gives ge the non exclusive right to purchase and sell our cleansource dc products  and eaton electrical also provides us with sales and services support for the cleansource dc products 
we have added other regional distributors for our cleansource dc products  including fuji electric in japan and vega power asea e t in the republic of korea 
one of few economically viable  environmentally friendly and safe solutions 
with the low operating costs less than half the total costs of battery based solutions over a year period and year design life span of our products  we believe we offer one of only a few economically viable  environmentally friendly and safe products available on the market today 
given heightened social awareness and increased environmental concerns  we believe our products are well positioned to capitalize on this trend 
we believe that we are particularly well positioned for the european market  which is characterized by higher energy costs  more significant economic incentives to use green power and a greater environmental awareness 
our products do not have the safety  
table of contents toxicity and environmental concerns of battery based solutions and they are not subject to the same physical operating requirements and can perform in harsh climates and extreme conditions far better than battery based products 
poorly maintained battery installations can present fire and safety risks up to and including fires and explosion  and we have successfully sold our products to many customers due to their problems with batteries high cost  high maintenance  disposal issues  low reliability and their need for a safer and environmentally friendly alternative 
our business strategy active power s primary operating goal is to provide innovative three phase power quality solutions to enable businesses to continue to operate in the event of electrical power disturbances 
key elements of our strategy include migrate to a systems solution provider from current product focus 
we believe that our approach of focusing on a solutions based offering  including service  will accelerate our growth potential and path to operating profitability 
our history of product development has resulted in new and innovative products for solving power quality and reliability issues  including our cleansource flywheel based products and our coolair tacas based products 
over the last five years we have improved and broadened our range of three phase power quality products and introduced new technologies to meet user requirements at higher and lower power levels 
during this period  we primarily have employed a narrow sales channel strategy to sell our products  which resulted in our functioning largely as a product supplier to our original equipment manufacturer oem partners and direct customers 
however  our experience in the market has led us to conclude that many customers prefer to be provided with a complete power quality solution  including our products and ancillary products that are needed to complete the system solution such as switching gear and generators  design and installation services  as well as regular product maintenance and repair services 
we believe that changing our sales focus to one of solutions based rather than product focused offerings will allow us to increase revenue opportunities  increase direct end user contact to facilitate continuing product development  create opportunities for repeat business  and enhance our ability to sell higher margin service and repair business to our customers 
broaden our available markets and channels of distribution 
historically  the majority of our sales were made through our oem channels 
as recently as  of our revenues were made via our oem channels  with the majority of this revenue coming from caterpillar 
since then we have focused on establishing a direct sales channel that supplements our oem channel while enabling us to expand into new geographies 
we began this strategy by adding direct sales employees with power industry sales experience in western europe and in parts of the caribbean and mexico 
by adding more direct and solution focused sales personnel  we have increased the proportion of direct sales from of revenue in to of revenues in as we increase sales in a region  we add service personnel and project management skills to manage customer implementations and provide post sales support 
we also are adding new sales offices  complete with demonstration and service capabilities  to complement our sales activities and to create a more local presence for our international customers 
while the oem channel has provided brand credibility to our company and our products  particularly in new markets and with larger customers such as our multi megawatt project customers  the oem channel has not been effective in markets where  for example  the oem did not have a significant existing power quality business in that market 
in such situations we have elected to broaden our sales channels and have started selling products directly with active power personnel and through third party representatives such as manufacturers representatives and value added resellers vars 
we will continue to evaluate our oem  var partners and manufacturers representatives in each market to ensure adequate performance and growth  and to enhance the sales potential of each of our geographic regions 
we also will continue to manage potential channel conflicts within markets  and continue to support the requirements of our partners to enable our success with this multi channel global sales strategy 

table of contents in and we added approximately manufacturers representatives primarily focused in north america 
we also began to add more direct sales employees and sales agents to broaden our reach 
as we have expanded our direct selling capabilities  we also have expanded into new international markets and hired additional direct sales resources  particularly in europe  the middle east and africa emea during and as we complete the broadening of our sales channels in the americas and emea  we plan to expand our sales capabilities into other regions  principally latin america and asia beginning in these regions fit the profile of areas where our products have been most successful to date areas with poor power infrastructure and with growing economies 
we anticipate that this expansion will increase the available market for our products and provide opportunities for further growth 
expand our customer service capabilities 
we intend to expand our customer service capabilities so that we can develop direct customer relationships  increase revenue and margins through increased service offerings  and receive more direct feedback from customers 
we are increasing the size and geographical coverage of our service organization to mirror our expanding direct sales force and to enhance the direct service capabilities we provide to our end user customers 
historically  our oem partners managed end user customers and captured the service revenues 
we will place additional emphasis on developing new and innovative service solutions to augment our current offerings and to provide enhanced value for the customer 
service operations have been highly profitable segments for established power quality companies  and we believe that our expanded service organization will play a key role in generating new sales prospects  increasing revenues and providing us with more future sales opportunities as a result of direct client contact 
leverage our core technologies to develop next generation products 
we intend to continue to use our expertise in power electronics and advanced electromechanical technologies  combined with an integrated solutions approach to developing new and enhanced products  to continue to create innovative  environmentally friendly solutions that lower the cost and to increase the quality of electric power 
we will continue to improve our designs for simplicity  service and cost 
we also will continue with judicious cost reductions and feature enhancements to increase customer value and ensure competitively priced and comprehensively serviced solutions 
in the last five years we have invested over million in research and development of new products  features and technologies associated with power quality 
we now have what we believe to be one of the broadest product offerings in the power quality market 
we intend to leverage customer feedback and market intelligence so that we can capitalize on our engineering investment in our product and technology platforms  and we plan to introduce new product categories  features and benefits that will help us maintain our position as a technology leader in power quality solutions 
increase our marketing focus to build the active power brand 
we intend to further support our sales channels by increasing our marketing focus and by building the active power brand 
in we added additional resources and changed our marketing focus to better leverage our multi channel sales strategy with a more structured marketing philosophy 
we believe a structured approach is necessary to create an integrated  scalable marketing plan that can support each channel  each product and each geography 
we believe that more and better sales tools  more lead generation and more brand awareness due to our increased investment and market focus will lead to greater sales success 

table of contents our flywheel business overview our flywheel energy storage system provides a highly reliable  low cost and non toxic replacement for lead acid batteries used in conventional power quality installations 
we have shipped over  flywheels  or more than megawatts of our products to business locations in over countries around the world 
the flywheel market the principle of using stored energy in the form of a flywheel to bridge the gap between a power failure and an emergency diesel generator has been well accepted in europe and around the world since the s 
in some mature markets  these type of products have the majority of the large capacity ups business 
these earlier diesel rotary ups products were limited by roller bearing technology and possessed no more than five seconds of stored energy  requiring special arrangements for the selection and starting of the diesel generator engine 
the mechanically in line nature of the system also limited the output power of these products 
in the s advances in design  including the use of permanent magnets to reduce the load on main bearings  increased the performance of flywheel designed products 
against this background  the active power designed products deploy far more advanced technology and can address a large market that is knowledgeable and familiar with flywheel products 
our flywheel products generally compete in the greater than kva ups market 
the size of this market was estimated in to be approximately million in annual sales in a frost sullivan market study  and is anticipated to grow by annually through traditionally this market has been served by battery based ups technologies  however  substitute products  such as flywheels  are now offering viable alternatives to conventional ups technology 
at the greater than kva power level  the primary market includes medium and large data centers  operator centers  telecommunications switching gear  broadcasting equipment and process control industrial equipment 
ups systems at this level require special support for installing  auditing and maintaining the system 
hence  more products at this level are sold via direct sales and manufacturers representatives 
in the reseller channel  mechanical and electrical contractors contribute significantly to the sales process and are an important advocate of a vendor s product who can design a ups manufacturer into a customer application 
most applications within this power category serve mission critical applications 
therefore  downtime or power interruption for these applications can lead to severe financial losses for customers 
this also makes this segment of the ups market somewhat less sensitive to price because products are more likely to be evaluated in terms of product reliability  performance and power quality 
due to the mission critical nature of the applications supported  customers are more likely to select established power quality brands and prefer a direct relationship with the supplier 
therefore  assurance of a well developed service organization is viewed as critically important 
today this market segment is dominated by a small number of global ups manufacturers  including liebert  american power conversion  mge and eaton 
these companies have strong brand recognition  global service capabilities and broad distribution channels 
smaller  local companies also compete in most major markets 
the biggest driver of growth for ups systems  particularly in this high power segment  is the increase in power requirements of network and data storage equipment 
this growth in power requirements is driving a change in backup power systems  and we believe the number of new installations and build outs also will have a major impact on ups growth 
as power consumption is increasing  customers are looking to more efficient ups designs that can save space  and that can operate with higher levels of efficiency to reduce electricity expenses 
conventional ups systems use lead acid battery based backup solutions 
while this technology is mature  there are known limitations  including the need to constantly monitor the level of availability  significant space requirements  susceptibility to high and low temperatures requiring that they be placed in temperature controlled 
table of contents rooms  toxicity and safety concerns  and significant annual operating and service costs 
alternative technologies that can offer higher reliability  lower total cost of operation and smaller  space efficient design  and that are safe and non toxic  should be able to capture market share in this market segment 
flywheel based products offer these advantages and have been in the market for a number of years to prove their reliability and efficiency 
flywheel products have been in the european market for several decades  and are more established as a viable battery alternative in that market generally 
we believe that success in that market will be mirrored in other regions of the world  especially as flywheel based products become more established 
our successful market penetration of the ups market primarily depends on two factors 
first  our ability to compete with existing double conversion  battery based ups systems 
second  the acceptance of our flywheel based ups in industrial applications where batteries are not an option due to the harsh operating environment 
our current flywheel products have a shorter runtime than the battery based systems typically seconds to seconds as compared to minutes to minutes with battery based solutions at a comparable installed cost 
however  our flywheel ups  when compared to equivalent lead acid battery based solutions  offers a significantly higher power density to times greater  lower lifecycle cost  lower maintenance requirements  higher power efficiency as compared with high to low percentages for comparable battery based double conversion ups systems  broader power range  and a higher operating temperature range 
these product features allow us to compete more effectively with battery based alternatives 
our flywheel technology our patented flywheel energy storage system stores kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel acting as a motor driven by utility power in a low friction environment 
when the user requires short term backup power ie  when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity  known as bridging power  for short periods until utility power is restored or a backup electric generator starts and takes over generating longer term backup power for extended electrical outages 
we believe that  relative to other energy storage alternatives  our system provides high quality  reliable power at an effective cost 
the primary benefits of our flywheel based systems include power density and power efficiency of up to 
on average  our flywheel based ups systems can produce twice as much power as comparable battery based systems and only require approximately one half of the equivalent space  or footprint  resulting in a fourfold improvement in power density 
power density for backup power equipment is defined as the amount of backup power a product can provide in a given area 
providing a greater power density allows increased power loads in customer data centers and frees up space for computing systems instead of backup power quality systems 
power efficiency is a measure of the amount of power consumed by the power quality or backup system when operating 
this consumed power is also called the standby loss 
the more power efficient a backup power system is  the less power it consumes 
our flywheel based products have lower standby losses less than than an equivalent battery based system  meaning that they have higher power efficiency 
as the customer s costs of electricity rise  we believe that the efficiency of our flywheel based systems offer greater energy savings resulting in lower total cost of ownership for the customer than battery based systems 
rather than rely on the flywheel concepts developed for other applications  we focused our development efforts on providing products that meet the specific needs of the three phase power quality market 
users requiring backup power products desire products that can deliver high quality  reliable power at a reasonable price 
as a result of these needs  we developed a flywheel system that operates at lower speeds under  rotations per minute than the original flywheel applications developed for space based missions  and with increased reliability 
these speeds are comparable to those of automobile engines and industrial machinery 
this lower flywheel speed has allowed us to achieve a lower cost design by using an inexpensive bearing system and conventional steel in place of expensive composite materials 

table of contents the design of our flywheel system  which is displayed below  integrates the function of a motor which utilizes electric current from the electric utility grid to provide the energy to rotate the flywheel  flywheel rotor which spins constantly to maintain a ready source of kinetic energy  and generator which converts the kinetic energy of the flywheel into electricity into a single system 
this integration further reduces the cost of our product and increases its efficiency 
logo the flywheel rotor is designed to spin in a near frictionless environment by the use of a low cost combination of a magnetic and mechanical bearing system 
the friction in the spinning chamber is further reduced by the creation of a partial vacuum  which reduces the amount of air in the chamber that otherwise creates drag on the flywheel rotor 
the flywheel rotor stores energy in the form of kinetic energy by constantly rotating within the vacuum container 
as the flywheel rotor slows down when a user requires power  the rotor s magnetism is increased as it rotates past copper coils contained in the armature to generate constant output power 
this enables the flywheel system to provide between seconds and seconds of electricity during power disturbances 
while a lead acid battery can typically provide backup power for a much longer period  this capability usually is not required when a customer also employs a backup generator 
our flywheel based system can provide ride through  or temporary  power for the majority of power disturbances  such as voltage sags and surges  and can bridge the gap between a power outage and the time required to switch to generator power 
we have verified our flywheel design with both internal and external three dimensional finite element analysis  as well as tests designed to determine the flywheel s safety at varying speeds 
we test each flywheel rotor with stringent quality control methods 
these tests have demonstrated a factor of safety consistent with common industrial machines such as large motors and generators 
our flywheel products cleansource dc cleansource dc is a non chemical replacement for lead acid batteries used for short term backup power in power quality installations 
utilizing our flywheel energy storage technology  cleansource dc is a stand alone direct current dc product that is compatible with all major brands of ups 
it is compact  quiet and has demonstrated field proven reliability 
when the ups electronics detect a power disturbance  cleansource dc draws on the power stored as kinetic energy in the flywheel to generate backup power 
cleansource dc can operate in conjunction with or can replace battery strings used in ups and continuous power systems  or cps 
it also can replace the batteries now used with fuel cells and micro turbines to meet peak power demands 
this system is available in a variety of delivered power ratings up to kw per flywheel system 
we also can configure the units in parallel to meet higher power requirements 
cleansource dc has been 
table of contents designed for much longer service intervals and more extreme operating environments than typical lead acid battery installations 
our longest continually running cleansource dc unit was installed in june our installed cleansource dc units have accumulated approximately million hours of field proven reliability through december  the cleansource dc comprised approximately  and of our total revenue during  and  respectively 
cleansource ups we built on the technological success of cleansource dc by creating a battery free ups  cleansource ups  which now represents the majority of our current revenues 
instead of a ups and string of batteries in two separate cabinets  we have integrated the ups electronics and our flywheel energy storage system into one compact cabinet 
our installed cleansource ups units have accumulated over million hours of field operation as of december  the cleansource ups product family comprised approximately  and of our total revenue during   respectively 
the cleansource ups design takes advantage of the many component similarities between cleansource dc and standard ups electronics 
each system requires power conversion electronics  fans for cooling  a frame for structural support  a user display with data reporting capability  and other overlapping functions 
by combining these functions into a single system  as shown in the diagram below  we can provide a highly reliable  cost efficient power quality solution 
cleansource ups system efficiencies logo due to its proprietary cost efficient design  cleansource ups can be competitively priced in relation to the installed cost of a conventional battery based ups 
due to its high operating efficiency  small footprint and long service life  we believe that the total cost of ownership of cleansource ups  which includes the purchase price  installation  maintenance and energy costs accumulated over a year period  is less than half of that of conventional battery based ups systems 
we designed cleansource ups to be compatible with new and installed standby generators  extending their application to use in a continuous power system  or cps 
we currently offer our cleansource ups product line in kva kva power ranges  and it can be configured in parallel up to kva 
our megawatt class cleansource ups platform uses a separate power electronics platform than the cleansource ups systems in the kva kva power ranges 
with its compact and efficient design  we believe that our megawatt class product gives us a significant competitive advantage in the high power ups market  which is currently served by only a few battery free companies 
we also have the ability to configure multiple megawatt class ups systems together in parallel up to kva  as evidenced by our having sold multiple kva ups 
the customers of high power ups systems demand that they be highly 
table of contents configurable 
we believe that the ability to link multiple of our megawatt class ups machines in parallel to support higher power levels will allow us to address the multi megawatt market for power quality equipment by offering our customers a large building block  thereby requiring fewer ups systems  to address their multi megawatt power quality needs 
we installed our first paralleled megawatt class ups system in flywheel customers prior to our primary customers were oems 
our most significant oem customer has been and continues to be caterpillar  which distributes cleansource ups under its own brand name  and was responsible for approximately of our revenue in since we have continued to make progress with our active power branded sales channel by selling cleansource ups and dc products directly and through manufacturers representatives throughout north america and in several other international regions 
this sales and distribution channel has increased our end user interaction and allowed us to respond to customer needs more quickly

of veterans affairs competition our cleansource dc product competes with makers of lead acid batteries and organizations developing battery free technologies for ups applications 
among the manufacturers of battery free products  piller  a european based company  currently offers a flywheel energy storage system that competes with the cleansource 
table of contents dc at comparable power levels 
however  the piller flywheel is only available with piller s proprietary ups system 
in addition  pentadyne  a us based private company  recently began to offer a dc flywheel energy storage system 
examples of other technologies potentially competitive with cleansource dc include high speed composite flywheels  ultra capacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage 
to date  however  we believe that none of these technologies has achieved a sufficient presence in our market to be considered a direct competitor 
the cleansource ups competes primarily with battery based ups manufacturers such as eaton electrical  liebert and mge ups systems 
in addition  the cleansource ups competes with battery free systems from piller  hitec and ks techniques previously eurodiesel 
with the megawatt class cleansource ups  we are competing with the same group of competitors mentioned above 
however  we believe this megawatt class ups market currently comprises the largest percentage of battery free ups systems in the ups market 
we believe the broader market acceptance of battery free technologies in this power range should strengthen our competitive position 
our coolair business coolair overview coolair dc provides backup power for several minutes to hours depending on the customer application 
coolair dc utilizes mature thermal and compressed air storage tacas technologies combined in a proprietary manner to produce backup power and backup cooling during an electrical disturbance 
coolair dc is initially targeted at lower power levels than our flywheel products  and is sold as a minute for minute replacement for lead acid batteries 
in addition to offering a dc only solution  when customers desire a complete backup solution with an extended runtime  we have introduced the coolair ups that couples our coolair dc product with a third party double conversion ups 
the coolair product family comprised approximately of our total revenue during the coolair market at its current power levels  the coolair product primarily competes in the kva ups power market against conventional battery based ups systems 
according to an independent market analysis of the global ups market by frost sullivan  this segment represented approximately of the global ups market in  with annual sales of approximately billion  and is projected to grow at an annual rate of approximately through the primary customers in this power level include mission critical and large scale equipment  and typically are sold for operator centers  telecommunication equipment switching gear  broadcasting equipment  imaging diagnostic equipment  small and medium size data centers  and process and automation equipment 
at this power level  compared to the market for our flywheel business  a greater percentage of sales is made regionally by local resellers 
it is estimated that less than one third of sales are made directly  compared to two thirds in the greater than kva segment 
frost sullivan estimated sales growth in the kva market at approximately in  faster than the growth rate in the overall ups market  particularly in north america and asia  driven by strong demand in the healthcare  high tech manufacturing and the financial services industries 
frost sullivan also expects this segment to continue to grow faster than the overall ups market 
the primary drivers of growth in this segment are similar to those in our flywheel market and include renewed it and process upgrades which are increasing power requirements for many organizations and forcing end users to upgrade their existing power infrastructure 
at this lower power level there are more competitors  
table of contents particularly from asia  which has contributed towards higher price competition and commoditization of product due to lack of innovation 
competitors have sourced manufacturing offshore to mitigate the effects of this price competition 
applications in this power segment are often mission critical  which means a high level of user involvement and interaction between the supplier and customer during the purchase process to ensure proper configuration  service  assurance  level of reliability and delivery 
this leads to increased involvement of local manufacturers representatives and local consulting or electrical engineers in the sales process 
often the choice of sales channel varies by geographic region due to local alliances  local tariffs and regional voltages  as well as a supplier s position in a given market 
like the high power market  brand and service capabilities are important competitive differentiators 
if a workstation or equipment fails  customers may suffer potentially significant economic losses 
this increased awareness and application criticality have led to an increased level of brand loyalty in this market 
customers want high reliability and features such as product certifications  high power correction factors  maintenance bypass features and monitoring services 
these customers also recognize the need for service and after sales maintenance 
ups products have become more reliable and robust over time  but the backup battery system remains a prevalent source of failure in ups systems 
as a result  monitoring services are as valuable to customers as maintenance 
as most of these ups systems are used in conjunction with an application  growth in the ups market should be tied to growth in the application market 
however  in recent years the proliferation of the internet and pcs has been the primary driver of growth 
overall  brand recognition and service capabilities are the most likely basis of competition due to the maturity of the markets and the lack of product innovation to differentiate similar product offerings 
the ability to offer space savings  higher reliability and better service often will determine success in a market  although some markets  particularly in asia  continue to be driven primarily by price 
thermal and compressed air storage system technology in september we first introduced a new battery free technology that utilizes thermal and compressed air storage tacas systems to provide backup power for an extended runtime minutes to hours while simultaneously providing backup cooling during an electrical outage or disturbance 
during standby operation when utility power is present  breathable compressed air can be used as an energy source stored in standard air cylinders 
a nominal amount of electricity is used to keep the thermal storage material heated at the proper temperature using basic and redundant electric heating elements 
in the event of a power disturbance  a valve is opened releasing the compressed air  which is routed through the thermal storage unit to gain additional energy 
this heated air is then applied to an air motor expansion turbine that spins at high speeds and turns a permanent magnet alternator  which  in turn generates power that is used to support the critical load 
depending on the application  this product provides backup power for minutes to hours 
when utility power is restored  the system can electrically recharge by using some electricity to compress air back into the cylinders and to re heat the thermal storage material 
the byproduct from operation of this system is a discharge of cool air which can be used to cool electronic equipment in the room prior to an orderly data center shutdown or until the data center cooling systems are restored on generator or utility power 

table of contents the following graphic depicts the tacas system logo coolair products coolair dc our first product based on this tacas technology platform is being marketed as coolair dc 
while coolair dc provides extended runtimes similar to battery solutions  it does so without any of the inherent limitations of batteries related to reliability  manageability and maintainability 
coolair dc utilizes readily available compressed air and thermal energy storage along with simple and reliable mechanical components that combine to produce a predictable and reliable source of dc power that does not degrade over time 
in addition  coolair dc has the capability to provide backup cooling that has become an important requirement of today s datacenters because of ever increasing power densities 
in december  we shipped our first coolair dc evaluation unit 
we recorded our first sale of a coolair dc in december  and began commercial production during the second quarter of coolair dc was developed to meet the needs of the market where customers require minutes to hours of backup power because they typically do not have backup generators 
based on our primary research  we believe a substantial portion of customers within the three phase ups market in north america do not have a backup generator and require extended runtimes between and minutes 
similarly  this market segment does not typically have their hvac system on backup power so that during an outage critical equipment is not being cooled  even if it has backup power 
thus  having the coolair dc expel cool air during a power interruption can be of value to these customers by reducing the possibility of a thermal shutdown and allowing critical equipment to run for a longer duration in the event of an extended power outage 
coolair dc is flexible in its configuration and can easily extend the runtime by simply adding more compressed air tanks 
applications demanding such extended runtime are  for example  the mid range ups market roughly defined as to kva  where minutes of backup power is required to allow the customer to shut down its critical equipment in an orderly manner 
the coolair dc system is currently available for a power rating from to kw 

table of contents coolair dc has lower expected lifecycle costs than battery solutions due to its projected year lifespan  as well as comparatively low maintenance and replacement part requirements 
in some instances  the initial cost of coolair dc may be higher than batteries for a customer 
to help mitigate this upfront financial impact on customers  we are offering customers a usage or lease option in addition to a purchase option 
the usage option includes warranty  maintenance and testing for a single price per year during a  or year agreement 
the usage model spreads out the payments over an agreed term  and offers customers a consistent  predictable cost over time 
coolair dc can be sold with a ups or sold into existing ups installations to replace a customer s lead acid batteries 
coolair ups to provide the fastest route to market for a complete ups solution for our customers requiring extended runtime  we have teamed with a division of general electric corporation to provide an active power branded ups  which is marketed as coolair ups 
this coolair ups solution leverages the tacas technology and simply couples the coolair dc unit with a ge sourced double conversion ups 
we can also sell the ge sourced double conversion ups directly to customers without the coolair dc 
in addition to all the energy storage benefits of the tacas technology listed above  coolair ups also provides benefits such as tighter voltage regulation and better transient response that leads to much improved output power quality relative to our competitors ups products 
with the ability to parallel the ge sourced ups  multiple coolair ups systems may be connected in parallel to create a backup power system up to kva 
coolair customers we began commercially selling coolair dc in the second quarter of  and so our customer base is limited 
however  some of the markets and applications that we have already shipped or sold into include the following industry application utilities research laboratory  load leveling semiconductor manufacturing chip manufacturing  process manufacturing academic institutions data center operations financial institutions data center  travel center operations solar cell manufacturing load leveling competition coolair dc competes primarily against battery cabinet offerings for kva ups provided by suppliers such as eaton electrical  liebert  american power conversion and mge ups systems 
to our knowledge  there are no commercially available battery free extended runtime products other than coolair within this market space 
coolair dc provides extended runtimes similar to batteries  without any of their inherent limitations related to reliability  manageability and maintainability 
in addition  coolair dc has the capability to provide back up cooling that has become an important requirement of today s data centers because of the ever increasing power densities that generate heat within data centers 
our ability to compete effectively with the coolair dc product will primarily depend on the rate of acceptance of this new technology in the small to medium business segment 
coolair ups is a kva double conversion ups solution that utilizes the tacas technology for energy storage 
with the coolair ups  we compete against battery based ups solutions provided by the same group of competitors as mentioned above 
our ability to succeed within this space is also strongly dependent on the acceptance of the tacas technology within this market segment 
a differentiated offering and a strong value proposition for customers have allowed us to sign various top power quality manufacturers representatives to carry coolair ups as their primary ups offering 
this manufacturers representative channel now provides significant coverage for the coolair ups throughout united states 

table of contents sales and marketing for the last several years our sales and marketing activities were focused principally on training and supporting our oem customers 
since we have hosted numerous caterpillar dealers and eaton electrical sales representatives to promote awareness of our ups and dc products and to demonstrate the capabilities and market opportunities of these products 
we also implemented several programs aimed at increasing oem engagement and focusing on selling our products and have conducted regular intensive sales programs focused on enabling and educating our oem partners throughout the united states and in europe 
these sales programs are used to increase product awareness and sales effectiveness 
our primary sales channels in north america have traditionally been through our oem partners  caterpillar and eaton electrical 
as we began to broaden our sales channels in and  we shifted the focus of our sales and marketing activities to direct sales  while still supporting our existing channel partners 
in we undertook a campaign to recruit regional manufacturers representatives in the united states and canada  and added direct sales employees and sales agents for certain products and geographic regions  particularly in europe  to increase our market coverage 
in we have been growing our geographically dispersed direct sales force to focus on direct customer relationships within specific geographic regions and particularly on specific national accounts 
direct sales tend to improve our relationships with customers  improve our gross margins and add service revenue opportunities 
our primary sales channels in emea include direct sales and select vars 
we also provide services including engineering  installation  start up  monitoring  and repair for our products under contracts with our customers 
our marketing efforts focus on developing and sustaining key relationships with industry influencers  such as design engineers  and our channel partners  participating in trade shows to promote the brand and launch our products  and equipping and training our active power salespeople and our channel partners 
we also work with oem partners on promotional activities such as advertising development  direct mail and seminar strategies 
we use our marketing resources to stimulate end user interest through trade press articles  participation in industry conferences  online marketing  and limited direct mail to specific power quality prospects 
in and we increased our marketing efforts in support of our direct selling activities in an effort to increase sales of active power branded products and services 
service and support we have made it a priority to sell service contracts directly to our end users to parallel our increased efforts to build our global direct sales force 
in we began focusing on increasing our service revenues through increased customer coverage and additional value add service offerings 
we anticipate that in our service revenues will substantially grow through the direct sale of active power service contracts  parts  training  and installation 
as we increase direct sales under the active power brand  we believe that this will provide us with more opportunities to increase the number of relationships with end user customers and therefore increase service and support revenues from those customers 
similar to our sales and marketing activities  prior to we focused on educating and training our oem customers on the service and maintenance of our products 
we believed their engagement reduced the need for us to have a large internal support organization by enabling our oems to provide installation  service and primary support to their customers 
we also expanded our service coverage areas and entered into strategic partnerships to broaden our service reach in areas where it was impractical or inefficient to staff active power employees 
the training programs are hosted at our austin  texas location where we have a sophisticated training facility  and where the service people can get hands on experience with our products 
all of our oem customers must be certified by active power in order to service our products 

table of contents we will continue to support our oem partners who sell service contracts for our products to their customers 
we understand the importance of supporting service in these oem channels as we shift to our multi channel sales strategy 
research and development we believe that our research and development efforts are essential to our ability to successfully deliver innovative products that address the needs of our customers as the market for power quality products evolves 
our research and development team works closely with our marketing and sales team and oems to define product requirements to address the specific needs of the power quality market 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will stay at similar levels to but decrease as a percentage of sales in the future  which is consistent with our strategy to focus on the phase environment for which a core platform now exists 
at december   our research  development and engineering team consisted of engineers and technicians 
manufacturing we source the majority of our components from contract manufacturers to enhance our ability to scale our operations and minimize cost 
this approach allows us to respond quickly to customer orders while maintaining high quality standards 
our internal manufacturing process consists of the fabrication of certain components  as well as the assembly  functional testing and quality control of our finished products 
we also test components  parts and subassemblies obtained from suppliers for quality control purposes 
we have entered into long term agreements with some of our key suppliers  but currently purchase most of our components on a purchase order basis 
although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible  we purchase a particular type of power module from semikron international  which is a single source supplier 
we  and our power module supplier  currently maintain buffer stocks to avoid potential supply disruptions 
lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms  the extensive production time required and current market demand for such components 
during our manufacturing facility was expanded to support projected sales volume  however  due to an economic downturn and lower revenue levels than previously projected  much of that capacity is currently underutilized 
in the future  we will consider leveraging our excess capacity and expertise by manufacturing and or testing third party power equipment 
we believe that our current workforce  facilities and inventory levels will be sufficient to handle our near term sales demand 
over time we will need to hire additional manufacturing personnel to address anticipated sales volume increases 
strategic relationships caterpillar in we established a strategic relationship with caterpillar  pursuant to which we granted caterpillar the worldwide right to distribute many of our cleansource ups products under the cat ups brand name 
caterpillar is a market leader in new generator sales and has the largest installed base of existing standby generators in the world 
by offering the cat ups with a standby generator  caterpillar can transform a standby power system into a cps 
the combined solution reduces maintenance costs and increases reliability relative to traditional cps products 
moreover  because caterpillar s product line now includes both a ups and a generator along with switchgear caterpillar is now selling  caterpillar can install and service a complete cps under a single and very recognizable brand name 
we believe that this total solution gives both caterpillar and active power a significant competitive advantage in the power quality market 

table of contents ups development agreement 
we entered into a development agreement with caterpillar in january for the creation and distribution of a ups marketed under the caterpillar brand name 
under this agreement  caterpillar invested million in this development 
we began shipments of the cat ups in while we retained sole ownership of the underlying flywheel energy storage technology  we jointly own with caterpillar intellectual property directed to the integration of ups electronics with the cleansource flywheel technology 
either we or caterpillar may license to others the intellectual property that we jointly own without seeking the consent of the other and the licensing party will solely retain all licensing revenue generated by licensing the joint intellectual property 
however  we were not to license the joint intellectual property to specifically identified competitors of caterpillar until january  to date  neither party has licensed the technology to a third party 
we entered into a second development with caterpillar in september to develop a high power flywheel ups platform that caterpillar may ship under the cat ups brand name 
caterpillar invested an additional million in this development 
we began shipping this high power ups in the third quarter of distribution agreement 
under our distribution agreement with caterpillar  we sell cat ups equipment to them at set prices 
during   and  we received approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue from caterpillar and its dealer network under this agreement 
the principal provisions of this distribution agreement are summarized below caterpillar has semi exclusive worldwide rights to distribute cat ups under the caterpillar brand name  if caterpillar meets minimum semi annual sales requirements  we will not sell cat ups to specifically identified competitors of caterpillar until january  or the termination of the distribution agreement caterpillar has not met the minimum annual sales requirements  and we will provide caterpillar the same warranty caterpillar provides to its customers who purchase electric power generation products one year from delivery to the end user 
under our existing agreement  caterpillar had the right to distribute cat ups until january  at such time the agreement continues for additional six month periods unless either party provides to the other  within ninety days of the end of a period  written notice of its decision not to renew the distribution agreement 
the agreement may also be terminated by caterpillar if we fail to cure any material breach by us  if the cat ups we manufacture consistently and materially fails to meet our published specifications  or if we substantially and continuously fail to meet agreed shipment dates for products ordered by caterpillar 
finally  either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a change of control of the other 
to date  sales by caterpillar have been short of the contractual minimums necessary for caterpillar to retain semi exclusivity  however  we have continued to work with caterpillar as our primary ups oem customer and have not sold the ups to any of caterpillar s identified competitors 
the initial term of our agreement with caterpillar expired in january  and the agreement was automatically renewed for an additional six month period 
we are currently in the process of renegotiating a new multi year renewal of this agreement with caterpillar on substantially similar terms as our existing agreement  and currently believe that caterpillar intends to renew the agreement  although there can be no assurance that such renewal will take place 
eaton electrical eaton electrical is a global leader in power systems technology and has a broad range of ups products and services available worldwide 
eaton electrical sells and services the cleansource dc product with its own ups  delivering a battery free backup power solution 
eaton electrical has a well established sales and service network that allows it to provide an effective sales channel and quality service to our end users around the world 
we recently renewed our worldwide distribution agreement with a one year term that gives eaton electrical the non exclusive right to distribute and sell the cleansource dc worldwide 
eaton electrical is under no obligation to purchase any cleansource dc units from us 

table of contents ge consumer and industrial purchase agreement 
we have a purchase agreement with ge consumer and industrial formerly ge digital energy  a division of general electric responsible for power quality equipment 
ge has the non exclusive right to purchase and sell our cleansource dc products 
sales of our products through this channel were negligible in and sourcing agreement 
during  ge zenith controls and active power entered into a long term supply agreement for uninterruptible power supplies and related accessories 
this agreement allows us to buy and resell ge s hz double conversion ups line in north america 
in we began selling these ge ups systems on a stand alone basis themselves  and in we began selling these systems along side our coolair dc product through our direct and manufacturers representative sales channels 
other cleansource dc distributors in addition to caterpillar  eaton electrical and ge  we have distribution agreements with other oem customers that have coverage in other geographical areas eg  japan  india and the republic of south korea 
to date  none of these distributors has generated significant revenue for us 
proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks  as well as confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions with employees and third parties  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have filed dozens of patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  of which have been issued as patents 
additionally  we have made a concerted effort to obtain patent protection abroad for our technology by continuing to file patent applications in europe and asia 
our patent strategy is critical for preserving our rights in and to the intellectual property embodied in our cleansource and coolair product lines  as well as in newer technologies 
as a manufactured  tangible device that is sold rather than licensed  our products do not qualify for copyright or trade secret protection 
to enforce our ownership of such technology  we principally rely on the protection obtained through the patents we own  as well as unfair competition laws 
we intend to aggressively protect our patents  which would include bringing legal actions if we deem it advisable 
we own the registered trademarks active power  active power logo  cleansource and making electricity better in the united states 
all other trademarks  service marks or trade names referred to in this report are the property of their respective owners 
employees at december   we had employees  with engaged in research and development  in manufacturing  sourcing and service  in sales and marketing  and in administration  information technology and finance 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
seasonality our business has  on occasion  experienced seasonal customer buying patterns 
in recent years  we have generally experienced relatively weaker demand in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we believe that this pattern will continue 
in addition  we anticipate that demand for our products in europe and africa may decline in the summer months  as compared to other regions  because of reduced corporate buying patterns during the vacation season

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock or in evaluating active power and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know  or that we currently view as immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
the actual occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the matters relating to the investigation by the special committee of our board of directors into our stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements may result in future litigation or regulatory inquiries which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on january   we announced that the board of directors had appointed a special committee and that this committee  with the assistance of the company s outside legal advisers  as well as accounting and tax experts  was conducting a review of our stock option granting practices from the time of our initial public offering in august through december on february  the company announced that the special committee had reached certain preliminary conclusions in the investigation 
specifically  the special committee had come to the conclusion that the actual measurement date for certain past stock option grants differed from the stated grant date for such awards  which would result in additional charges to the company for stock based compensation expenses 
at the time of that disclosure  the amount of such additional charges was unknown 
on march  the company announced that the company  the audit committee and the board of directors had determined  based on information provided by the special committee and its advisors  that the amount of additional stock based compensation expense to be recognized would be material 
therefore  we concluded that our previously filed unaudited interim and audited annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended december     and including associated interim periods  as well as the unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended march   june  and september  should no longer be relied upon because these financial statements contained amounts that would need to be restated 
we disclosed this conclusion in our current report on form k  filed with the sec on march  various representatives of the company  including members of the audit committee  the board of directors  the special committee and authorized officers  discussed those matters with the company s independent auditors  ernst young llp  prior to filing that current report on form k 
this review of our historical stock option granting practices has required us to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  and has diverted our management s attention from our business  and could in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 
there can be no guarantee that any such litigation or regulatory reviews will reach the same conclusions as that of the special committee 
the conduct and resolution of these matters could be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business 
we voluntarily contacted the united states securities and exchange commission sec regarding the special committee s investigation into our stock option granting practices and have agreed to share the results of the special committee with the sec 
we have received requests for voluntary production of documents from the sec and we are fully cooperating with the sec 
while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in concluding the correct measurement dates for stock option grants and option modifications  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option errors  and there is a risk 
table of contents that any sec inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  or otherwise take actions not currently contemplated 
any such circumstances could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and possible delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global market 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these other matters  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
please see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our quarterly report on form q was required to have been filed by may  on may  we filed a form b extension  which automatically extended that deadline until may  if we are unable to file our quarterly report prior to may   we may receive notice from the nasdaq stock market staff of an additional failure to maintain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
we have incurred significant losses and anticipate losses for at least the next several quarters 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next several quarters 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have funded our operations principally through the public and private sale of our stock  product revenue and million in development funding from caterpillar 
we will need to generate significant additional revenue in order to achieve profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will ever realize such revenue levels 
we also expect to incur product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses significantly in excess of our product revenue after costs  and  as a result  we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several quarters 
due to our limited operating history and the uncertain market acceptance of our products  we may never achieve significant revenue and may have difficulty accurately predicting revenue for future periods and appropriately budgeting for expenses 
as of december   we have generated a total of million in product revenue since january   with million generated in the year ended december  we are uncertain whether our products will achieve market acceptance such that our revenue will increase or whether we will be able to achieve significant revenue 
therefore  we have a very limited ability to predict future revenue 
our limited operating experience  the uncertain market acceptance for our products  and other factors that are beyond our control make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our quarterly and annual revenue 
however  we use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget 
most of our expenses  particularly rent and salaries  are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our expenses  if desired  in a timely manner to offset any revenue shortfall 
if our revenue does not increase as anticipated  we will continue to incur significant losses 
as a result of the foregoing  we cannot assure you that our revenues will grow or remain stable in future periods or that we will become profitable 
in addition  in some future quarters  our financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
if we do not achieve significant sales of our coolair products  we may be forced to take an impairment charge for inventory we keep relating to that product line 
at december   we had approximately million in inventory relating exclusively to our coolair family of products 
during our sales of coolair products did not meet our expectations 
if we are unable to sell sufficient quantities of our finished coolair products  we may not be able to make use of this inventory and we may therefore determine that those assets are impaired 
if we find that our inventory assets relating to the coolair products are significantly impaired  we will be required to record a charge for some or all of the value of that inventory  which would have the effect of reducing our net income in the period when the impairment determination is made 

table of contents our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our product revenue  operating expenses and quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result you should not rely on our operating results during any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance in any quarterly period or fiscal year 
these factors include  among others timing of orders from our customers and the possibility that customers may change their order requirements with little or no notice to us  rate of adoption of our flywheel based energy storage system or our thermal and compressed air system as alternatives to lead acid batteries  ongoing need for short term power outage protection in traditional ups systems  deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products from us or other providers of power quality systems  timing of deferred revenue components associated with large orders  new product releases  licensing or pricing decisions by our competitors  commodity and raw material component prices  lack of order backlog  loss of a significant customer or distributor  impact of changes to our product distribution strategy and pricing policies  changes in the mix of domestic and international sales  rate of growth of the markets for our products  and other risks described below 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from relatively few large transactions 
the sales cycle for these large transactions tend to be longer than the sales cycle on smaller orders 
the longer sales cycle for large transactions makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which these sales will occur 
accordingly  our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the existence and timing of larger transactions 
a reduction in the number of large transactions  or a delay in closing of such a sales transaction could materially impact our revenue in a particular period 
the market for power quality products is evolving and it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate 
most of the organizations that may purchase our products have invested substantial resources in their existing power systems and  as a result  have been reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach  particularly during a period of reduced capital expenditures 
moreover  our current products are alternatives to existing ups and battery based systems and may never be accepted by our customers or may be made obsolete by other advances in power quality technologies 
significant portions of our expenses are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to decreases in revenue 
therefore  if our revenue is below our expectations  our operating results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected 
in addition  we may change our prices  modify our distribution strategy and policies  accelerate our investment in research and development  sales or marketing efforts in response to competitive pressures or to pursue new market opportunities 
any one of these activities may further limit our ability to adjust spending in response to revenue fluctuations 
we use forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget 
because most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue  any shortfall in revenue may result in significant losses 

table of contents we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from international markets and plan to continue to expand such efforts  which subjects us to additional business risks including increased logistical and financial complexity  political instability and currency fluctuations 
the percentage of our product revenue derived from customers located outside of the united states was  and in  and  respectively 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including foreign laws and business practices that favor local competition  dependence on local channel partners  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the associated effects on product demand and timing of payment  political and economic stability  particularly in the middle east and north africa  greater difficulty in the contracting and shipping process and in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  greater difficulty in hiring qualified technical sales and application engineers  and difficulties with financial reporting in foreign countries 
to date  the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase  thus rendering our products less competitive 
as we increase direct sales in foreign markets  we are making more sales that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro 
those sales in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations 
however  we may engage in hedging activities in the future 
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of products  and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success 
our future success will also depend on our ability to reduce our dependence on these few products by developing and introducing to the market new products and product enhancements in a timely manner 
specifically  our ability to capture significant market share depends on our ability to develop and market extensions to our existing ups product line at higher and lower power range offerings  and on our ability to develop and market our extended runtime products  such as the coolair dc 
even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements  they may not achieve market acceptance  which would substantially impair our revenue  profitability and overall financial prospects 
successful product development and market acceptance of our existing and future products depend on a number of factors including changing requirements of customers  accurate prediction of market and technical requirements  timely completion and introduction of new designs  quality  price and performance of our products  
table of contents availability  quality  price and performance of competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers  and changes in technology  industry standards or end user preferences 
we must expand our distribution channels and manage our existing and new product distribution relationships to continue to grow our business 
the future growth of our business will depend in part on our ability to expand our existing relationships with distributors  to identify and develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products and to manage these relationships 
as part of our growth strategy  we may expand our relationships with distributors and develop relationships with new distributors  such as we did in the fourth quarter of with four new distributor agreements for the asian market  predominantly in korea  and india 
we will also look to identify and develop new relationships with additional parties that could serve as an outlet for our products  including coolair dc 
we also entered into a long term supply agreement with ge zenith controls in to source ups systems from them that we intend to sell along side our coolair dc product 
our inability to successfully execute this strategy  and to integrate and manage our existing oem channel partners  caterpillar and eaton electric  and our new manufacturer s representatives could impede our future growth 
we must continue to hire and retain skilled personnel 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
there is a limited supply of skilled employees in the power quality marketplace 
a decline in our stock price can result in a substantial number of underwater stock options  whereby the exercise price of the option is greater than the current market value of our common stock 
as a result  the financial attractiveness of the stock options is substantially diminished  which may cause certain of our employees to seek employment elsewhere as a result of this decreased financial incentive  or impair our ability to recruit new employees 
our efforts to attract and retain highly skilled employees could be harmed by our past or any future workforce reductions 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel who are essential to our product development  marketing  sales  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can develop new products or generate revenue 
if we are unable to retain the personnel we currently employ  or if we are unable to quickly replace departing employees  our operations and new product development may suffer 
we are significantly dependent on our relationship with caterpillar  our primary oem customer 
if this relationship is unsuccessful  for whatever reason  our business and financial prospects would likely suffer 
caterpillar and its dealer network are our primary oem customer for our flywheel based products 
caterpillar and its dealer network accounted for  and of our revenue  during  and  respectively 
if our relationship with caterpillar is not successful  or if caterpillar s distribution of the cat ups product is not successful or suffers a material change  our business and financial prospects would likely suffer 
pursuant to our distribution agreement with caterpillar  they are the exclusive oem distributor  subject to limited exceptions  of our cleansource ups product 
caterpillar is not obligated to purchase any cleansource ups units 
pursuant to our development agreements caterpillar has provided us with million in funding to support the development of the cat ups product line and other development efforts 
in exchange for these payments  caterpillar received co ownership of the proprietary rights in this product 
either caterpillar or active power may license to others the intellectual property that we jointly own without seeking the consent of the other  and the licensing party will solely retain all licensing revenue generated by licensing this intellectual property 
we are currently in the process of renegotiating a new multi year extension of our oem distributor agreement with caterpillar on substantially the same terms as the existing agreement 
if we are unable to successfully renegotiate this agreement  our business and financial prospects would suffer materially 

table of contents we have underutilized manufacturing capacity and have no experience manufacturing our products in large quantities 
in  we completed and equipped a  square foot facility used for manufacturing and testing of our three phase product line  including our dc and ups products 
to be financially successful  and to fully utilize the capacity of this facility and allocate its associated overhead  we must achieve significantly higher sales volumes 
we must accomplish this while also preserving the quality levels we achieved when manufacturing these products in more limited quantities 
to date  we have not been successful at increasing our sales volume to a level that fully utilizes the capacity of the facility and we may never increase our sales volume to necessary levels 
we intend to manufacture and test our coolair dc product in this facility  which will help increase the utilization of our facility 
if we do not reach these necessary sales volume levels  or if we cannot sell our products at our suggested prices  our ability to reach profitability will be materially limited 
achieving the necessary production levels presents a number of technological and engineering challenges for us 
we have not previously manufactured our products in high volume 
we do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient  low cost manufacturing capability and processes that will enable us to meet the quality  price  engineering  design and product standards or production volumes required to successfully manufacture large quantities of our products 
even if we are successful in developing our manufacturing capability and processes  we do not know whether we will do so in time to meet our product commercialization schedule or to satisfy the requirements of our customers 
we must build quality products to ensure acceptance of our products 
the market perception of our products and related acceptance of the products is highly dependent upon the quality and reliability of the products that we build 
any quality problems attributable to the cleansource dc  cleansource ups or coolair dc product lines may substantially impair our revenue prospects 
moreover  quality problems for our product lines could cause us to delay or cease shipments of products or have to recall or field upgrade products  thus adversely affecting our ability to meet revenue or cost targets 
in addition  while we seek to limit our liability as a result of product failure or defects through warranty and other limitations  if one of our products fails  a customer could suffer a significant loss and seek to hold us responsible for that loss 
we currently operate without a significant backlog 
we generally operate our business without any significant backlog of orders from customers 
normally our products are shipped and revenue is recognized shortly after the order is received 
this lack of backlog makes revenue in any quarter substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
seasonality may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our business has  on occasion  experienced seasonal customer buying patterns 
in recent years  we have generally experienced relatively weaker demand in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we believe that this pattern will continue 
in addition  we anticipate that demand for our products in europe and africa may decline in the summer months  as compared to other regions  because of reduced corporate buying patterns during the vacation season 
we depend on sole and limited source suppliers  and outsource selected component manufacturing 
we purchase several component parts from sole source and limited source suppliers 
as a result of our current volumes  we lack significant leverage with these suppliers 
if our suppliers receive excess demand for their products  we may receive a low priority for order fulfillment as large volume customers will receive priority that may result in delays in our acquiring components 
if we are delayed in acquiring components for our products  the manufacture and shipment of our products also will be delayed 
we are  however  continuing to 
table of contents enter into long term agreements with our sole suppliers and other key suppliers  when available  using a rolling sales volume forecast to stabilize component availability 
lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms  the extensive production time required and current market demand for such components 
some of these delays may be substantial 
as a result  we purchase several components in large quantities to protect our ability to deliver finished products 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which will increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we will have inadequate inventory  which will delay our manufacturing and render us unable to deliver products to customers on scheduled delivery dates 
if we are unable to obtain a component from a supplier or if the price of a component has increased substantially  we may be required to manufacture the component internally  which will also result in delays or be required to absorb price increases 
manufacturing delays could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and could damage our customer relationships 
to assure the availability of our products to our customers  we outsource the manufacturing of selected components prior to the receipt of purchase orders from customers based on their forecasts of their product needs and internal product sales revenue forecasts 
however  these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments from our customers 
we do not recognize revenue for such products until the product is shipped to the customer 
as a result  we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenue 
as demand for our products may not materialize  this product delivery method subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs  obsolescence and excess  and may increase our operating costs 
in addition  we may from time to time make design changes to our products  which could lead to obsolescence of inventory 
we face significant competition from other companies 
the markets for power quality and power reliability are intensely competitive 
there are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and alternative ups and backup systems in the united states and abroad  including  among others  major electric and specialized electronics firms  as well as universities  research institutions and foreign government sponsored companies 
there are many companies that are developing flywheel based energy storage systems and flywheel based power quality systems 
we may face future competition from companies that are developing other types of emerging power technologies  such as high speed composite flywheels  ultra capacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader name and brand recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors have established supplier or joint development relationships with our current or potential customers 
these competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing products from us or to persuade them to replace our products with their products 
increased competition could decrease our prices  reduce our sales  lower our margins  or decrease our market share 
these and other competitive pressures could prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors and could materially harm our business 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology  and we expect that future technological advancements made by us will be critical to sustain market acceptance of our products 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners and control access to and distribution of our software  
table of contents documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where applicable laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  the measures we undertake may not be sufficient to adequately protect our proprietary technology and may not preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to those of our products 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or defend allegations of infringement asserted by others 
legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our intellectual property rights 
any litigation  regardless of its merits or its outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions  including cease selling our products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology or trademark  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property or cease to use an infringing trademark  or cease to use an infringing trademark 
we may require substantial additional funds in the future to finance our product development and commercialization plans 
our product development and commercialization schedule could be delayed if we are unable to fund our research and development activities  marketing activities or the development of our manufacturing capabilities with our revenue and our cash on hand 
we expect that our current cash and investments  together with other available sources of working capital  will be sufficient to fund corporate cash requirements for at least twelve months 
however  unforeseen delays or difficulties in these activities could increase costs and exhaust our resources prior to the full commercialization of our products under development 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
we have anti takeover provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent our acquisition 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
additionally  in december our board of directors approved a stockholder rights plan  which would require a potential acquiror to negotiate directly with our board of directors regarding any planned acquisition 
we also are subject to the anti takeover laws of the state of delaware  which may further discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
in addition  our agreement with caterpillar for the distribution of cleansource ups provides that caterpillar may terminate the agreement in the event we are acquired or undergo a change in control 
the possible loss of our most significant customer could be a significant deterrent to possible acquirers and may substantially limit the number of possible acquirers 
all of these factors may decrease the likelihood that we would be acquired  which may depress the market price of our common stock 

table of contents volatility in our stock price could result in claims against us 
historically the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the sales price of our common stock ranged from to 
in addition to those risks described earlier in this section  the market price of our common stock can be expected to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  particularly those that sell products used in power quality systems  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for flywheel energy storage systems  the loss of one or more key oem customers  inability to successfully expand our distribution channels  departures of key personnel  and changing external capital market conditions

while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in concluding the correct measurement dates for stock option grants and option modifications  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date and option modification errors  and there is a risk that any sec inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  or otherwise take actions not currently contemplated

restatement of consolidated financial statements  special committee and company findings  remedial measures and related proceedings restatement of consolidated financial statements in november  as a result of his experiences as a member of a special committee conducting a review of the stock option granting practices at another public company  one of our directors began to inquire about the company s own option granting practices 
an initial review presented no apparent issues 
as a follow up to this request  and in response to questions raised by our external auditor  current management further documented and reviewed the company s historical option grants for the prior two years and discovered potentially problematic documentation 
management promptly communicated its concerns to the board in december  and the board appointed a special committee of independent directors to oversee an internal investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures 
we regard the special committee as independent because the members thereof had minimal roles in the company s option granting or compensation practices and or were not members of the company s board of directors for the majority of the period under review 
the special committee considered and evaluated all grants made during the period from the date of the company s initial public offering in august through december the special committee retained outside legal counsel on december  to assist in and manage the project 
subsequently  legal counsel retained an international  independent national consulting firm to provide accounting and forensic assistance and an independent outside accounting firm to provide tax advice 
the investigation included the evaluation of all stock option grants made during the review period  which encompassed  individual stock option grants to purchase more than million shares of our common stock made on grant dates 
the special committee s legal and forensic advisors reviewed thousands of pages of hard copy and electronic documents  captured and analyzed gigabytes of electronic information  including over  files and email messages  and conducted formal interviews with current and former officers  directors and employees 
current members of our management team cooperated fully with the special committee s investigation 
on february  the company announced that the special committee had reached certain preliminary conclusions in the investigation 
specifically  the special committee had come to the conclusion that the actual measurement date for certain past stock option grants differed from the stated grant date for such awards  which would result in additional charges to the company for stock based compensation expenses 
at the time of that disclosure  the amount of such additional charges was unknown 
on march  the company announced that the company  the audit committee and the board of directors had determined  based on information provided by the special committee and its advisors  that the amount of additional stock based compensation expense to be recognized would be material 
therefore  we concluded that our previously filed unaudited interim and audited annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended december     and including associated interim periods  as well as the unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended march   june  and september  should no longer be relied upon because 
table of contents these financial statements contained amounts that would need to be restated 
we disclosed this conclusion in our current report on form k  filed with the sec on march  various representatives of the company  including members of the audit committee  the board of directors  the special committee and authorized officers  discussed those matters with the company s independent auditors  ernst young llp  prior to filing that current report on form k 
as a result of the special committee s investigation  we recorded additional stock based compensation expense and related tax liabilities for annual and quarterly periods during the review period 
specifically  in this filing  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and the selected consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended december     and  to correctly account for improper measurement dates for stock option grants  including those relating to stock option plan administration deficiencies  delays in completing granting actions and paperwork  and mischaracterization of stock option grant dates  modifications to stock option grants including repricing and extensions of vesting and exercise periods in connection with terminations of employment and extended leaves of absence  stock option grants to non employees previously accounted for as grants to employees  and tax liabilities  including liabilities related to employee stock purchase plan administration deficiencies and liabilities associated with the misclassification of stock option grants as incentive stock options  or isos  and the resulting under reporting or under withholding of income and payroll taxes on certain stock option exercises 
in addition to the adjustments related to the stock option review  these restated consolidated financial statements include an adjustment to decrease general and administrative expenses in by  and to increase general and administrative expenses in and by  and  respectively  to reflect the correct accounting for sales taxes due as a result of a multi year state sales tax audit 
this sales tax audit was completed and the total amount due originally recorded in  and we have now recorded the expense in the correct accounting periods 
the adjustments also affected periods prior to that are not restated in these financial statements 
we previously had determined these adjustments were not material to our previously reported financial results  but our need to restate prior results in connection with the stock option review has provided the opportunity to simultaneously correct those earlier disclosures 
these adjustments are not otherwise related to the stock option review

certain amounts reflected in the table are the result of errors from earlier periods due to the accounting treatment for such errors that requires the amortization of the associated compensation expense over multiple periods as the underlying options vest 
most of the errors related to discrepancies between the actual measurement dates for certain option grants and the stated grant dates of such awards 
based on the results of the special committee s review  the company was able to determine the actual measurement dates for affected options with certainty 
as a result of the special committee s investigation  we have determined the following inappropriate practices prior to may  the special committee s review of our stock option granting practices identified the use of the following improper practices by certain former members of our senior management during the period from august   the date of our initial public offering  to may   the date on which mr 
clishem was appointed to replace mr 
pinkerton as the company s chief executive officer 
several of these improper practices overlapped with respect to many option grants 
as the company determined the total financial impact of the associated errors  primarily by resolving discrepancies between the actual measurement dates for certain option grants and the stated grant dates of such awards  several improper practices may have contributed to any given incorrect measurement date 
therefore  the financial impact of the various types of errors described below is not cumulative 
beginning in may  the regular practice of certain former members of our senior management was to select option grant dates and exercise prices with the benefit of hindsight ie backdating 
the backdating practices of certain former members of our senior management generally utilized a so called window of opportunity to select grant dates and exercise prices with the benefit of hindsight  ranging from a few days to several weeks  that corresponded with the date of the lowest closing price for our shares during the period in question 
these backdating practices were utilized in connection with grants to existing employees including annual option grants we have historically made to a large number of our employees each year  generally during the first fiscal quarter 
the total financial impact of these errors was approximately  and is included in the category adjustment 
the special committee also found that in some instances the exercise price was set before a definitive list of optionees and the actual number of option shares to be granted to each optionee was finalized 
we have determined that additional stock based compensation expense relating to these grants must be recorded 
the total financial impact of these errors was approximately  and is included in the category adjustment 
separately  certain grants prior to may were approved by unanimous written consent uwc of our compensation committee with an effective date that preceded the date that the uwc was actually signed 
we determined that the measurement date for these grants should be the date that the final signature was received from the compensation committee members  as evidenced by the receipt of an electronic signature page and supporting electronic date stamping evidence 
these errors did not have a separate financial impact from those included as category adjustments 
in two instances in the summer of involving multiple employees  stock options were granted and subsequently re granted by certain former members of our senior management 
in those cases  grant dates and corresponding exercise prices were modified or adjusted after the initial grant date and price had been communicated to employees or the third party stock plan administrator resulting in re granted options with exercise prices lower than the exercise prices of the original grants 
a similar instance in involved the initial grant of options in connection with the hiring of a senior executive officer 
these re grants were not properly accounted for using variable accounting as required by apb the total financial impact for these errors was  and is included in the category adjustment 
certain former members of our senior management engaged in actions that decreased the likelihood of detecting problematic practices with option granting procedures  including delayed preparation of board minutes  drafting board meeting minutes that did not properly reflect the intentions of the board  omitting exhibits from board minutes and not properly recording grants apparently presented and approved at such board meetings  delaying reporting the activities of the special stock option 
table of contents committee to a quarterly basis instead of reporting at each board meeting as required  re granting and re pricing underwater options without communicating to the board  audit committee or the company s auditors  liberally construing the definition of an active employee for purposes of stock option accounting  and liberally construing materiality with respect to stock option accounting used by the company in preparation of its financial statements 
former company management also delayed or manipulated the documentation of granting actions for options granted to section reporting persons in order to give the appearance of compliance with sec reporting requirements 
deficiencies in authority to grant stock options 
evidence indicates that our former chairman or members of company management on his behalf would approve option grants in excess of  shares to officers and non employees  which would have been beyond the board delegated authority granted to the former chairman  president and chief executive officer in his capacity as sole member of our special stock option committee 
certain former members of company management routinely acted as though they had been delegated the authority to establish grant dates and exercise prices notwithstanding lack of authority under delaware law for non directors to do so 
in april the board determined that it was in the best interest of the company to ratify these past grants and continue to honor any such options that remained outstanding 
hire date grants 
the company s informal policy was to make new employee grants to non section reporting persons with grant dates and exercise prices corresponding to the date that the new employee commenced employment with the company or  in some cases  when the employee moved from part time to full time employment 
although no evidence was found showing that any of these grants were made as of dates other than the relevant employee s start date  the recording of minutes approving these grants was often performed at a date other than that commencement date 
considering the consistency of practice and the lack of any evidence that price seeking manipulative intent was present  the company has determined that no additional compensation expense would be required as a result of these administrative delays 
the same policy was followed for section reporting persons  with the one exception noted above where confusion surrounding the scheduled start date of one senior executive officer and the related inability to timely comply with certain sec reporting requirements appear to have been factors that contributed to this deviation from policy 
accounting errors associated with stock option modifications 
until december  in connection with severance arrangements provided to certain terminated employees  including former officers  certain former members of our senior management extended the vesting period  the exercise period or both  of existing options  often by providing a nominal salary to a terminated employee as part of his or her severance arrangement 
in some cases these modifications were made by company managers without senior executive or board knowledge 
in other cases  options were allowed to continue vesting through extended leaves of absence despite contrary provisions in the terms of the option grants 
because these practices had the effect of modifying the original terms of the stock option grants  the company has determined that we should have recorded compensation expense for certain of these stock option modifications 
we have identified a total of instances where such modifications were made and these errors resulted in an aggregate compensation expense of approximately  which we have included in the category adjustment 
employee stock purchase plan administration deficiencies 
we incorrectly calculated the discount given  and hence the correct purchase price for certain employees making purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
certain former managers also allowed a number of terminated employees to continue to purchase shares in the employee stock purchase plan in violation of irs rules subsequent to their date of termination 
the total financial impact of these errors was approximately  and is included in the category adjustment 
the employee stock purchase plan was discontinued in february for reasons unrelated to the investigation 
stock option grants to non employees 
we also failed to correctly account for certain stock options that we granted to non employees eg  advisors or independent contractors  including sales representatives  with the result that the fair value of those grants was not appropriately recorded as a compensation expense as required by 
table of contents sfas the financial impact of the error related to the accounting for non employee stock option grants was approximately  and is included in the category adjustment 
tax related matters 
as a result of misstatement of the correct grant date for stock options  many options were inappropriately classified as incentive stock options isos 
because they were granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the actual date of grant  these options do not qualify for iso treatment and should have been recorded as non statutory options 
the disqualification of iso classification and the resulting conversion to non qualified tax status results in additional payroll withholding tax obligations by the company on the exercise of these options 
the company has recorded estimated tax liabilities of  including potential penalties for incorrectly reporting and withholding of taxes for the inappropriately classified incentive stock options 
this amount is included in the category adjustment in the above table 
the company intends to pursue a negotiated settlement with the internal revenue service as soon as practicable  and the ultimate liability will be based on that settlement 
in addition  discounted options vesting subsequent to december  may result in nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of section a of the internal revenue code thereby subjecting holders to a penalty tax and potential interest on the value of the options in the period in which they vested or were exercised 
with respect to options exercised  in april the board of directors determined that we will assist certain affected optionees in meeting certain tax liabilities by reimbursing such optionees for the amount of such liabilities they have incurred as a result of the granting errors  however  we have determined that certain persons who were significantly involved in the problematic practices identified in our internal stock option investigation will not be afforded any such assistance 
with respect to unexercised options  the board also determined that we will implement a plan to assist certain affected optionees in meeting their liabilities for the amount of this tax obligation by either adjusting the terms of the original option grant in the case of out of the money options or adjusting the terms of the original option grant and paying the affected employees an amount to compensate such employees for the increase in exercise price in the case of in the money options 
we have determined that certain persons who were significantly involved in the problematic practices identified in our internal stock option investigation will not be afforded any such assistance 
accordingly  we anticipate recording certain expenses associated with such assistance in fiscal year for the periods in which such determinations were made 
we currently anticipate such expenses to be approximately  although the exact amount will depend upon the company s stock price at the time these decisions are implemented 
the company also intends to pursue a negotiated settlement with the internal revenue service relating to this topic as soon as practicable  and the ultimate liability will be based on that settlement 
in addition to liabilities for amounts we may be required to pay to the internal revenue service  the adjustments to outstanding unexercised options that the board plans to make to assist certain affected optionees  as described above  may result in additional charges to future compensation expense relating to those adjusted options 
the amount of such charges will depend on the fair value of the adjusted options at the time of the adjustment as compared to their fair value at the time of their original issuance 
involvement of current management 
as a result of its investigation  the special committee has concluded that there was no involvement in any option approval  processing or modifications  or intentional wrongdoing in any of these errors by our current chief executive officer or our current chief financial officer 
the special committee and the board have further concluded that both our current chief executive officer  mr 
james a 
clishem  and our current chief financial officer  mr 
john k 
penver  have appropriately served and can continue to serve as certifying officers with respect to our financial statements  and the special committee and board have expressed their full confidence in the integrity of mr 
clishem and mr 
penver 
remedial measures we are committed to remediating the problems associated with our past stock option granting practices 
in fact  we had changed and strengthened many of our procedures over option granting prior to discovery of issues with our prior option grants  and the commencement of the independent review in december 
table of contents during  management implemented certain improvements to our control environment as well as to controls over administration of and accounting for our equity compensation awards 
these control improvements  described below  were applied to equity compensation awards between october and december  in january the board discontinued its use of the special stock option committee  a single member committee of the board comprised solely of the company s former chairman  president and chief executive officer  that previously had been granted authority by the board to approve awards of up to  shares to non executive employees 
we adjusted our policies and procedures to express the board s intent that  as a general matter of practice  equity compensation awards are to be approved in actual meetings of the compensation committee or full board of directors that are scheduled in advance 
in connection with these adjustments  we established a policy pursuant to which options will generally be granted quarterly at a meeting of the compensation committee to be held at least four business days after the release of our quarterly earnings 
under this policy  unless unusual circumstances dictate a deviation and the reasons and circumstances are contemporaneously documented  stock based compensation awards are not to be made at unscheduled meetings or by unanimous written consents 
these adjustments also included the discontinuation of the practice of granting options with grant dates as of a new employee s commencement of employment 
we changed the standard terms of our equity compensation awards so that going forward new awards would not be fully exercisable immediately upon issuance and so that vesting would not commence until the date of grant as opposed to date of commencement of employment 
we also adopted a policy that generally requires the attendance of outside legal advisors at compensation committee and board meetings to facilitate the appropriate authorization and documentation of each equity compensation award and meeting minutes in a timely fashion 
we added certain procedures to monitor the accuracy and completeness of stock option granting paperwork  including an independent review by our finance manager prior to the issuance of any paperwork to recipients 
furthermore  the special committee issued a report to our board of directors in april recommending certain additional improvements to our stock option granting procedures 
we adopted their recommendations  which had the effect of further improving our controls related to stock option granting procedures 
the additional control procedures recommended by the special committee and approved by our board included the following designating one or more persons adequately trained in the legal and accounting implications of stock option grants to be responsible for administration and monitoring 
this person shall report to  and such person s work is to be reviewed directly by the company s chief financial officer 
this person will review all proposed grants before they are submitted to the board or compensation committee  review all grants prior to submission to the third party administrator of the company s stock plans  and ensure that the exercise price established for all options is equal to or higher than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date that the grant has occurred 
expressly advise persons implementing our processes for stock based compensation awards that the company s written stock based compensation awards policies and procedures preclude the selection of grant dates or exercise prices with the benefit of hindsight 
our option granting processes will be reviewed no less than annually by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and  to the extent deemed necessary  the board or its appropriate committees  to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we are committed to observing the above remedial measures 
we have adopted written stock based compensation awards policies and procedures that among other things  provide that unscheduled grants should 
table of contents be minimized and only made after full consideration of market timing and other issues associated with any such deviation 
further  the policy calls for the documentation of any such deviation 
because we have concluded that many holders of currently outstanding stock options were not significantly involved in or aware of the problematic practices described above  the board has decided that we should continue to honor currently outstanding options that potentially violated the terms of our stock option plan or delaware law at their issuance 
on april   the board decided that the company would not honor any outstanding options held by persons that the board determined were significantly involved in the problematic practices identified by the investigation and knew or should have known that the practices were contrary to the terms of our stock option plan  delaware law  or proper accounting practices 
on april   the board directed the company s counsel to communicate the company s demand that any such options still outstanding should be treated by any such optionee as cancelled 
all  of such options that were still outstanding as of april  have now expired according to their original terms without any attempted exercises 
on april   the board also decided that the company should seek the return of profits realized upon the exercise of certain options by persons that the board determined were significantly involved in the problematic practices identified in the investigation and knew or should have known that the practices were contrary to our stock option plan  delaware law or proper accounting practices 
on april   the board directed the company s counsel to communicate to such persons the company s demand for the return of such profits  totaling  in the aggregate 
to date  we have collected  of such profits from one of the affected individuals 
demands with respect to several other such persons remain pending 
regulatory matters we voluntarily informed the united states securities and exchange commission sec regarding the formation of the special committee and its investigation into our stock option granting procedures 
we have also agreed to share the results of the special committee s investigation with the sec 
we have received requests for voluntary production of documents from the sec and have delivered such documents to the sec  and we are fully cooperating with the sec 
further sec inquiries may require us to expend significant management time in the future  and could result in civil or criminal actions seeking  among other things  injunctions  fines and other penalties 
we cannot predict how long such inquiries may take or how much time and resources will be required to respond to them  or if any such inquiries will lead to further action by the sec against the company or otherwise expose the company to sanctions  fines or other penalties 
on march  we formally notified the nasdaq global market that we had not timely filed our annual report on form k for the year ended december  with the sec 
therefore we were not in compliance with nasdaq s filing requirement as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c  which requires  among other things  that we timely file all required reports with the sec 
consequently on march   we received a staff determination letter from nasdaq indicating that our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  served as a basis for delisting our common stock from the nasdaq global market at the opening of business on march  unless we requested a hearing in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rules through we requested a hearing that was scheduled for may   which stayed the potential delisting of our securities through the hearing date 
representatives of the company  the special committee and the special committee s legal advisers attended the hearing on may   and we are awaiting the decision of the nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
by filing our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe we have regained compliance with the conditions for the continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
cost of restatement and investigation we have incurred substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services in connection with the special committee s investigation  the preparation of our restated financial statements and 
table of contents related regulatory matters 
we have incurred expenses of approximately million through march  related to these matters 
we expect to continue to incur additional expenses at least through june as we complete regulatory reviews and meet with the sec and irs  and finalize the liabilities with regard to income tax treatment of issues arising from the investigation 
in addition  for potential future legal proceedings related to these matters  we may be obligated to indemnify and advance significant legal expenses to certain current and former officers and directors pursuant to the requirements of delaware law  our indemnification agreements with such current and former officers and directors and separate agreements covering indemnification and advancement of expenses for certain former officers and directors  in each case relating to 
executive level overview we design  manufacture and market efficient  reliable and green power quality solutions and uninterruptible power supply ups systems to enable business continuity in the event of power disturbances 
our solutions provide ride through  or temporary  power for the majority of power disturbances such as voltage sags and surges  and bridge the gap between a utility outage and restoration of power  or the time required to switch to generator power 
our products are designed to be environmentally friendly compared to existing solutions without compromising functionality  efficiency or cost 
we have shipped over  flywheels or more than megawatts of our products to businesses in over countries since we were founded in our patented flywheel energy storage systems store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods until utility power is fully restored or a backup electricity generator starts and takes over generating longer term power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we believe that our flywheel products provide many advantages over traditional battery based systems  including substantial space savings  higher power densities  green energy storage and power efficiencies as high as that reduce total operating costs 
we offer our flywheel products with load capabilities from kva to kva  while typically targeting power density applications above kva since the majority of these customers already have back up generators 
we market our flywheel products under the brand name cleansource 
cleansource dc is a non chemical replacement for lead acid batteries used for bridging power 
utilizing our flywheel energy storage technology  the cleansource dc is a stand alone  direct current dc product that is compatible with all major brands of uninterruptible power supplies ups 
we built on the technological success of cleansource dc by creating a battery free ups  cleansource ups  which integrates the ups electronics and our flywheel energy storage system into one compact cabinet 
cleansource ups represents the majority of our current revenue 
the cleansource ups is also marketed by caterpillar inc under the brand name cat ups 
combining our cleansource ups with a generator provides customers with complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance 
we sell our cleansource flywheel products to commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets  including manufacturing  technology  communications  utilities  healthcare  banking and military and in all major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america and europe 
to address the requirements of customers without backup generators that require protection from utility disturbances  we have also developed a patented extended runtime product that we call coolair tm dc 
we initially have targeted coolair dc at lower power levels than our flywheel products  and it is sold as a minute for minute replacement for lead acid batteries 
coolair dc can provide backup power for several minutes to hours depending on the customer application 
coolair dc utilizes mature thermal and compressed air storage tacas technologies combined in a proprietary manner to produce backup power during an electrical disturbance 
this product discharges cool air as a by product of its operation that also can be used by customers during an electrical disturbance as a source of backup cooling 
in addition to offering a dc only solution  when customers desire a complete backup solution with an extended runtime  we have introduced the coolair ups that couples our coolair dc product with a third party double conversion ups 
coolair initially is being targeted at small to medium sized data center customers in north america following its commercial introduction in the us in the second quarter of  and an international version in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents our primary sales channels in north america have traditionally been through our oem partners  caterpillar  inc and eaton electrical formerly known as powerware 
since we have developed additional sales channels in north america including direct sales employees and a network of manufacturer s representatives 
direct sales tend to improve our relationships with clients  improve our gross margins and add service and other revenue opportunities 
our primary sales channels in europe  middle east and asia emea include selling directly to end users and indirectly through select value added resellers vars 
we also provide services including engineering  installation  start up  monitoring  and repair for our products under contracts with our customers 
caterpillar remains our largest oem partner and our largest customer  representing  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during and into  in an effort to expand the territories in which we sell our active power branded products  we began to increase our direct sales organization  particularly in emea 
we saw revenues in emea increase by in as a result of these efforts and we anticipate higher sales levels from this region in we also intend to begin selling directly in the asia pacific region during as we continue the geographic expansion of our direct selling capabilities 
sales of active power branded products through our direct sales and manufacturers representative channels were  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total revenue in increased from due to an increasing market acceptance of our flywheel based products  especially our megawatt class ups product line and our kva product line 
we achieved strong growth in both of our primary markets  north america and emea 
we believe revenues will continue to grow in from new product sales  in particular the megawatt class ups  and from additional variations of our megawatt class products that we intend to sell in to industrial manufacturers and it customers globally 
we believe that the investments we made during and in our sales organization to increase our level of direct sales staff  particularly in europe and northern africa will contribute to improved sales results in from this region 
we will expand our north american sales force in as we increase our direct capabilities in this region 
we were able to improve our gross profit and for the first time in the company s history accomplished a positive gross profit for the full year 
our gross profit margin of was an improvement from the we achieved in and the in this improvement was due primarily to higher sales volumes  higher direct sales  and higher pricing of our sales 
direct sales typically generate higher margins for us than sales that are made through our distribution channels 
we were able to reduce our operating losses by million or after having reduced them in from this is primarily due to settling our outstanding litigation in the fourth quarter of which resulted in gross proceeds of million  and from lower development expenses in  as well as our efforts at cost management during the year 
this included a reduction in our workforce in the third quarter 
these savings were offset by higher sales and marketing expenses due to the increase in our sales organization  and by million of non cash stock based compensation expense which we began recording as an expense in excluding the impact of this stock based compensation  our operating losses were lower than the level 
net cash used in operations increased by million despite the lower operating losses  primarily due to the investments that we made in inventory for our coolair product family and higher finished goods  which saw our inventory increase by million  and due to higher levels of receivables as a result of our higher sales activity that resulted in year end receivables increasing by million 
we have a history of operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our new product developments  combined with our focus on direct sales and solution selling to customers will help us to reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
however we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several quarters 
this will continue to consume 
table of contents our cash and investments 
our total cash and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  we believe that our cash and investments are sufficient to meet our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more  and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
accrued warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is 
table of contents within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition in general  revenue for product sales is recognized when title has transferred to the customer as stipulated by the delivery terms in a sales contract 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition we require persuasive written evidence of the arrangement  a fixed or determinable price  and a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also offer various services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  which may include on site services or installation and integration services 
such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
revenue for services is recognized at the time services are provided 
when products and services are contracted under a single arrangement  we allocate the total sales price to the multiple deliverables based on their relative fair values 
the fair value of our equipment is based on our average historical selling prices  while the fair value of services is based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions or based on the market price an independent third party would charge to provide these services 
revenue associated with the sale of extended warranties is recognized ratably over the contract period 
stock based compensation beginning in we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for our stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
through  we accounted for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma income and per share data as if a fair value method had been used to account for stock based compensation 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our cleansource power quality products  comprising both ups and dc product lines  and sales of continuous power systems cps which are comprised of our ups systems  some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear 
beginning in  product revenue also includes sales of our coolair dc product and coolair ups products 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change product revenue represented of total revenue in both and the increase in product revenue from was due to higher sales of our kva and our megawatt class ups product lines which collectively saw sales increase by million from this was offset by a decrease in sales of our cleansource dc products and our lower power kva products 
we increased our average sales price per flywheel by to thousand in from thousand in due to price increases and due to proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
we expect this trend to continue 
a single product  depending on it power rating  may be comprised of multiple flywheel product units 
in we sold flywheel product units  a increase over the units that we sold in this includes a significantly higher number of our megawatt class systems where we sold wheels in  up from in we continued to expand the territories in which we sold our active power branded products in as we increased our direct sales organization  particularly in europe and northern africa 
we opened new offices in algeria  germany and the uk during the year as part of this effort 
we anticipate higher revenues from these locations in as a result 
caterpillar represented of our revenues in as compared to of our revenue in and remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in  however this increase was smaller than the increase in our direct business  which is why they now represent a smaller part of our total revenue 
we expect further growth in sales to caterpillar in as they enjoy success with their large engine generators  particularly in the megawatt and larger power applications 
we also have seen and anticipate a further increase in capital spending in datacenters where there is a requirement for higher density power solutions such as flywheels  and believe that this will drive higher product revenue levels for us in in  we began to offer our new coolair dc product for commercial sale although the results were not significant 
we do not yet know the adoption rate for this new technology  and as a result we do not anticipate this product to become a significant portion of our revenues during  likely less than of total revenues 
if our sales of this product fail to meet our expectations  we may be required to incur a charge to reserve excess inventory specific to this product which may materially impact our operating results 

table of contents service and spares revenue service and spares revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and spares revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
we anticipate that service and spares revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
where sales are made through an oem channel  our oem partner would typically provide these services to their end user customers 
thus  increasing direct sales gives us a greater opportunity to grow our service and spares revenues 
we plan to aggressively target this revenue stream for growth in cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products or ancillary equipment that are sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations including costs from having underutilized facilities  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase in cost of product revenues in reflects the higher unit volume of sales and production that we experienced 
the increase in cost of product revenue mirrors the increase in product revenues that we experienced in also included in cost of product revenues in was  of stock based compensation 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sold 
was the first year that we have achieved a positive gross margin for the company 
as our direct sales increase  this will lead to improved product margins 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility that has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements  and we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less 
table of contents overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  to reduce our absolute level of spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue and we anticipate further cost reductions in as we reduce our manufacturing space and make further cost reductions 
these benefits have been mitigated during by higher raw material and commodity price increases  but have allowed us to maintain prices despite the higher incoming costs of materials 
cost of service and spares revenue cost of service and spares revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts to customers  as well as the labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and spares revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase of in the cost of service and spares revenue in reflects the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we have added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
this increase in costs compares to the increase in service and spares revenue that we achieved in balancing our labor requirements to our customer needs will continue to be a business challenge for our service organization in as we seek to ensure that we do not incur additional fixed labor costs in advance of anticipated service revenues 
maintaining the efficient utilization of our service labor will be key to profitably growing this area of our business 
many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work is resulting in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 
we expect this trend to continue in research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our research and development efforts in were largely focused on the completion and commercialization of our coolair dc product  and enhancements to our megawatt class ups products 
the decrease in spending compared to is a result of significantly lower prototype expenses with the coolair development as it neared production  and from lower salary expenses following a reduction in headcount that we made in the third quarter of this decrease was offset by approximately  of stock based compensation that we began recording as an expense in the expense included a  technology 
table of contents impairment charge that we incurred in the fourth quarter of related to certain technology license agreements that we entered into in and we had decided not to commercially pursue the underlying technology  but instead plan to focus our development efforts on our existing flywheel and coolair product families 
we believe that research and development expenses will remain at current levels in  and that the spending will be focused on enhancements and cost reductions to our flywheel products  and continued improvements to the coolair products 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses primarily comprise compensation and related costs for selling and marketing personnel  and related travel  selling and marketing expenses  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in selling and marketing expenses in reflects the higher headcount and related costs as we have expanded our direct sales force in emea and opened new offices in the uk and germany 
we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately  of stock based compensation 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in as we expand our direct sales force into new geographies and due to higher variable compensation as our revenues increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  taxes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to million of stock based compensation expense that we began recording in  and from  of higher legal fees in connection with the greenwich litigation 
these increases were offset by a decrease in the change in our allowance for doubtful accounts expense of million compared to  and lower salaries due to lower headcount 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase in because of the higher professional and legal fees as a result of the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and other potential regulatory reviews  and as we meet the income and other tax obligations for certain affected employees that resulted from our historical stock option granting practices 
litigation settlement expense in november we reached a settlement of the litigation with greenwich insurance company whereby greenwich agreed to pay us million in exchange for a full settlement of this case 
accordingly  after 
table of contents million was paid to the company s former chairman and ceo  pursuant to the reimbursement agreement  the company received gross proceeds of million 
interest income the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that the company had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves 
we also altered our investment strategy to move more investments into short term instruments rather than longer term investments  to take advantage of the rising interest rate environment 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities  however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
change in market value of additional investment rights in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we offered these investors additional investor rights to purchase a further  shares of common stock at the price for a limited period of time 
in accordance with the requirements of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we established the fair value of the additional investment rights at the time of the offering based on the proceeds of the offering and the relative fair values of the securities and the additional investment rights 
we used the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of the additional investment rights  and accordingly  attributed a value of  to the additional investment rights which was recorded as paid in capital 
changes in the value of the additional investment rights subsequent to the date of issuance due to fluctuations in the market value of our common stock were required to be reflected in our earnings and we revalued these rights at each reporting date 
the additional investment rights expired unexercised in the third quarter of  and as a result  we recorded a gain of  to our earnings 
comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented of total revenue in both and the increase in product revenue from was due to higher sales of our dc and megawatt class ups product lines and from a higher average sales price per flywheel  due to proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer 
table of contents channel discounts on our direct sales 
the average selling price in was  per quarter megawatt flywheel  compared to  in a single product  depending on it power rating  may be comprised of multiple flywheel product units 
in we sold flywheel product units compared to in  a increase 
this includes a significantly higher number of dc wheels compared to that typically sell at lower average selling prices than our ups wheels 
our cps revenue declined by in compared to and as a percent of product revenue decreased to in from in cps revenue is typically tied to high power system sales and tend to be larger in amount and more infrequent  with a longer sales cycle 
the frequency and timing of such revenues is more volatile and can result in material changes in period to period revenue based upon when revenue is recognized 
we continued to expand the territories in which we sold our active power branded products in as we increased our direct sales organization  particularly in europe and northern africa 
caterpillar represented of our revenue in and was our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
we increased sales to caterpillar in that compliment their large engine generators 
service and spares revenue the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our revenue in was also helped by our oem partners increasing their spare parts inventory levels to better service their end user customers 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenues was unchanged between and  despite a increase in the level of product revenues 
this resulted in our gross margin improving by percentage points to for the year 
we were gross margin positive for the last three quarters of we were able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sold 
this is particularly true for products that we sold directly  rather than through a distribution channel 
as our direct sales increase  this will lead to improved product margins 
in we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the cps and ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we also improved the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility that has a large portion of fixed costs 
during  we incurred approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements  and we expensed the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we produced more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency was driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also had ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
these efforts helped reduce our cost of product revenue 
these benefits were mitigated during by higher raw material and commodity price increases  but allowed us to maintain prices despite the higher incoming costs of materials 
cost of service and spares revenue the cost of service and spares revenue decreased by from at the same time that related revenues increased by 
this decrease in cost of service and spares revenue was primarily due to higher selling prices for spare parts  as well as more efficient utilization of our service labor as our installed base of customers has grown 
many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work resulted in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 

table of contents research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on the development of our new coolair dc product that is based on our thermal and compressed air technology platform  the paralleling of our megawatt class ups product  and our ongoing sustaining activities to help lower product costs on our existing products 
the increase in spending compared to was largely attributable to a  technology impairment charge that we incurred in the fourth quarter of this charge relates to certain technology and license agreements that we entered into in and we decided not to commercially pursue the underlying technology  but instead plan to focus our development efforts on our coolair product family 
we also spent more on prototype materials in as we continued development of the coolair dc product 
selling and marketing our sales and marketing activities in were geared towards development of our direct sales channel  and increased marketing activities to develop the active power brand  and launch of the paralleled megawatt class ups products 
the increase in spending compared to was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel in the us and emea markets  and related personnel costs including travel and the costs of opening new sales offices in the emea marketplace 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of million that we made in the fourth quarter of because of collection difficulties with a foreign customer 
we were able to offset these higher costs by lowering other administrative expenses in compared to  particularly with regard to compliance costs of the sarbanes oxley act  insurance expenses  and legal fees related to the magnex lawsuit 
interest income the increase in interest income from to was primarily attributable to rising interest rates in the us over the preceding months 
we also altered our investment strategy to move more investments into short term instruments rather than longer term investments  to take advantage of the rising interest rate environment 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts will offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities  however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we had established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
change in market value of additional investment rights in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to certain qualified investors at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we offered these investors additional investor rights to purchase a further  shares of common stock at the price for a limited period of time 
in accordance with the requirements of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we established the fair value of the additional investment rights at the time of the offering based on 
table of contents the proceeds of the offering and the relative fair values of the securities and the additional investment rights 
we used the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of the additional investment rights  and accordingly  attributed a value of  to the additional investment rights which was recorded as paid in capital 
changes in the value of the additional investment rights subsequent to the date of issuance due to fluctuations in the market value of our common stock were required to be reflected in our earnings and we revalued these rights at each reporting date 
the additional investment rights expired unexercised in the third quarter of  and as a result  we recorded a gain of  to our earnings 
liquidity and capital resources we ended with million of cash and investments on hand  compared to million at december  we have funded our business to date through collections of revenues generated by the business and through private and public offerings of our stock  including our initial public offering in that resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
we have also received development funding from caterpillar of million since that we have used to fund certain product development relating to our ups products 
although we believe that our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the middle of  based upon our historical and projected cash burn it is likely that the company will need to raise additional funds before the end of  either through future equity or debt offerings  in order to continue to fund and grow its business beyond that date and to ensure that we have adequate cash reserves 
in august of we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission that would have provided for the sale of up to million of equity or debt instruments 
due to the failure to file our annual report on form k in a timely fashion  we are no longer eligible to use our shelf registration statement 
this will influence the type and amount of any future capital raisings that the company may complete 
at this point  the company has made no determination as to the amount  timing or type of any future capital raising that it will undertake  but we have had ongoing discussions with a number of investment banking organizations to explore various capital raising options 
the company also is evaluating proposals to establish a bank revolving line of credit or other debt facilities to provide additional liquidity to assist in managing its working capital 
significant uses of cash we used million of cash in funding our operating activities during this was  or higher than the million that we consumed in the benefits of the litigation proceeds of million were primarily offset by higher amounts of cash used in working capital  with our inventory and receivables increasing by million compared to the prior year 
the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in inventories was due to the initial investments we made in sourcing inventory for the coolair product family  and from holding higher levels of finished goods to support our higher revenue levels 
collectively our inventories increased by million from and we will be working to reduce the level of our inventory during receivables have increased in line with higher quarterly revenues  and increased by million or from this compares to the growth in fourth quarter revenues of from fourth quarter revenues of these increases in inventory and receivables have been reduced by and partially financed by somewhat higher trade payables and accrued liabilities 

table of contents cash provided from investing activities was million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in this difference is largely due to the timing of purchases and sales of short and long term investments that we hold  and that we redeem periodically to finance our operations 
our purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in this increase was due to the investments that we are making in infrastructure as we expand our direct sales presence  and provide demonstration equipment and showrooms in foreign locations  and from investments made to facilitate the development of paralleled megawatt class ups products and new variations of our megawatt class products that we intend to bring to market in cash provided from financing activities was million in compared to million in the proceeds in were primarily from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from our discontinued employee stock purchase program 
in we received million net proceeds from the private placement of shares of common stock 
future uses of cash in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands and thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations we expect the level of capital investments to decrease in from due to the absence of manufacturing related investments that we will need to make and because we are planning to open fewer international offices in we anticipate significant legal  professional and other expenses in as a result of our investigation of historical stock granting procedures  including potentially significant expenses for tax obligations for certain affected employees  and possible indemnification of costs to certain former directors and officers of the company in the event of further legal or regulatory proceedings 
beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
other factors that may affect liquidity we currently offer our coolair customers different ways to purchase the product 
they may purchase the machine outright at the time of sale  or alternatively may choose to use a usage program whereby they pay a fixed periodic fee over a specified contract period of time for a dc solution  and we provide the equipment and all related services 
we believe that this usage program will accelerate the adoption of the coolair products as well as provide future guaranteed income streams from long term usage agreements 
this could have a material financial impact upon our business if we have to fund the capital cost of this equipment from our existing capital resources 
we believe that we can obtain third party financing or even sell the usage income streams to third 
table of contents party financial institutions if we desire and to mitigate the cost  although to date we have not entered into any agreements to do so 
our experience to date suggests that up to one half of our coolair customers may take advantage of our usage programs 
prior years our principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million of cash and investments compared to million at december  the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in cash used in was largely attributable to lower operating losses in due to the absence of litigation related expenses  and from the absence of litigation related payments that we made in this was offset by settlement amounts paid for multi year sales tax audits during our working capital did not change significantly from receivables increased in line with higher quarterly revenues and inventories have increased by  driven by higher sales levels 
these increases in working capital were reduced by and financed by higher trade payables and accrued liabilities 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million that was provided from investing activities in this difference is largely due to the timing of purchases and sales of short and long term investments that we hold  and that we redeem periodically to finance our operations 
our purchases of property and equipment increased from  in to million in this increase was due to the investments that we are making in equipment and infrastructure as we prepared to begin commercial production of the coolair product family  and from investments made to facilitate the development of paralleled megawatt class ups products 
cash provided from financing activities was million in compared to  in the difference is due to the million net proceeds we received in february from the private placement of shares of common stock 
we also received funds from the proceeds of employee stock options and proceeds from our employee share purchase program 
new accounting pronouncements in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements

the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
we estimate that a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by  because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on their fair value 
our international sales have historically been made in us dollars 
as the company increases sales in foreign markets  it is making more sales that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro 
those sales in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have been minimal to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies 
however  we may engage in hedging activities in the future 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
