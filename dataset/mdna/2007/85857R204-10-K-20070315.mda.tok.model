see risk factors under item a above 
overview since our inception in  we have been primarily engaged in research and development of human therapeutic products 
since the second half of  our sole focus has been on our stem cell technology 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of our human neural stem cells as a treatment for infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  a fatal neurodegenerative disease often referred to as batten disease 
the trial is being conducted at oregon health science university s doernbecher children s hospital in portland  oregon 
we have not derived any revenues from the sale of any products apart from license revenue for the research use of certain of our patented cells and media  and we do not expect to receive revenues from product sales for at least several years 
we have not commercialized any product and in order to do so we must  among other things  substantially increase our research and development expenditures as research and product development efforts accelerate and clinical trials are initiated 
we had expenditures for screening and enrolling patients and for preparing hucns sc doses for our phase i clinical trial and will incur more such expenditures for any future clinical trials 
we previously had expenditures for toxicology and other studies in preparation for submitting the investigational new drug application ind for our phase i trial for ncl to the fda and getting it cleared by the fda  and will incur more such expenditures for any future inds 
we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
as a result  we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenues from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
there are no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenues will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
significant events of the past year include these in november   the first patient in our phase i clinical trial was transplanted with our proprietary human neural stem cell product hucns sc tm at oregon health science university s ohsu doernbecher children s hospital 
since then  a second patient has also been transplanted with hucns sc at ohsu 
this study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of hucns sc as a treatment for infantile and late infantile ncl also known as batten disease  and a total of six patients are planned to be enrolled 

table of contents in april   we sold  shares of common stock to a limited number of institutional investors at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
we received total proceeds  net of offering expenses and placement agency fees  of approximately million 
in june and february  we received a combined total of approximately million additional shares of reneuron group plc  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions of the license agreement entered into with reneuron in july as they applied to two reneuron financings 
in february  we sold approximately  shares of reneuron for net proceeds of approximately million 
as of february   we owned approximately million shares of reneuron 
see note and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in  the us patent and trademark office issued seven new patents that are owned by or exclusively licensed to stemcells  inc  further strengthening what the company believes is the dominant intellectual property position in the neural stem cell field  with claims covering methods for identification  isolation  expansion  and transplantation of neural stem cells as well as methods for drug discovery and testing 
see patents  proprietary rights and licenses 
in august   we licensed certain rights to our intellectual property to stem cell therapeutics corp  a canadian biotechnology company engaged in treating certain central nervous system disorders by stimulating endogenous neural stem cells 
under the agreement  we received an up front fee and will receive license maintenance fees  as well as milestone and royalty payments 
see license agreements under patents  proprietary rights and licenses 
our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our facilities in rhode island and the increasing costs associated with our facility in california 
to expand and provide high quality systems and support to our research and development programs  as well as to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting  we will need to hire more personnel  which will lead to higher operating expenses 
throughout and early  we made a number of additions to our management team in january  maria millan  md  facs  joined us as director  liver cell transplant program  in december  she was promoted to vice president and head of the liver program 
in april  elizabeth leininger  phd was appointed vice president  regulatory affairs and quality assurance 
in december  ann tsukamoto  phd  formerly vice president  research and development  was promoted to the newly created position of chief operating officer  and rodney young was promoted to chief financial officer and vice president  finance and administration 
in january   stephen huhn  md  md  md  joined us as vice president and head of the neural program 
our neural program ranges from the preclinical stage  in which we test human neural stem cells in small animal models of human diseases  both in house and through external academic collaborators  through the development phase  in which we evaluate improvements to expansion methods and the toxicology of the cells  through the clinical development phase  with respect to the phase i clinical trial in ncl mentioned above 
in our liver program  we are engaged in evaluating our proprietary liver engrafting cell in various in vivo assays  and are planning to advance our liver stem cell program into product development as rapidly as we can 
our pancreas program is still in the discovery stage and further evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the candidate human pancreatic stem progenitor cell will be required 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
table of contents the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include the following accrued wind down expenses see note 
the grant date fair value of share based awards recognized as compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r 
see stock based compensation below 
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets see note 
marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company has classified the company s short term investments as available for sale marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the marketable securities are stated at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
management reviews securities with unrealized losses for other than temporary impairment 
a decline in the fair value of securities that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings when so deemed 
see note stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  or to non employee directors as compensation for service on the board of directors  to be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair values of such payments 
we maintain shareholder approved stock based compensation plans  pursuant to which we granted stock based compensation to our employees  and to non employee directors for board service 
these grants are primarily in the form of options that allow a grantee to purchase a fixed number of shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares at the date of the grant qualified stock option grants 
the options may vest on a single date or in tranches over a period of time  but normally they do not vest unless the grantee is still employed by or a director of the company on the vesting date 
the compensation expense for these grants will be recognized over the requisite service period which is typically the period over which the stock based compensation awards vest 
we made no modifications to outstanding options with respect to vesting periods or exercise prices prior to adopting sfas r 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas r 
we applied the principles of sab in conjunction with its adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense will be recognized based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r for all new grants effective january   and for options granted prior to but not vested as of december  prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard and therefore do not include fair value compensation expense related to stock option grants for those periods 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognized stock option related compensation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  stock option related compensation expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each grant net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimated forfeiture rates based on our historical experience within separate groups of employees 
the estimated fair value of the options granted during and prior years was calculated using a black scholes merton option pricing model 
table of contents black scholes model 
the following summarizes the assumptions used in the black scholes model as applied by quarter for the year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield expected term years until exercise the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock factoring in daily share price observations 
in computing expected volatility  the length of the historical period used is equal to the length of the expected term of the option 
no cash dividends have been declared on the company s common stock since the company s inception  and the company currently does not anticipate paying cash dividends over the expected term of the option 
the expected term is equal to the average of the contractual life of the stock option and its vesting period 
at december   approximately  of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
the resulting effect on net loss and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders may not be representative of the effects in future periods  due to changes in forfeiture rates  additional grants and subsequent periods of vesting 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with apb  we generally recognized no compensation expense for qualified stock option grants  as the options were usually granted at fair market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant 
for options issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant  we recognized the difference between the exercise price and fair market value as compensation expense in accordance with apb prior to january   we provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  sfas as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas 
as fair value compensation expense was disclosed but not recognized in periods prior to january   no cumulative adjustment for forfeitures was recorded in see table in stock based compensation under note below for an illustration of the effect on net loss and net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation in the prior years ended december  and we account for stock options granted to non employees in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and accordingly  recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such options as calculated using the black scholes model 
the fair value is re measured at each reporting date during the service period and is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
no stock options were issued to non employees during the year ended december   other than options granted to non employee members of the board of directors for service as board members 
in july  pursuant to the equity incentive plan  we granted cash settled stock appreciation rights sars to certain employees 
the sars give the holder the right  upon exercise  to the difference between the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the sar 
the exercise price of the sars is equal to the market price of our common shares at the date of grant 
the sars will vest on the same schedule as our qualified options issued to employees  ie  on the first anniversary of the grant date and then th every month thereafter 
we will recognize compensation expense for the sars over the requisite service period which is typically the period over which the awards vest 
since the vesting schedule of the sars is identical 
table of contents to the vesting schedule of options granted this period  our fair value calculation of the sars issued using the black scholes model were based on the same assumptions used in calculating compensation expense for stock options granted this period 
the fair value of the share based compensation liability for the cost of the requisite service that has been rendered at the reporting date is re measured at each reporting date through the date of settlement 
the following table presents the activity of the company s sars awards for the year ended december  and weighted average weighted average sars exercise price sars exercise price outstanding at january granted exercised canceled outstanding at september sars exercisable at december for the year ended december   we recorded approximately  as compensation expense related to sars granted 
at december   approximately  of unrecognized compensation expense related to sars is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
the resulting effect on net loss and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is not likely to be representative of the effects in future periods  due to changes in the fair value calculation which is dependent on the stock price  volatility  interest and forfeiture rates  additional grants and subsequent periods of vesting 
long lived assets we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
if an impairment exists  the charge to operations is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
wind down and exit costs in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our remaining research and development activities and corporate headquarters  to california  in october  we have provided our estimate of the exit cost obligation in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate such estimate

we required a high level of external services in for preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies and other external services in preparation for submitting our first ind to the fda 
the decrease in expenses related to external services was also attributable to a decrease in valuation in of stock options granted as compensation to non employees as compared to the valuation in the valuation computed by the black scholes method is dependant on variable factors at the time of such valuation such as stock price  stock price volatility  interest rate and remaining life of the option

wind down expenses in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our remaining research and development activities and corporate headquarters  to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through to the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking account of changes  if any  in each underlying 
table of contents factor 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections over time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the leasehold to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility for years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be for  and approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
if the assumed vacancy rate for to the end of the lease had been five percentage points higher or lower at december   then the reserve would have increased or decreased by approximately  similarly  a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  and a increase or decrease in the assumed average rental charge per square foot would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
the wind down reserve at the end of december  was  for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve to  by recording an additional  for the year ended december  see note for a breakdown of these figures by quarter

in and we had undertaken direct financing transactions with the state of rhode island and received proceeds from the issuance of industrial revenue bonds totaling  to finance the construction of a pilot manufacturing facility and a related cell processing facility 
the related leases are structured such that lease payments will fully fund all semiannual interest payments and annual principal payments through maturity in august for these related facilities we expect to pay approximately  in principal  interest and related expenses in  before receipt of sub tenant income 
we have subleased the pilot manufacturing facility and the cell processing facility  as well as approximately one fourth of the saf
