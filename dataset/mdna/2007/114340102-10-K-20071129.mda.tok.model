overview we are a leading supplier of technology products and solutions primarily serving the worldwide semiconductor market 
we principally supply hardware and services to both original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who make semiconductor device manufacturing equipment  and chip manufacturers 
we are a technology and market leader with offerings ranging from individual hardware modules to fully integrated systems as well as services to install and support our products worldwide 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made changes to our internal reporting structure and will now be reporting results in three segments automation systems group  critical components group and global customer support group 
our automation systems group segment provides a range of wafer handling products and systems that support both atmospheric and vacuum process technology used by our customers 
our critical components group segment includes cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement products used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
our global customer support group segment provides an extensive range of support to our customers to address their on site needs  consultation  or spare parts logistics  all of which enable the customer to maximize wafer fab utilization  process tool uptime and productivity 
certain reclassifications have been made in the and consolidated financial statements to conform to the presentation 
in fiscal  our total revenues increased to million from the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the additional revenues related to our acquisition of synetics solutions inc  along with higher industry demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal our revenue by segment for fiscal and is as follows in thousands for the year ended september  automation systems group critical components group global customer support group our automation systems group segment revenues increased from the prior year to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the additional revenues related to our synetics acquisition along with higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment during fiscal year our critical components group segment revenues increased from the prior year to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher demand for our cryogenic technology products 
our global customer support group segment increased from the prior year to million primarily due to a higher level of repair revenues 
we expect fiscal revenues to decrease from due to a softening of demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
gross margins decreased to for fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the lower gross margins on the additional synetics revenues 
we expect our gross margins to remain relatively stable in the near term  as the company has several cost reduction initiatives underway to improve gross margins  along with higher margins from new product introductions  offset by lower manufacturing cost absorption on lower revenues 

table of contents we recorded income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal this improvement is largely the result of higher revenue and gross margin dollars  and lower interest expense 
we generated million of cash from operations in fiscal year  compared to a cash flow from operations of million in fiscal at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating to million 
recent developments on march   we completed the sale of our software division  brooks software  to applied materials  inc  a delaware corporation applied for cash consideration and the assumption of certain liabilities related to brooks software 
brooks software provided real time applications for greater efficiency and productivity in collaborative  complex manufacturing environments 
we transferred to applied substantially all of its assets primarily related to brooks software  including the stock of several subsidiaries engaged only in the business of brooks software  and applied assumed certain liabilities related to brooks software 
the sale was consummated pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of november  by and between the company and applied 
applied is among our largest customers for tool automation products 
following a bidding process in which multiple possible purchasers participated  the purchase price for brooks software was determined by arm s length negotiations between the company and applied 
we sold our software division in order to focus on our core semiconductor related hardware businesses 
we recognized a gain on disposal of the software division 
effective october   our consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to reflect this business as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
on may   we announced that our board of directors the board had authorized a modified dutch auction self tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our approximately million outstanding shares as of april  this transaction closed on july  in the tender offer  shareholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price not less than per share or more than per share  net to the seller in cash  without interest 
the tender offer commenced on june  and expired on june  this action followed the closing of our recent sale of the brooks software division  which generated proceeds to us that strengthened our cash assets 
following the sale of the brooks software division  the board determined that the best use for much of the cash generated in that transaction was to invest in brooks through a share repurchase returning money to our shareholders 
on july   we announced the final results of our modified dutch auction tender offer 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer  we accepted for purchase  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for a total cost of approximately million  which includes million of associated fees 
the total shares tendered before proration was approximately  common shares 
since the offer was oversubscribed  the number of shares that we accepted for purchase from each tendering shareholder was prorated  based upon the proration procedures described in the offer to purchase mailed to shareholders and certain other limited exceptions 
shareholders who validly tendered shares at a price equal to or below per share had approximately of those shares accepted for purchase 
the depositary promptly issued payment for the shares accepted for purchase in the tender 
any shares properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  but not purchased  were returned promptly to stockholders by the depositary 
we financed the tender offer with available cash on hand 
on november  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to buy up to million of our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchase transactions authorized under the plan will occur from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
management and the board of directors will exercise discretion with respect to the timing and amount of any shares repurchased  based on their evaluation of a variety of factors  including current market conditions 
repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
additionally  brooks may initiate repurchases under a rule b plan  which would permit shares to be repurchased when brooks would otherwise be 
table of contents precluded from doing so under insider trading laws 
any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes 
the repurchase program will be funded using the company s available cash resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
in the limited situations where the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repairs is recognized upon shipment  while revenue from upgrades and paid field service is recognized upon acceptance 
intangible assets and goodwill as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting units and measure 
table of contents impairment  if any  as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value of the goodwill 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as required under fas on september of each fiscal year 
during this process estimates of revenue and expense were developed for each of our reporting units and as a whole based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
our analyses indicated no impairment of the goodwill in fiscal  or accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience by customer 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with sfas  management has considered the weight of all available evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance remains to be required against its deferred tax assets at 
table of contents september  we believe that while the recent profitability experienced in and provides some evidence as to the potential for realizability of the deferred tax assets  more extensive and sustained evidence would be required in order to reverse the valuation allowance 
given the loss incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal combined with the near term uncertainty with regard to the outlook of the semiconductor sector as well as the magnitude of the deferred tax assets as at september   the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards  and the extended period of time that would be required to utilize these losses  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
however  it is possible that the more likely than not criterion could be met in fiscal or a future period  which could result in the reversal of a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance  which  at that time  would be principally recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation as of october   the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase

liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oem s that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
in response to these downturns  we have implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount  salary and wage reductions and reduced spending 
the cyclical nature of the industry make estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   an increase of million from september  this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of the software division of million and cash provided by operations of million  partially offset by million for treasury share purchases and the million used for capital additions 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september   and was primarily attributable to our net income of million  adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization of million and compensation expense related to common stock and options of million  partially offset by the gain on sale of the software division of million  a non cash gain on investment of million and changes in our net working capital of million 
the million decrease in working capital was primarily the result of decreased accounts payable levels of million primarily as a result of lower inventory purchases  and decreased accrued expenses of million 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   and is principally comprised of proceeds on the sale of the software division of million  partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used for capital additions 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended september  from the treasury share repurchases of million  partially offset by million due to proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
while we have no significant capital commitments  as we expand our product offerings  we anticipate that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and improve our computer systems infrastructure 
we may also use our resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement our business 
at september   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
our contractual obligations consist of the following at september  in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases continuing operating leases exited facilities purchase commitments total contractual obligations amounts do not reflect approximately  of contractual sublease income 
we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both the short and long term as well as our stock repurchase plan announced on november  however  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we are subject to litigation related to our stock based compensation restatement which could have an adverse affect on our existing resources

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab expressing the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement errors the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it essentially requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
the provisions of sab should be applied to annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  we adopted sab for the fiscal year ended september  and did not realize a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with earlier adoption permitted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through foreign subsidiaries which maintain accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  some of our assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the united stated dollar 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities and our operating results 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments to hedge these exposures
