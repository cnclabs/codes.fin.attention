item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview as a holding company of various product and service entities  we have historically invested in businesses that we believe are undervalued or underperforming  and or in operations that are poised for significant growth 
management s strategic focus is to support the growth of its operations by increasing revenues and revenue streams  managing costs and creating earnings growth 
additionally  we continually seek and evaluate strategic acquisitions that expand core offerings and drive incremental revenue and earnings growth 
our operations are largely decentralized from the corporate office 
autonomy is given to subsidiary entities  and there are few integrated business functions ie sales  marketing  purchasing and human resources 
day to day operating decisions are made by subsidiary management teams 
our corporate management team assists in operational decisions when deemed necessary  selects subsidiary management teams and handles capital allocation among our operations 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in  restructured in and redomesticated to the state of indiana in may prior to  we conducted business mainly in the entertainment industry 
we classify our businesses under five operating segments business solutions  wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies  and electronics integration 
key factors affecting or potentially affecting results of operations and financial condition management considers the following factors  events  trends and uncertainties to be important to understanding its results of operations and financial condition holding company management believes that its diversification among various businesses will improve long term consistency in earnings 
it is our intent to continue to operate in selected market segments that may not directly relate to one another 
management s strategy has been and continues to be to acquire and grow businesses that present consistent long term growth opportunities 
to this extent  over the past five fiscal years  we have completed six key acquisitions furthering our growth strategy 
four of these key acquisitions have been in the peo industry 
in february  the company acquired pem  a peo located in arizona 
in march  the company acquired esg  a peo located in utah and colorado 
the company s acquisition of pem and esg enabled the company to expand its geographic presence in the peo marketplace  and has made the company one of the three largest public peos in the country 
in april  we acquired csm  a peo located in nashville  tennessee 
this acquisition of the oldest peo in the state expanded our business solutions segment service offerings 
in april  we acquired jh drew  a construction installer of highway products and commercial structural steel 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the transportation infrastructure business in the midwestern united states 
in october we acquired psm  a peo located in indianapolis  indiana 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the peo market 
in july we acquired nor cote  a specialty ink manufacturer with worldwide distribution channels 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the ultraviolet ink business 
we continue to pursue peo acquisition opportunities as well as other acquisition opportunities as deemed appropriate 

table of contents there are several key factors that have affected or potentially may affect our results of operations including the following earnings are dependant on a number of factors including our ability to execute operational strategies and integrate acquired companies into our existing operations 
our historical growth has been due to several significant acquisitions over the past five years 
future growth in revenues and earnings may not increase at the same rate as historical growth 
we have current and long term debt liabilities of million 
principal payments of million and estimated interest payments of approximately million are due within months 
the ability to meet financing needs may affect future management strategies 
certain of our expenses  such as wages  benefits and rent  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self funded medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
typically  the first  third and fourth quarter represent the best quarters for our consolidated financial results 
these results are attained due to our investment in the construction industry 
we maintain a solid working relationship with all of our unions and good employee relations are a focus of our management 
although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
a control group  which includes our two major shareholders  owns of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  these persons could have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations  election of directors and any other significant corporate actions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of the company s other shareholders and their stock ownership may thereby limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the management and affairs of the company 
business solutions we continue to expand service offerings in addition to our payroll services  including human resource outsourcing  employment training and testing 
while the majority of customer operations are concentrated in the arizona  colorado  indiana  tennessee and utah markets  we intend to expand service offerings through acquisitions or new offices in the next twelve to twenty four months 
we are in the process of installing a universal software platform among all of our peos 
we believe this universal platform will result in operational efficiencies sand save on audit and compliance fees 
financial results may be affected by changes in the state regulatory environments  results under our partially self funded health and partially self funded workers compensation insurance plans  and economic conditions 
wireless infrastructure we reduced the size and scope of our wireless infrastructure segment during the year ended august  some of these reductions will not become apparent until the year ending august  most of these reductions occurred in our wireless construction and wireless technical services businesses 
we deliberately reduced the size and scope of these businesses due to the large losses incurred by these businesses 
the losses were incurred primarily due to our inability to efficiently match our number of employees with the construction and technical services workload 
we did not receive the anticipated number of jobs and the jobs that we did receive were often delayed or cancelled 
after downsizing our wireless construction business  we transferred control of the remaining business to the transportation infrastructure segment effective july  similarly  after downsizing our wireless technical services business  we transferred control of the remaining business to the transportation infrastructure segment effective november  we made these transfers because the management of our transportation infrastructure segment has substantial expertise in managing construction projects 
we believe this expertise will allow them to exercise better control of the wireless construction and wireless technical services businesses 
businesses remaining with the wireless infrastructure segment are our engineering and site acquisition businesses 
these businesses have performed successfully and we believe they will continue to grow in the future 

table of contents transportation infrastructure financial results continue to fluctuate as a result of federal and state funding for highway safety projects  changes in steel and fuel prices  market conditions and competition 
most of our jobs are competitively bid 
we face the continual challenge of being the lowest and best bidder in order to get the job 
we also face the challenge of not underbidding the job with the result that we lose money on the job or do not attain our desired profit margin 
the loss of even one big job due to us not being the lowest and best bidder can have a substantial impact on our revenues 
we are continuously affected by weather conditions and commodity price fluctuations 
operations within this segment continue to expand beyond strictly highway safety products to commercial steel erection 
although this segment is subject to significant volatility  we expect continued growth 
ultraviolet technologies we expect continued growth in our ultraviolet technologies segment 
future growth is dependent on raw material and product availability and pricing  research and development initiatives  attracting new customers with new products  and our ability to continue to deliver consistent  high quality product 
the increased competition in our domestic and foreign markets requires us to stay price competitive 
we are also affected by our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other technical personnel 
we recently hired a new chemist to assist with some product quality issues 
in his short tenure  he has already made a positive impact 
we are also in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity in singapore 
we see major growth opportunities in china and singapore 
electronics integration we expect continued growth in our electronics integration segment although we had mixed results during our year ended august  commercial solutions  which sells televisions primarily to the healthcare and lodging industries  had positive results 
kingston integration  which sells televisions primarily to integrators  other distributors and large restaurant chains  had a significant decrease in sales 
we have installed a new management team and believe that the results will improve 
avr which installs commercial and residential electronics and home theaters has ended the year with a significant loss 
again  we have installed new management and believe that results will improve 
during the year ending august   we anticipate expanding our distribution business to include non electronic products 
we have developed many contacts in china as a result of trips to china as part of our ultraviolet technologies business 
we believe that we can import various products from china and sell these products using our existing distribution network 
our future financial success will largely be dependent on our ability to maintain preferred pricing with our vendors  availability of products from our vendors  industry consolidation  economic conditions  and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel

guaranties a significant portion of our debt and surety bonds are personally guaranteed by the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
it is very unlikely that the company could have obtained such debt without the personal guarantees 
if the chairman of the board and chief executive officer decide not to continue their personal guarantees or decide not to make additional personal guarantees  it will significantly limit the company s ability to obtain financing and would have a material adverse effect upon the company 
as of august   the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer had personally guaranteed company debt in the amount of million

such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement

if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with the surety  we have posted letters of credit in the amount of million in favor of the surety and  with the consent of our lenders under our credit facility  we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety 
we expect this letter of credit in favor of the surety to be reduced in the future 
to date  we have not been required to make any reimbursements to the surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future

for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this report requires the company s use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported revenue and expense amounts for the periods being reported 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes  valuation of contingent consideration resulting from acquisitions  and valuation of certain liability reserves 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

goodwill and other intangible assets the company has adopted sfas no 
with the adoption of sfas  material goodwill included in the company s wireless infrastructure  business solutions  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies and electronics integration segments was assessed for impairment 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill and other intangible assets valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated or understated 
the company has elected to perform the annual impairment test of recorded goodwill as required by sfas as of the end of fiscal fourth quarter 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units as of august   exceeded the carrying  or book value  including goodwill  and therefore recorded goodwill was not subject to impairment 
in the fiscal year ended august   the company recognized impairment on certain other intangible assets in its wireless infrastructure segment of million and its electronics integration segment of million

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performances and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual segment discounted cash flows to the asset segment carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards

this amount was a release of of the transportation infrastructure segment and of the business solutions segment
