item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operations reported in the consolidated statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended december  consist primarily of the company s proportionate share of the operating results from its interest in cyanco  a non corporate joint venture engaged in the manufacture and sale of liquid sodium cyanide  management fee income from cyanco  investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents  and corporate overhead  costs and expenses 
since the company does not own more than of cyanco  and has determined that other factors requiring consolidation do not exist  the financial statements of cyanco are not consolidated with the financial statements of the company 
summarized financial information for cyanco for the each of the three years in the period ended december  is presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the audited financial statements of cyanco are included as exhibit to this form k 
cyanco historically represented one of three sources of sodium cyanide for use in the mining industry in the western united states 
the world market for briquette or dry form sodium cyanide is dominated by ei dupont nemours dupont 
historically  cyanco competed with dupont and also with fmc corporation fmc  which marketed and delivered liquid sodium cyanide in the same geographic area as cyanco 
effective april   cyanco purchased contracts and certain distribution assets related to fmc s sodium cyanide business 
as a result of this transaction  fmc exited the business  ending its role as a supplier of sodium cyanide to the nevada gold mining industry 
cyanco assumed fmc s on going contractual obligations under its existing sodium cyanide contracts and began supplying these customers in april as a consequence  dupont is presently the sole competitor of cyanco in supplying sodium cyanide to the mining industry in the western united states 
cyanco s business is characterized by reliance on the mining industry  competitive demands  dependence on a relatively small number of customers  fluctuating market prices for energy and raw materials  and increases in the cost of labor 
the company believes that the important competitive factors in the sodium cyanide market are service  quality and price 
cyanco delivers product to its customers pursuant to supply contracts  which vary in length 
cyanco must meet competitive demands in order for its customers to renew product supply contracts as they expire  and has been able to achieve results by being creative and service oriented and offering competitive prices 
all of cyanco s sales occur within the western united states 
since most of cyanco s cyanide customers are large mining companies  the number of companies it services is relatively small 
during  cyanco had sales to two customers representing  and of total sales 
each large mining concern may have multiple operating properties within cyanco s operating region 
a loss of one or more of cyanco s customers could adversely affect future sales  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
such a loss can occur either from the customer switching to another source or from the customer electing to close or suspend a mining operation 
however  such losses of customers due to mine closures are not currently expected to occur  based on existing gold prices 
with higher gold prices  existing gold mining operations tend to expand and new or old mines are opened 
the reverse is true with falling gold prices 
the results of operations for the year ended december  have been negatively impacted by the company accruing and expensing additional amounts related to income tax audits in the united states and in canada  including interest charges and professional fees 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the company s consolidated financial statements and the most critical of such policies are discussed below 
investment in cyanco short term investments accounting for income taxes investment in cyanco as previously discussed  the company does not own more than of cyanco  and as a result  the financial statements of cyanco are not consolidated with the financial statements of the company 
the company accounts for its investment in cyanco using the equity method of accounting 
equity in earnings of cyanco is based on the company s ownership in cyanco and is calculated and recognized at the end of each month 
management fees from cyanco are recognized monthly and are calculated as a percentage of cyanco revenues based on the joint venture agreement 
the determination of useful lives and depreciation and amortization methods utilized by cyanco for its property and equipment and intangible assets are considered critical accounting estimates 
cyanco management uses its judgment to estimate the useful lives of long lived assets  taking into consideration historical experience  engineering estimates  industry information and other factors 
inherent in these estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance will be performed and there will be an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of assets would be shorter 
cyanco reviews its long lived assets  including customer relationships and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
cyanco assesses the recoverability of the long lived assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets against their respective carrying amounts  using assumptions concerning the following factors contract price per pound of product delivered projected number of pounds of product to be delivered projected life of the contract  including reasonable assumptions for renewals beyond the initial contract period projected costs of raw materials projected reductions in cash flows for revenue sharing obligation if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the amount of impairment loss recorded in cyanco s statement of operations is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets  calculated using the discounted cash flows expected during the remaining useful life 
cyanco recorded impairment losses of  in the fourth quarter of and  in the second quarter of see discussion under impairment of long lived assets below 
short term investments the company s current assets at december  were comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents of  investments with scheduled original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents 
investments with scheduled original maturities of greater than three months but not greater than one year are recorded as short term investments 
the company had no short term investments meeting this criterion at december  short term investments are recorded at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in market rates will affect interest earned on these instruments  and potentially the carrying value of the investments 
deferred income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current income tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for income tax and financial accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net amount of which is included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
when appropriate  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 
key assumptions used in estimating a valuation allowance include potential future taxable income  projected income tax rates  expiration dates of foreign and other tax credit carryforwards  anticipated results of tax audits  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as of december   the company had reduced its deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance of  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
certain of the company s united states and canadian income tax returns are currently under audit 
the ultimate outcome of these audits and the impact of the final audit results on the consolidated financial statements of the company cannot be determined at this time 
the company believes that amounts accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  will be adequate for the resolution of the audits 
however  there can be no assurance that such costs will not ultimately exceed the current estimate 
the company reviews the accrued amount at each balance sheet date 
any increase in the accrual or the final resolution of the amount due in excess of the accrual would reduce income in the period such determination is made 
similarly  any decrease in the accrual or final determination that the amount due is less than the accrual would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the company has accrued estimated amounts and has amounts on deposit for the potential outcome of these audits  but there can be no assurance that such costs will not ultimately exceed the current estimate 
consequently  the company s results of operations for any particular period may be affected by these adjustments  unrelated to the results of the current business operations of the company for that period 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the company to measure the compensation cost of stock options and other stock based awards to employees and directors at fair value at the grant date and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the company s current practice is to grant options to members of its board of directors that vest immediately  resulting in reporting the entire compensation expense for the options in the period that they are granted 
during the year ended december   the company reported compensation expense of  for stock options issued to directors in april the fair value of stock options is computed using the black scholes valuation model  which model utilizes inputs that are subject to change over time  and includes assumptions made by the company with respect to the volatility of the market price of the company s common stock  risk free interest rates  requisite service periods  and the assumed life and vesting of stock options and stock based awards 
as new options or stock based awards are granted and vest  additional non cash compensation expense will be recorded by the company 
results of operations vs 
the company s equity in the earnings of cyanco increased  or  to  in compared to  in cyanco revenues increased  or  to  in compared to  in increased market prices of gold have resulted in increased mining activities in the area served by cyanco  resulting in higher volumes of product sold 
cyanco experienced significant increases in raw material costs in the latter part of  that moderated in cyanco does have the ability  under certain of its contracts  to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to its customers and the obligation to pass on decreases 
the lag effect inherent in this process resulted in cyanco realizing a higher price per pound for sodium cyanide sold during the first three months of in addition  new business during that replaced a significant contract that expired december  has generated higher profit margins 
cyanco s costs and expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in operating costs for included an impairment loss of  recorded by cyanco 
the increase in operating costs in the current year resulted primarily from the higher volumes of product sold and the increase in the cost of certain key raw material costs compared to the first nine months of as a result  cyanco s net income before taxes on a basis increased  or  to  in compared to  in management fee income from cyanco increased  or  to  in compared to  in  due to the increase in cyanco s revenues discussed above  upon which the management fee is computed 
investment and other income increased  or  to  in compared to  in this increase is due primarily to more favorable rates realized during the current year and due to a  payment received from cyplus to settle a dispute over sales commissions which was included in other income

there were no similar accrued interest charges recorded in general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in this increase is due to primarily to the non cash  stock based compensation expense of  resulting from the grant of directors stock options in april and to increases in professional fees and other expenses related to income tax audits  the dispute with the company s cyanco joint venture partner  and sarbanes oxley act compliance activities 
vs 
the company s equity in the earnings of cyanco decreased  or  to  in compared to  in the decrease in cyanco s earnings in was attributable to increases in operating costs and expenses  primarily the cost of raw materials  incurred by cyanco and impairment and accelerated amortization of intangible assets 
cyanco revenues increased  or  to  in compared to  in increased market prices of gold resulted in increased mining activities in the area served by cyanco  resulting in higher volumes of product sold 
cyanco also realized a higher price per pound for sodium cyanide sold during cyanco s costs and expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in the increase in operating costs was primarily due to the higher volumes of product sold and the increase in the cost of certain key raw materials compared to cyanco does have the ability  under certain of its contracts  to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to its customers  however  price increases to cyanco s customers often lag the increases in the cost of raw materials by two to four months 
similarly  as the raw material prices decrease  cyanco passes the decreases on to its customers with a two to four month lag 
this lag effect prevented cyanco from increasing its pricing as quickly as the costs of raw materials were increasing  reducing cyanco s profitability in cyanco reported an impairment loss of  in the quarter ended june  the company s share of the impairment loss was 
in addition  cyanco accelerated the amortization of the intangible assets related to a terminated contract so that these assets were fully amortized by the end of the contract on december  as a result  cyanco s net income before taxes on a basis decreased  or  to  during compared to  in management fee income from cyanco increased  or  to  in compared to  in due to the increase in cyanco s revenues discussed above  upon which the management fee is computed 
investment and other income increased  or  to  in compared to  in this increase is due primarily to an increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents during the period and to more favorable rates realized on these balances during the year 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in this increase is due to increases in professional fees and other expenses related to income tax audits  the dispute with the company s cyanco joint venture partner  the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements and amended annual and quarterly reports  and sarbanes oxley act compliance activities 
impairment of long lived assets cyanco did not record any impairment of its long lived assets in cyanco recorded impairment losses of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  due to a significant contract acquired from fmc expiring on december  and not being renewed as previously assumed 
the company s share of the impairment losses reduced the company s equity in earnings of joint venture by  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  cyanco accelerated the amortization of the intangible assets related to the contract so that these assets were fully amortized by the end of the significant contract on december  this resulted in additional amortization expense to cyanco in  resulting in a further reduction in the company s equity in earnings of the joint venture in income taxes the company s corporate income tax returns filed in canada for the years ended december  through are under audit by the canada customs and revenue agency ccra 
this audit has been ongoing for the past six years without final resolution 
the first phase of the audit has been completed  and the company has been assessed additional income taxes and interest based on positions taken by ccra on certain matters that differ from positions taken by the company 
the company  based on consultation with its professional tax advisors in canada  believes that  in most instances  the facts and circumstances support the positions taken by the company  and has filed with ccra formal notices of objection for each year under audit  and the audit has progressed to the appeals level 
the timing of the completion of the appeals process is currently uncertain 
certain of the company s united states corporate income tax returns are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs 
the irs has taken the position that the company owes additional income taxes  penalties and interest where the irs has disagreed with certain tax positions taken by the company 
the company has reviewed the positions taken by the irs and  in the fourth quarter of  paid those taxes for which it believed it was liable 
the company anticipates pursuing the internal appeal process at the irs for those positions taken by the irs with which the company disagrees 
the ultimate outcome of the irs audit and the impact of the final audit results on the consolidated financial statements of the company cannot be determined at this time 
the results of operations for year ended december  have been negatively impacted by the company accruing and expensing additional amounts related to these income tax audits  including interest charges and related professional fees 
as a result  the provision for income taxes reported in the company s consolidated statements of income for is substantially higher than amounts which would be computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes 
the company believes that amounts accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and net amounts included in income tax deposits at december  will be adequate for the resolution of the audits by ccra and the irs 
however  there can be no assurance that such costs will not ultimately exceed the current estimate 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the liabilities of the company consisted of current liabilities of  and deferred income taxes of  current liabilities consisted of trade accounts payable of  dividends payable of  and accrued expenses comprised primarily of accrued income taxes and related interest expense of  these current liabilities compare favorably to total current assets of  at december  current assets were comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents of  the company s current strategy is to invest cash in excess of short term operating needs in highly liquid  variable interest rate investments with maturities of days or less 
the board of directors of the company is currently evaluating alternative uses for the cash of the company  including optimizing short term investment results without exposing the company to high levels of market risk  diversification of the company s business  further investment in cyanco  the payment of dividends to shareholders and other strategies 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  this increase in net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increased equity in earnings of cyanco  as discussed below  increased general and administrative expenses other than stock based compensation  as discussed above  and to payments of income taxes  including  paid in the fourth quarter of in connection with the audits of the company s income tax returns 
because the company accounts for its investment in cyanco using the equity method  equity in earnings of cyanco  a non cash item  is eliminated from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  with cash distributions from cyanco included in cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   consisting of distributions from cyanco 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   consisting of distributions from cyanco of  and the payment of the final notes receivable balance of  from the sale of the company s explosives business in the increase in cyanco distributions in the current year is due to the increased earnings of cyanco as discussed above 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   consisting of the payment of dividends of  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   consisting of the payment of dividends 
the company considers its cash resources sufficient to meet the operating needs of its current level of business for the next twelve months 
the company s operations have not been  and are not expected to be  materially affected by inflation 
forward looking statements within this annual report on form k  including the discussion in this item  there are forward looking statements made in an effort to inform the reader of management s expectation of future events 
these expectations are subject to numerous factors and assumptions  any one of which could have a material effect on future results 
the factors which may impact future operating results include  but are not limited to  the outcome of tax matters with the irs and canadian tax authorities  decisions made by cyanco s customers as to the continuation  suspension  or termination of mining activities in the area served by cyanco  decisions made by cyanco s customers with respect to the use or sourcing of sodium cyanide used in their operations  changes in world supply and demand for commodities  particularly gold  political  environmental  regulatory  economic and financial risks  major changes in technology which could affect the mining industry as a whole or which could affect sodium cyanide specifically  competition  and the continued availability of qualified technical and other professional employees of the company and cyanco 
many of these risks are outside the control of the company  and the actions taken by the company may not be sufficient to avoid the adverse consequences of one or more of the risks 
consequently  the actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the statements made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of the company s cash equivalents bear variable interest rates that are adjusted to market conditions 
changes in market rates will affect interest earned on these instruments  and potentially the carrying value of the investments 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments to offset the exposure to interest rates 
the cash equivalents and short term investments are placed in a variety of products with different institutions 
significant changes in interest rates could have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
assuming that the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december  of  was outstanding during the year  a change in interest rates would result in a change of annual earnings of approximately  the company has no foreign operations and is currently not exposed to material risks from changes in foreign currency
