overview we are global supplier of low pin count standard semiconductor products 
these products have pins or less and include small signal transistors  mosfets  thyristor surge protection devices  transient voltage protection devices  hall sensors  power management products  programmable logic arrays  diodes  recitifiers  bridges  and silicon wafer 
we design  manufacture and market discrete semiconductors focused on diverse end use applications in the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive sectors 
semiconductors  which provide electronic signal amplification and switching functions  are basic building block electronic components that are incorporated into almost every electronic device 
we believe that our product focus provides us with a meaningful competitive advantage relative to broad line semiconductor companies that provide a wider range of semiconductor products 
we are headquartered in westlake village  california  near los angeles 
we have two manufacturing facilities located in shanghai  china  one manufacturing facility located in taipei  taiwan and a wafer fabrication facility in kansas city  missouri  and our sales and marketing and logistical centers are located in taipei  taiwan  shanghai and shenzhen  china  and hong kong 
we also have regional sales offices or representatives in derbyshire  england  toulouse  france  frankfurt  germany  and various cities in the united states 
in  we began to transform our business from the distribution of discrete semiconductors manufactured by others to the design  manufacture and marketing of discrete semiconductor products using our internal manufacturing capabilities 
the key elements of our strategy of transforming our business from a distribution based model to one primarily based on the design and manufacture of proprietary products are expanding our manufacturing capacity  including establishing integrated state of the art packaging and testing facilities in asia  in and  and acquiring a wafer foundry in the united states in expanding our sales and marketing organization in asia in order to address the shift of manufacturing of electronics products from the united states to asia 
establishing our sales and marketing organization in europe commencing in expanding the number of our field application engineers to design our products into specific end user applications 
in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations since  we have experienced increases in the demand for our products  and substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products 
we expect future increases in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix in order to offset reduced average selling prices of our products 
in and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from products introduced within the last three years  which we term new products  compared to in new products generally have gross profit margins that are significantly higher than the margins of our standard products 
we expect net sales derived from new products to increase in absolute terms  although our net sales of new products as a percentage of our net sales will depend on the demand for our standard products  as well as our product mix 
our gross profit margin was in  compared to in and in our gross profit margin decrease in was due to the lower gross margin approximately related to the acquisition of the analog product line 
we will continue to move the analog product to our china manufacturing facilities to increase the gross margin on this product line 
future gross profit margins will depend primarily on our product mix  cost savings  and the demand for our products 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities 
during  we invested approximately million in our asian manufacturing facilities and we expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities  although the amount to be invested will depend on product demand and new product developments 
during  the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was  compared to in and in we expect our net sales to the asian market to continue to increase as a percentage of our total net sales for and beyond as a result of the continuing shift of the manufacture of electronic products from the united states to asia 
we have increased our investment in research and development from million in to million in we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on proprietary semiconductor processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand research and development expenses to approximately of net sales  which will enable us to bring additional proprietary devices to the market 
during  we sold  shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering  raising approximately million net of commissions and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip acquisition and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
on october   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will be convertible into cash or  at our option  cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of per share  in certain circumstances 
in addition  following a make whole fundamental change that occurs prior to october   we will  at our option  increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change  in certain circumstances 
we intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock 
as part of our growth strategy  in december  we announced the acquisition of anachip  a fabless taiwanese semiconductor company focused on analog ics designed for specific applications 
the acquisition  which closed on january   fits in the center of our long term strategy 
anachip s main product focus is power management ics 
the analog devices they produce are used in lcd monitor tvs  wireless lan access points  brushless dc motor fans  portable dvd players  datacom devices  adsl modems  tv satellite set top boxes  and power supplies 
anachip brings a design team with strong capabilities in a range of targeted analog and power management technologies 
this acquisition also shows our disciplined approach to making acquisitions 
we paid million to acquire anachip and the acquisition was accretive to our earnings 
on november   we completed the purchase of the assets of apd semiconductor  a privately held us based fabless semiconductor company 
headquartered in redwood city  california  apd s main product focus is its patented and trademarked super barrier rectifier tm sbr tm technology 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million in addition to a potential earn out provision with respect to pre defined covered products 
revenue generated from apd technologies was approximately  for year for  we project the revenue generated from the apd product line to exceed the purchase price and that the acquisition will be accretive 
the apd acquisition is aligned with our strategy of strengthening our technology leadership in the standard semiconductor market and expanding our product capabilities across important segments of our end markets 
net sales we generate a substantial portion of our net sales through the sale of semiconductor products that are designed and manufactured by third parties or us 
we also generate a portion of our net sales from outsourcing our manufacturing capacity to third parties and from the sale of silicon wafers to manufacturers of discrete semiconductor components 
we serve customers across diversified industries  including the consumer electronics  computing  industrial  communications and automotive markets 
we recognize revenue from product sales when title to and risk of loss of the product have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met upon shipment to our customers 
net sales are stated net of reserves for pricing adjustments  discounts  rebates and returns 
the principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are the condition of the economy in general and of the semiconductor industry in particular  our customers adjustments in their order levels  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  the termination of key supplier relationships  the rate of introduction to  and acceptance of new products by  our customers  our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors  our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers  vendors and strategic alliances  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  a major disruption of our information technology infrastructure  and unforeseen catastrophic events  such as armed conflict  terrorism  fires  typhoons and earthquakes 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our semiconductors and our wafers 
these costs include raw materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the labor costs and overhead expenses 
cost of goods sold is also impacted by yield improvements  capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  cost of goods sold includes the cost of products that we purchase from other manufacturers and sell to our customers 
cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not efficient 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management  sales and marketing  information technology  engineering  human resources  procurement  planning and finance  and sales commissions  as well as outside legal  accounting and consulting expenses  and other operating expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales  marketing and engineering efforts and information technology infrastructure 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects  as well as materials and equipment used for these projects 
research and development expenses are primarily associated with our wafer facility in kansas city  missouri and our manufacturing facilities in china and taiwan  as well as with our engineers in the us all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred  and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new technologies and product lines 
interest income expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest expense consists of interest payable on our outstanding credit facilities and other debt instruments including the convertible bond 
income tax provision our global presence requires us to pay income taxes in a number of jurisdictions 
in general  earnings in the us and taiwan are currently subject to tax rates of and  respectively 
earnings of diodes hong kong are subject to a tax for local sales or local source sales  all other hong kong sales are not subject to foreign income taxes 
earnings at diodes taiwan and diodes hong kong are also subject to us taxes with respect to those earnings that are derived from product manufactured by our china subsidiaries and sold to customers outside of taiwan and hong kong  respectively 
the us tax rate on these earnings is computed as the difference between the foreign effective tax rates and the us tax rate 
in accordance with us tax law  we receive credit against our us federal tax liability for income taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries 
funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries to the us may be subject to federal and state income taxes 
diodes china is located in the songjiang district  where the standard central government tax rate is 
however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the earnings of diodes china were subject to a tax rate by the central government from through  and to a tax rate from through in addition  due to an million permanent re investment of diodes china earnings in  diodes china has re applied to the chinese government for additional preferential tax treatment on earnings that are generated by this million investment 
if approved  those earnings will be exempted from central government income tax for two years  and then subject to a tax rate for the following three years 
in addition  the earnings of diodes china would ordinarily be subject to a standard local government tax rate of 
however  as an incentive for establishing diodes china  the local government waived this tax from through management expects this tax to be waived for  however  the local government can re impose this tax at its discretion at any time 
in  we established our second shanghai based manufacturing facility  diodes shanghai  located in the songjiang export zone of shanghai  china 
in the songjiang export zone  the central government standard tax rate is 
from onward  diodes shanghai earnings might not continue to be subject to the tax rate as a proposed income tax reform is expected to be taking effect in which could terminate some existing tax incentive for foreign enterprise doing business in china 
there is no local government tax 
during  diodes shanghai earnings were subject to the standard central government tax rate 
as an incentive for establishing diodes shanghai  the and earnings of diodes shanghai were exempted from central government income tax  and for the years through its earnings will be subject to a tax rate 
from onward  diodes shanghai earnings might not continue to be subject to the tax rate as a proposed income tax reform is expected to be taking effect in which could terminate some existing tax incentive for foreign enterprise doing business in china 
with the recently proposed china government income tax reform  which could terminate some existing tax incentives for foreign enterprises doing business in china  it is unclear to what extent our china subsidiaries will continue to receive preferential tax treatment 
as an incentive for the formation of anachip  earnings of anachip are subject to a five year tax holiday subject to certain qualifications of taiwanese tax law 
in the third quarter of  we elected to begin this five year tax holiday as of january  as of december   accumulated and undistributed earnings of diodes china and diodes shanghai are approximately million  including million of restricted earnings which are not available for dividends 
through march   we had not recorded deferred us federal or state tax liabilities estimated to be million as of march  on these cumulative earnings since we  at that time  considered this investment to be permanent  and had no plans or obligation to distribute all or part of that amount from china to the us beginning in april  we began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the china earnings in preparation of a dividend distribution 
in the year ended december   we received a dividend of approximately million from our diodes china subsidiary  for which the tax effect is included in us federal and state taxable income 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act ajca into law 
originally intended to repeal the extraterritorial income eti exclusion  which had triggered tariffs by the european union  the ajca expanded to cover a wide range of business tax issues 
among other items  the ajca establishes a phased repeal of the eti  a new incentive tax deduction for us corporations to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate a deduction equal to of cash dividends received in the year elected that exceeds a base period amount and significantly revises the taxation of us companies doing business abroad 
at december   we made a minimum estimate for repatriating cash from our subsidiaries in china and hong kong of million under the ajca  and recorded an income tax expense of approximately million 
under the guidelines of the ajca  we developed a required domestic reinvestment plan  covering items such as us bank debt repayment  us capital expenditures and us research and development activities  among others  to cover the dividend repatriation 
during  we completed a quantitative analysis of the benefits of the ajca  the foreign tax credit implications  and state and local tax consequences of the impact of the ajca on our plans for repatriation 
based on the analysis  we repatriated million from our foreign subsidiaries in we are evaluating the need to provide additional deferred taxes for the future earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings may be appropriated for distribution to our corporate office in north america  and as further investment strategies with respect to foreign earnings are determined 
the distribution of any unappropriated funds from our foreign subsidiaries to the us will require the recording of income tax provisions on the us entity  thus reducing net income 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in deferred taxes for earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  primarily diodes hong kong 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when our product is shipped 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our north american operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
based upon this analysis  as well as an inventory aging analysis  we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that our deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   goodwill was million million related to the fabtech acquisition  million related to diodes china and million related to anachip 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  for which goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and have determined that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an on going basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our impairment review process is based upon i an income approach from a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as market growth rates  and ii a market multiples approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings or comparable public entities 
if ever the carrying value of the goodwill is determined to be less than the fair value of the underlying asset  a write down of the asset will be required  with the resulting expense charged in the period that the impairment was determined 
share based compensation effective in january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments  using the modified prospective method 
under sfas r  we are required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard  which includes a binomial model and the black scholes model 
at the present time  the company is continuing to use the black scholes model  consistent with prior period valuations under sfas no modifications were made to any outstanding share options prior to the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r  applying the modified prospective method  as elected by us  requires us to value stock options prior to our adoption of sfas under the fair value method and expense these amounts over the stock options remaining vesting period 
this resulted in the expensing of million in the year ended december   which was recorded within the cost of goods sold expense  general and administrative expense and research and development expense on our condensed consolidated income statement 
in addition  sfas r requires us to reflect any tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash inflow in our statement of cash flows rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior periods see note share based compensation for details 
we have changed our primary award type to employees from stock options to stock awards as an improved method of employee reward and retention 
in general  we increased the vesting period from three years to four years  and reduced the number of shares subject to the award by a factor of three 
we have  restricted stock grants outstanding as of december  the restricted stock grants will be recorded each quarter as a non cash operating expense item 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in the year ended december   an expense of million was recorded 
in addition to the expense  the effects of the restricted stock grants are included in the diluted shares outstanding calculation 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase decrease of such items from period to period

sg a  as a percentage of net sales  was in  compared to in included in sg a for the year ended december  was an approximate  adjustment due to an overstatement of restricted share grant expense recorded in for comparable purposes  excluding the million of share based compensation  sg a for the year ended december  would have improved to of total sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses r d in increased million to million  or of net sales from million  or of net sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level  and  to a lesser extent  at the packaging level 
we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on next generation processes and packaging technologies 
our current goal is to maintain r d at of revenue as we continue to bring proprietary technology and advanced devices to the market 
interest income expense net interest income for was million compared to net interest income of  in  due primarily to interest income earned on proceeds from the offering of convertible notes  as well as to a reduction in our bank loans from million at december  to million at december  our interest income is generated from interest earned on our million cash balances and million short term investments 
our interest expense is primarily the million interest payable for million convertible notes 
other income loss other loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to other income  for the same period of included in other expense for the year ended december   was an approximate million one time  non cash  prior periods adjustment due to the understatement of intercompany currency exchange losses at our taiwan subsidiary 
income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to million or for the same period in  due primarily to higher income in the us at higher tax rates and accrued dividend related taxes for our foreign subsidiaries 
minority interest in joint venture earnings minority interest in joint venture earnings primarily represented the minority investor s share of the earnings of our china subsidiaries for the period 
the joint venture investments were eliminated in the consolidations of our financial statements  and the activities of diodes china  diodes shanghai and diodes anachip were included therein 
as of december   we had controlling interests in diodes china and diodes shanghai  and a controlling interest in diodes anachip 
net income we generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december  for comparison purposes  excluding million net of tax stock option expenses  pro forma net income was million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the same period in year compared to year net sales net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to an approximately increase in units sold as a result of increased end market demand for our products  partly offset by a decrease in asps

gain on sale of fixed assets gain on sale of fixed assets of  for was due primarily to a gain on the termination of two capital leases in china 
interest income expense net interest income for was  compared to net interest expense of  in  due primarily to interest income earned on proceeds from our public offering of equity securities in  as well as to a reduction in our total debt from million at december  to million at december  our interest income is generated from interest earned on our cash balances and short term investments 
our interest expense has been primarily the result of borrowings to finance the fabtech acquisition in  as well as our ongoing investment in  and expansion of  our diodes china and diodes shanghai manufacturing facilities 
other income other income for increased  from  due primarily to lower currency exchange losses in taiwan as well as the expiration of management incentive agreements associated with the fabtech acquisition 
income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to million or for the same period in  due primarily to an increase in profits earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
minority interest in joint venture earnings minority interest in joint venture earnings represents the minority investor s share of the income of diodes china and diodes shanghai established in 
the increase in these subsidiaries income for the twelve months ended december  is primarily the result of increased sales and manufacturing efficiencies 
as of december   we had a controlling interest in each of these subsidiaries 
net income we generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the same period in this increase in net income is due primarily to the net sales increase at a gross profit margin of for  compared to a gross profit margin of in financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash  funds from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our inventory and capital expenditure needs 
for  and  our working capital was million  million  and million  respectively 
we anticipate our working capital position will be sufficient for at least the next months 
during  we sold million stock split adjusted shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering  raising approximately million net of commissions and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip acquisition  and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including additional acquisitions 
on october  we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  we intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we incurred approximately million of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of investment banker fees  legal and accounting fees 
these costs are classified within other assets and are being amortized as a component of interest expense using the straight line method over the life of the notes from issuance through october  in  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and  to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facility in the united states  and an office building in taiwan 
excluding this non production related million building purchase in taiwan  the capital expenditures for were approximately of revenue  which is in the range of our full year estimate 
discussion of cash flows cash and short term investments have increased from million at december   to million at december   to million at december  the increase from to was primarily due to the proceeds from the follow on offering 
during  we increased short term investments to million from the proceeds of the convertible note offering 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during was million  resulting primarily from million of net income in this period 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for and million for net cash provided by operations increased by million from to this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in our net income from million in to million in  million increase in non cash  share based compensation expense  and million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by increases in inventories  resulting from slower inventory turns  and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets 
we continue to closely monitor our credit terms with our customers  while at times providing extended terms  primarily required by our customers in asia and europe

fas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
fas is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material

 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
fin also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effects  if any  of adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we continue to evaluate the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements  and at this time  we do not know the impact upon adoption of this standard 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
taxes within the scope of eitf issue no 
include any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but are not limited to  sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes  and some excise taxes 
the eitf concluded that the presentation of these taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements 
the company s policy is to exclude all such taxes  if any  from revenue 
the provisions of eitf are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf will not have any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  we do not regularly employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
therefore  we do experience currency gains and losses 
if the chinese yuan and the taiwanese dollar were to strengthen or weaken by against the us dollar  we would experience currency losses of approximately  and  respectively 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
the chinese government does not permit the chinese yuan to float and be traded freely compared to other world currencies 
should the chinese government allow a significant chinese yuan appreciation  and we do not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
interest rate risk 
we have credit facilities with us and asian financial institutions as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of our long term debt 
the interest rate under the swap agreement was fixed at and was based on the notional amount of us million as of december  the swap contract was inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and was therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge was measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
at november  the interest rate swap agreement on our long term debt expired 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million  including million convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  political risk 
we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china and taiwan 
the possibility of political conflict between the two countries or with the united states could have an adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business segments and to generate profits
