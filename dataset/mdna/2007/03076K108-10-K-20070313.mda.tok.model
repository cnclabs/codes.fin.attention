item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the year ended december  results reflect a successful execution of our goals and objectives that were set during continued growth of our franchise in our existing markets was complimented by the expansion into other growth markets both by acquisition and de novo branching 
recruiting efforts that began in continued during the year and paid dividends as the company was able to bolster production and sales staffs considerably across our footprint 
the company completed two very important initiatives that were critical to our long term success 
our efforts to collapse our charters into a single bank charter and adopt a uniform brand across our geographic footprint were completed successfully in december this effort required enormous amounts of planning  and our company s employees handled the responsibility of maintaining excellent customer relationships through the changes in an extraordinarily professional manner 
the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared to million  or per diluted share  in our earnings during reflect non recurring income of million after tax related to the sale of three bank charters to unrelated parties as well as  of non recurring expenses associated with the corporate restructuring announced during and completed in december during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred approximately million in non recurring expenses associated with the first stages of the corporate restructuring 
total assets at december  were approximately billion  an increase of million  or  from total assets of billion at december  this level includes approximately million of total assets related to the purchase of islands on december  during  the pace of growth in loans and deposits from existing markets continued at a double digit pace as momentum from the corporate restructuring and a re invigorated sales culture began to take hold 
internal growth in loans for  excluding the acquisition of islands  was million  or  while internal growth of deposits was million  an increase of 
net interest income for the year grew solidly as the company benefited from a favorable interest rate environment as well as double digit growth in earning assets 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million compared to million for  an increase of 
the company s net interest margin tightened slightly during the year to from in operating expenses grew during to million from million in this growth in operating expenses during relates primarily to the acquisition of fnb in december and to continued efforts to expand sales and production staff in most of our markets 
despite the growth in operating expenses  the efficiency ratio improved during the year to from in ameris s credit quality improved substantially in due primarily to a reduction in problem loans acquired through mergers 
non performing assets as a percentage of total loans at the end of were  a decrease from the reported at the end of for the year ended december   ameris had net charge offs of compared to in the company s loan loss reserve as a percentage of loans fell to at december  from at december  
table of contents critical accounting policies ameris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of ameris s operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by ameris represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
the accounting for impaired loans described above applies to all loans  except for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value and debt securities 
the allowance for loan losses for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans is established through consideration of such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  adequacy of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  historical charge off trends and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 

table of contents certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
an increase in interest rates by the federal reserve would favorably impact our net interest margin 
an improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect ameris s loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream 
conversely  certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings 
a significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower s ability to pay 
we will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy 
another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
at december   we had credit relationships that exceeded million with the largest credit relationship being approximately million 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors 
those loans are secured by real estate in ameris s primary market area 
a substantial portion of other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes to market conditions in ameris s primary market area 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax assets of million  which includes amounts relating to loss carryforwards 
we believe there will be sufficient taxable income in the future to allow us to utilize these loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where they exist 

table of contents long lived assets  including intangibles in our financial statements  we have recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which represents the amount by which the price we paid for acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of tangible assets acquired plus the liabilities assumed 
we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment  specifically identifiable intangibles and goodwill  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets might not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
in determining the existence of impairment factors  our assessment is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of our company 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets might be impaired 
in accordance with accounting rules promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  no amount of goodwill was expensed in  or net income and earnings per share in  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in and million  or per diluted share  in our return on average assets was  and in  and  respectively

earning assets and liabilities average earning assets in increased over levels principally due to the acquisition of fnb in december additional growth from the company s existing markets also continued at double digit levels for the second consecutive year 
the earning asset and interest bearing liability mix is consistently monitored to increase net interest margin and therefore increase profitability 
the following statistical information should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report and in the documents incorporated herein by reference

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest bearing assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our interest earning assets include loans  investment securities  interest bearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold 
our interest bearing liabilities include deposits  other short term borrowings  fhlb advances and subordinated debentures

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent auditors and regulatory authorities  we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan classifications within each type of loan based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans require specific allowances 
allowances are provided for other types and classifications of loans based on anticipated loss rates 
allowances are also provided for loans that are reviewed by management and considered creditworthy and loans for which management determines no review is required 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience with an emphasis on current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the bank operates 
factors considered include among others  unemployment rates  effect of weather on agriculture and significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 
we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve which is monitored by the company s senior credit officer and internal audit staff 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides seven ratings of which three ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of reserve 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer 
as a result of loan review  certain loans may be assigned specific reserve allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific reserves 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 

table of contents the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated 
management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

any loans classified by regulatory authorities as loss have been charged off 
liquidity and rate sensitivity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs  and the ability of our company to meet those needs 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally interest bearing deposits in banks and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
in addition  our company maintains relationships with correspondent banks which could provide funds to them on short notice  if needed 
a principal objective of our asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 

table of contents as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the portfolio due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  primarily with five to fifteen year maturities  are also made on a variable rate basis with rates being adjusted every one to five years

interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  we are somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis points increase or basis points decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
our most recent simulation model projects net interest income would increase if rates rise basis points gradually over the next year 
on the other hand  the model projects net interest income to decrease if rates decline basis points over the next year
