item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we deliver infrastructure software for the open enterprise 
we are a leader in desktop to data center operating systems based on linux and the software required to secure and manage mixed information technology it environments 
we help customers around the world minimize cost  complexity  and risk  allowing them to focus on innovation and growth 
to best align our business with our strategy  we are organized into four business segments 
our business segments are open platform solutions  identity and security management  systems and resource management  and workgroup 
during fiscal  we divested our business consulting segment through the sale of salmon  our uk based consulting unit  in the second quarter of fiscal and as a result of an agreement to sell our ctp switzerland consulting unit that we entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal below is an update on each of our business units within our open platform solutions business unit segment  linux and open source products remain an important growth business 
during the year we established and expanded relationships with several strategic partners to increase the reach of both our server and desktop products 
revenue from our linux platform products increased year over year in fiscal the strength of our revenue growth was due in part to our agreement with microsoft which was signed in november we continue to expand our position in the identity and security management market by offering products that deliver a complete  integrated solution in the areas of security  compliance  and governance issues 
our unique role based  policy driven approach has received positive industry reviews 
revenue from our identity and access management products increased in fiscal as compared to the same period a year ago 
systems and resource management products continue to be an important part of our product offering 
our strategy is to provide a complete desktop to data center offering  with leadership in virtualization for both linux and mixed source environments 
earlier this year  we announced the general availability of two major products  zenworks configuration management and zenworks orchestrator 
we believe these products will become a new source of growth in the future 
revenue was relatively flat in fiscal as the market was anticipating a refreshed product offering 
our workgroup revenue base is an important source of cash flow and provides us with a potential opportunity to sell additional products and services 
we continued efforts to stabilize the decline of revenue from our legacy products  such as open enterprise server  netware and netware related products 
at the end of fiscal  we announced the general availability of open enterprise server  which completes the transition of delivering netware services on linux 
we also introduced novell teaming conferencing  which extends the value of our collaboration offering 
our workgroup business declined in fiscal  excluding the impact of the microsoft agreement  as compared to the same period a year ago 
at the beginning of the fiscal year  we identified several key initiatives including  improving our sales model and sales staff specialization  integrating our product development approach and balancing between on and offshore development locations  and improving administrative and support functions with the primary goal to simplify and refocus our business and increase sustainable profitability 
we have substantially completed these initiatives according to plan 
in conjunction with these initiatives  we incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal in continuation of our two year strategic plan  we will refine the improvements we made in our sales  research and development  and back office initiatives in fiscal in addition  we will realign our services business to improve its efficiency and focus 
in conjunction with these initiatives  we expect to incur restructuring charges of n 
table of contents million to million in fiscal while our initiatives and their implementation involve opportunities  risks  and challenges  we believe they will result in long term  sustainable profitability 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and related reserves  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  loss contingency accruals and share based payments to be critical accounting policies due to the judgments and estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition and related reserves 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software licenses  software maintenance  upgrade protection  subscriptions of suse linux enterprise server sles  technical support  training  and professional services 
our customers include distributors  who sell our products to resellers  dealers  and vars  oems  who integrate our products with their products or solutions  vars  who provide solutions across multiple vertical market segments which usually includes services  and end users  who may purchase our products and services directly from novell or from other partners or resellers 
except for our suse linux product  distributors do not order to stock and only order products when they have an end customer order  which they present to us 
with respect to our suse linux product  distributors place orders and the product is then sold through to end customers principally through the retail channel 
oems report the number of copies duplicated and sold via an activity or royalty report 
software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles typically involve one to three year contract terms 
our standard practice is to provide customers with a day general right of return 
such return provision allows for a refund and or credit of any amount paid by our customers 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
when an arrangement does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software or does not contain services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered typically in the form of a signed contract or statement of work accompanied by a purchase order 
delivery has occurred for software licenses  delivery takes place when the customer is given access to the software programs via access to a website or shipped medium 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to cancellation or other payment terms that exceed our standard payment terms 
typical payment terms are net days 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is creditworthy and collection is probable 
prior novell established credit history  credit reports  financial statements  and bank references are used to assess creditworthiness 
in general  revenue for transactions that do not involve software customization or services considered essential to the functionality of the software is recognized as follows software license fees for our suse linux product are recognized when the product is sold through to an end customer  software license fees for sales through oems are recognized upon receipt of license activity or royalty reports  all other software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software  n 
table of contents software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles are recognized ratably over the contract term  and professional services  training and other similar services are recognized as the services are performed 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors  such as bankruptcy 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect future returns or bad debts  adjustments to these reserves may be required that would increase or decrease revenue or net income 
many of our software arrangements include multiple elements 
such elements typically include any or all of the following software licenses  rights to additional software products  software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  training and professional services 
for multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software and do not involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we allocate value to each element based on its relative fair value  if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
novell specific objective evidence of fair value is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but does not exist for the delivered element  typically the software  then the residual method is used to allocate value to each element 
under the residual method  each undelivered element is allocated value based on novell specific objective evidence of fair value for that element  as described above  and the remainder of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element  typically the software 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements and the arrangement involves rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
if the arrangement does not involve rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is initially deferred until typically the only remaining undelivered element is software maintenance or technical support  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support term 
in the case of multiple element arrangements that involve significant modification or customization of the software or involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting is applied 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for software maintenance or technical support in arrangements requiring contract accounting  the professional services and license fees are combined and revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is generally calculated using estimated hours incurred to date relative to the total expected hours for the entire project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
the maintenance or support fee is unbundled from the other elements and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance or support term 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for software maintenance or support  then all revenue is deferred until completion of the professional services  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support period 
for consolidated statements of operations classification purposes only  we allocate the revenue first to those elements for which we have novell specific objective evidence of fair value  and any remaining recognized revenue is then allocated to those items for which we lack novell specific objective evidence of fair value 
professional services contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized based on the proportional performance method  generally using estimated time to complete to measure the completed effort 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
professional services revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients

table of contents microsoft agreements related revenue on november   we entered into a business collaboration agreement  a technical collaboration agreement  and a patent cooperation agreement with microsoft corporation that collectively are designed to build  market and support a series of new solutions to make novell and microsoft products work better together for customers 
each of the agreements is scheduled to expire on january  under the business collaboration agreement  we are marketing a combined offering with microsoft 
the combined offering consists of suse linux enterprise server and a subscription for sles support along with microsoft windows server  microsoft virtual server and microsoft viridian  and is offered to customers desiring to deploy linux and windows in a virtualized setting 
microsoft made an upfront payment to us of million for sles subscription certificates  which microsoft may use  resell or otherwise distribute over the term of the agreement  allowing the certificate holder to redeem single or multi year subscriptions for sles support from us entitling the certificate holder to upgrades  updates and technical support 
microsoft agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for marketing linux and windows virtualization scenarios and also agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for a microsoft sales force devoted primarily to marketing the combined offering 
microsoft agreed that for three years following the initial date of the agreement it will not enter into an agreement with any other linux distributor to encourage adoption of non novell linux windows server virtualization through a program substantially similar to the sles subscription certificate distribution program 
the technical collaboration agreement focuses primarily on four areas development of technologies to optimize sles and windows  each running as guests in a virtualized setting on the other operating system  development of management tools for managing heterogeneous virtualization environments  to enable each party s management tools to command  control and configure the other party s operating system in a virtual machine environment  development of translators to improve interoperability between microsoft office and openoffice document formats  and collaboration on improving directory and identity interoperability and identity management between microsoft active directory software and novell edirectory software 
under the technical collaboration agreement  microsoft agreed to provide funding to help accomplish these broad objectives  subject to certain limitations 
under the patent cooperation agreement  microsoft agreed to covenant with our customers not to assert its patents against our customers for their use of our products and services for which we receive revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions  while we agreed to covenant with microsoft s customers not to assert our patents against microsoft s customers for their use of microsoft products and services for which microsoft receives revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions 
in addition  we and microsoft each irrevocably released the other party  and its customers  from any liability for patent infringement arising prior to november   with certain exceptions 
both we and microsoft have payment obligations under the patent cooperation agreement 
microsoft made an upfront net balancing payment to us of million  and we will make ongoing payments to microsoft totaling a minimum of million over the five year term of the agreement based on a percentage of our open platform solutions and open enterprise server revenues 
as the three agreements are interrelated and were negotiated and executed simultaneously  for accounting purposes we considered all of the agreements to constitute one arrangement containing multiple elements 
the sles subscription purchases of million were within the scope of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and are being accounted for based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
we will recognize the revenue ratably over the respective subscription terms beginning upon customer activation  or for subscriptions which expire un activated  if any  we will recognize revenue upon subscription expiration 
objective evidence of the fair value of elements within the patent cooperation agreement and technical collaboration agreement did not exist 
as such  we combined the million for the patent cooperation n 
table of contents agreement payment and amounts we will receive for the technical collaboration agreement and are recognizing this revenue ratably over the contractual term of the agreements of years 
our periodic payments to microsoft will be recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the contractual expenditures by microsoft  including the dedicated sales force of million and the marketing funds of million  do not obligate us to perform  and  therefore  do not have an accounting consequence to us 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets include net fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
at october   our long lived assets included million of net fixed assets  million of long term investments  million of goodwill  and million of identifiable intangible assets 
we periodically review our property  plant  and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could indicate an impairment include significant underperformance of the asset as compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the actual or intended use of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  which we estimate based on discounted expected future cash flows 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of august  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant  such as a material adverse change in the business 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value 
fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes in reporting units and changes to the estimates used in the analyses  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the reporting units or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
future analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to million  the full amount of our goodwill  depending on the estimated value of the reporting units and the value of the net assets attributable to those reporting units at that time 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal   and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment reviews and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
these assessments are made at the reporting unit level  and therefore we could be subject to an impairment charge to goodwill if any one of our reporting units does not perform in line with forecasts in the future 
in addition  changes in the assumptions used in the analyses could have changed the resulting outcomes 
for example  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units at august   we made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on our fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes in our company as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
developed technology is amortized over three years as a cost of revenue 
customer contractual relationships are amortized over one to three years as a sales expense 
most of our trademarks trade names have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the e security n 
table of contents acquisition 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the ximian acquisition 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the silverstream and suse acquisitions 
deferred tax assets 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
based on all the available evidence  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining us net deferred tax assets  and certain foreign deferred tax assets  are not currently realizable 
as a result  we continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
loss contingency accruals and restructurings 
we are required to make accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation and taxes 
we accrue these items in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to accrue for losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated  however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require us to make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information 
tax accruals require us to make assumptions based on the results of tax audits  past experience and interpretations of tax law 
when our restructurings include leased facilities  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we are required to make assumptions about future sublease income  which would offset our costs and decrease our accrual 
from time to time  we are subjected to tax audits and must make assumptions about the outcome of the audit 
if any of the estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual outcomes are different than our estimates  we may be required to record additional charges or reduce our accruals 
during fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to increase accruals related to loss contingencies due to changes in facts and circumstances 
during fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to reduce previous restructuring accruals and a million adjustment to increase merger liabilities primarily due to changes in estimates we originally made regarding future subleases 
share based payments 
on november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to account for share based payment transactions using a fair value based method and recognize the related expense in the results of operations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  as permitted by sfas no 
 we accounted for share based payments to employees using the accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  intrinsic value method and  therefore  we generally recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards and did not recognize compensation cost for employee stock options 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of two transition methods the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we chose to use the modified prospective transition methodology  and accordingly  we have not restated the results of prior periods 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of sfas no 
 we use the black scholes model to value both service condition and performance condition option awards under sfas no 
r 
for awards with market conditions granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we use a lattice valuation model to estimate fair value 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance or market conditions granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize compensation cost based on the graded vesting method 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of our common stock 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and our historical exercise  cancellation and expiration patterns 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense based on n 
table of contents historical rates and forward looking factors 
we update these assumptions at least on an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted 
we issue performance based equity awards  typically to senior executives  which vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance goals  including revenue and income targets 
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of the stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future financial results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
if the financial performance goals are not met  the award does not vest  so no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
in the past  we have issued market condition equity awards  typically granted to senior executives  the vesting of which is accelerated or contingent upon the price of novell common stock meeting specified pre established stock price targets 
for awards granted prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the fair value of each market condition award was estimated as of the grant date using the same option valuation model used for time based options without regard to the market condition criteria 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  compensation cost is recognized over the estimated requisite service period and is not reversed if the market condition target is not met 
if the pre established stock price targets are achieved  any remaining expense on the date the target is achieved is recognized either immediately or  in situations where there is a remaining minimum time vesting period  ratably over that period 
sab in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab was effective for fiscal years ending after november   but we adopted it early in fiscal traditionally  there were two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements on the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
prior to our application of the guidance in sab  we consistently applied the roll over method when quantifying financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of misstatements on each of the financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permitted us to initially apply its provisions to errors that are material under the dual method but were not previously material under our previously used method of assessing materiality either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of the applicable balance sheet accounts as of november  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for misstatements associated with our historical stock based compensation expense and related income tax effects 
we do not consider any of the misstatements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in any of the prior years affected under our previous method for quantifying misstatements  the roll over method 
n 
table of contents historical stock based compensation practices on may   we announced that we had completed our self initiated  voluntary review of our historical stock based compensation practices and determined the related accounting impact 
the review was conducted under the direction of the audit committee of our board of directors  who engaged the law firm of cahill gordon reindel llp  with whom we had no previous relationship  as independent outside legal counsel to assist in conducting the review 
the scope of the review covered approximately grant actions on approximately grant dates from november  through september  within these pools of grants are more than  individual grants 
in total  the review encompassed awards relating to more than million shares of common stock granted over the ten year period 
the audit committee  together with its independent outside legal counsel  did not find any evidence of intentional wrongdoing by any former or current novell employees  officers or directors 
we have determined  however  that we utilized incorrect measurement dates for some of the stock based compensation awards granted during the review period 
the incorrect measurement dates can be attributed primarily to the following reasons administrative corrections in the period of fiscal to  we corrected administrative errors identified subsequent to the original authorization by awarding stock options that we dated with the original authorization date 
the administrative errors included incorrect lists of optionees  generally new hires who were inadvertently omitted from the lists of optionees because of the delayed updating of our personnel list  and miscalculations of the number of options to be granted to particular employees on approved lists 
number of shares approved not specified documented authorization for certain grants  primarily in the period from fiscal through  lacked specificity for some portion or all of the grant 
authorization incomplete or received late for certain grants  primarily in the period from fiscal through  there is incomplete documentation to determine with certainty when the grants were actually authorized or the authorization was received after the stated grant date 
in light of the above findings  we and our advisors performed an exhaustive process to uncover all information that could be used in making a judgment as to appropriate measurement dates 
we used all available information to form conclusions as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred and to form conclusions as to the appropriate measurement dates 
under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  because the exercise prices of the stock options on the new measurement dates were  in some instances  lower than the fair market value of the underlying stock on such dates  we are required to record compensation expense for these differences 
as a result  stock based compensation expense in a cumulative after tax amount of approximately million should have been reported in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended october  through october  after considering the materiality of the amounts of stock based compensation and related income tax effects that should have been recognized in each of the applicable historic periods  including the interim periods of fiscal and  we determined that the errors were not material to any prior period  on either a quantitative or qualitative basis  under our previous method for quantifying misstatements  the roll over method 
therefore  we have not restated our consolidated financial statements for prior periods 
in accordance with the provisions of sab  we decreased beginning retained earnings at november  by approximately million  from million to million  or a reduction of two percent  with the offset to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet

divestitures ctp switzerland on october   we signed a share purchase agreement  agreement to sell our wholly owned ctp switzerland subsidiary to a management led buyout group for million at close plus an additional contingent payment of up to approximately million over the next year based on an earn out model that is tied to ctp switzerland s management bonuses 
final closing of the sale will occur on january  the million was placed into an escrow account as of october  and will be held until the close on january  once the sale is complete  there will be no further shareholder or operational relationship between us and ctp switzerland going forward 
due to the signing of the agreement prior to the end of fiscal  ctp switzerland was classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and in addition  the agreement triggered the need to test the million of goodwill related to ctp switzerland for impairment 
using an estimate of proceeds to be received upon sale as an indicator of ctp switzerland s fair value  we determined that the entire amount of ctp switzerland s goodwill had become impaired  and was  therefore  written off 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write ctp switzerland s remaining assets down to their fair value based on the estimated proceeds to be received upon the sale 
both of these were recorded as components of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
after the impairment noted  ctp switzerland s assets of approximately million and liabilities of approximately million are considered held for sale  however  due to their immateriality  we did not classify these separately on our consolidated balance sheet

interest expense and other  net for fiscal increased compared to fiscal due primarily to additional interest expense on our debentures 
due to the voluntary review of our historical stock based compensation practices that was announced in august and not completed until may  we did not file our third quarter fiscal form q  fiscal form k  and first quarter fiscal form q in a timely manner 
in september  we received a letter from wells fargo bank  na  the trustee of our debentures  which asserted that we were in default under the indenture because of the delay in filing our form q for the period ended july  the letter stated that the asserted default would not become an event of default under the indenture if we cured the default within days after the date of the notice 
we believe that this above mentioned notice of default was invalid and without merit because the indenture only requires us to provide the trustee copies of sec reports within days after such filings are actually made 
however  in order to avoid the expense and uncertainties of further disputing whether a default under the indenture had occurred  we solicited consents from the holders of the debentures to proposed amendments to the indenture that would give us until thursday  may  to become current in our sec reporting obligations and a waiver of rights to pursue remedies available under the indenture with respect to any default caused by our not filing sec reports timely 
on november   we received consents from the holders of the debentures  and therefore we and the trustee entered into a first supplemental indenture implementing the proposed amendments described in the consent solicitation statements 
under the terms of the consent solicitation and first supplemental indenture  we are paying an additional per annum  or million  in special interest on the debentures from november  to  but excluding november  in accordance with eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf  since the change in the terms of the debentures did not result in substantially different cash flows  this change in terms is accounted for as a modification of debt and not an extinguishment of debt  and therefore the additional million of special interest payments is expensed over the period from november  through july   the date the debentures are first callable by either party 
during the period of november  through july   the new effective interest rate on this debt  including the million  is 
the million are paid as special interest payments over three periods  the first payment of million occurred in january the next payment of million occurred in july and the final payment of million will occur in january during fiscal  we incurred interest expense of million  related to the debentures and made cash payments for interest of million 
in addition  we expensed approximately million in fees paid to citigroup for work performed on the consent process

the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effects of foreign taxes  stock based compensation plans  non deductible expenses  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items of income 
additionally  the benefit of the use of previously reserved us net operating losses was credited to goodwill or additional paid in capital 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal was compared to the effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily because we had near break even earnings from operations  yet we had income tax expense associated with the use of previously reserved us net operating loss carryovers 
the benefit of the use of these us net operating loss carryovers was credited to goodwill or additional paid in capital 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal was compared to the effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily because the fiscal rate reflected a benefit recorded to income tax expense from the use of a significant amount of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
based on all the available evidence  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining us net deferred tax assets  and certain foreign deferred tax assets  are not currently realizable 
as a result  we continue to provide a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased by million in fiscal primarily due to stock based compensation and other originating assets  new acquisitions and changes in our deferred tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was reduced by approximately million as a result of a favorable interpretation of tax law in a foreign jurisdiction that made it more likely than not that the use of tax net operating losses would be sustained

as of october   deferred tax assets of approximately million pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
if realized  the tax benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity 
additionally  deferred tax assets of million relate to acquired entities 
these acquired deferred tax assets are subject to limitation under the change of ownership rules of the internal revenue code and have a full valuation allowance

 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to accrue for losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
during fiscal  we reduced our tax contingency reserves by a net million  primarily due to the fact that we closed tax audits with several non us foreign tax authorities relating to certain prior tax periods 
a portion of the reduction in sfas no 
contingency reserves required cash payments to foreign jurisdictions 
we reduced our tax reserves by approximately million due to a favorable interpretation of a tax law in a foreign jurisdiction that made it probable that a tax position would be sustained 
the benefit related to the favorable interpretation of tax law was credited to goodwill 
the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at october  is considered adequate based on our assessment of many factors including results of tax audits  past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
it is reasonably possible that our tax reserves could be increased or decreased in the near term based on these factors

table of contents obligations aros prior to retirement of the asset  while others were recognizing the fair value of the obligation only when it was probable that the asset would be retired on a specific date or when the asset was actually retired 
fin clarified that the uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement when settlement is conditional on a future event occurring should be reflected in the measurement of the liability  not in the recognition of the liability 
aros must be recognized even though uncertainty may exist about the timing or method of settlement and therefore a liability should be recognized when the aro is incurred 
we adopted fin effective may  fin requires an entity to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying fin as a change in accounting principle 
prior to the issuance of fin  we accounted for aros when it became probable that the asset would be retired or when the asset was actually retired

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also recorded an unrealized loss on these securities of million  with the offset recorded to other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these investments and realize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair values 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
according to the terms of the open invention network  llc oin agreement  under which we have a million or interest in oin  we could be required to make future cash contributions which we would fund with cash from operations and cash on hand 
as of october   we have various operating leases related to our facilities 
these leases have minimum annual lease commitments of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million thereafter 
furthermore  we have million of minimum rentals to be received in the future from subleases 
on july   we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of our debentures due the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on january and july of each year until maturity  commencing january  as previously disclosed  we solicited consents from the holders of the debentures to proposed amendments to the indenture that would give us until thursday  may  to become current in our sec reporting obligations and a waiver of rights to pursue remedies available under the indenture with respect to any default caused by our not filing sec reports timely 
on november   we received consents from the holders of the debentures  and therefore we and the trustee of the debentures entered into a first supplemental indenture implementing the proposed amendments described in the consent solicitation statements 
under the terms of the consent solicitation  we are paying an additional per annum  or approximately million  in special interest on the debentures from november  to  but excluding  november  the million is being paid as special interest payments over three periods  the first payment of million occurred in january the next payment of million occurred in july and the final payment of million will occur in january during fiscal  we incurred interest expense of million  related to the debentures and made cash payments for interest of million during the same period 
in addition  we paid approximately million in fees to citigroup for work performed on the consent process 
on may   we filed our delinquent reports bringing us current with our sec reporting obligations

b purchase obligations represent future contracted payments under normal take or pay arrangements entered into as a part of the normal course of business that are not recorded as liabilities at october  our principal source of liquidity continues to be cash from operations  cash on hand  and short term investments 
at october   our principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of billion and short term investments in the amount of million 
during fiscal  we generated million of cash flow from operations 
our liquidity needs for the next twelve months are principally for financing of interest payments on the debentures  fixed assets  payments under our restructuring plans  and product development  and to maintain flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment  including pursuing potential acquisition and investment opportunities 
our liquidity needs beyond the next twelve months include those mentioned previously in addition to the possible redemption of our debentures 
we anticipate being able to fund our current operations  potential future acquisitions  any further integration  restructuring or additional merger related costs  and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months with existing cash and short term investments together with cash generated from operations and investment income 
we believe that borrowings under our credit facilities or offerings of equity or debt securities are possible for expenditures beyond the next twelve months  if the need arises  although such offerings may not be available to us on acceptable terms and are dependent on market conditions at such time 
investments will continue in product development and in new and existing areas of technology 
cash may also be used to acquire technology through purchases and strategic acquisitions 
we also anticipate having adequate cash in fiscal for necessary capital expenditures 
recent pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure relative to uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  novell s fiscal 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial position and results of operations

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
previously  accounting rules required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that created artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  n 
table of contents interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
market risk we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio related to a deferred compensation program 
as of october   gross unrealized gains  before tax effect on the short term public equity securities  totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those current net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to revenues or expenses denominated in foreign currencies due to a number of factors including net operating margin levels and diversity of currencies 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations favorably impacted revenue by million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal foreign exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted loss from operations by approximately million in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
