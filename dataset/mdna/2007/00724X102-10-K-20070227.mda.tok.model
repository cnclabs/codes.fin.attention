item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical corporation that was formed in since inception  we have specialized in the discovery and development of prescription pain management products and expect to commercialize products that are successfully developed 
we have a number of product candidates in various stages of development  ranging from preclinical studies to pivotal clinical trials 
our most advanced product candidate  entereg alvimopan  is intended to selectively block the unwanted effects of opioid analgesics on the gastrointestinal gi tract 
for the global development and commercialization of entereg as a monotherapy  we are collaborating with glaxo group limited glaxo in multiple indications 
separately  we are also developing products that combine alvimopan with an opioid analgesic 
in addition to products based on alvimopan  we are developing a delta opioid agonist which is currently in phase i clinical safety testing 
additional product candidates are in preclinical development for the treatment of moderate to severe pain conditions 
entereg alvimopan opioid analgesics provide pain relief by stimulating opioid receptors located in the central nervous system 
there are  however  opioid receptors throughout the body  including the gi tract 
by binding to the receptors in the gi tract  opioid analgesics can slow gut motility and disrupt normal gi function that allows for the passage  absorption and excretion of ingested solid materials 
this disruption can cause patients to experience significant discomfort and abdominal pain and may result in their reducing or eliminating their pain medication 
entereg is a small molecule  mu opioid receptor antagonist intended to block the adverse side effects of opioid analgesics on the gi tract without affecting analgesia 
we are developing entereg for both acute and chronic conditions 
the acute indication currently under development is the management of postoperative ileus poi  a gi condition characterized by the slow return of gut function that can result from gi or other surgeries 
entereg is also being developed to treat opioid induced bowel dysfunction obd  which is a condition characterized by a number of gi symptoms  including constipation  that often results from chronic use of opioid analgesics to treat persistent pain conditions 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with glaxo for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of entereg for certain indications 
we are responsible for development of acute indications  such as poi  and glaxo is responsible for development of chronic indications  such as obd 
in the united states  we and glaxo are co developing entereg and intend to share profits that result from the sale of the product 
for commercial sales of entereg for poi in the united states  we would receive and glaxo would receive of the net sales less certain agreed upon costs  and subject to certain adjustments 
after the first three years each party s share would become 
for commercial sales of entereg for obd in the united states  we would receive and glaxo would receive of the net sales less certain agreed upon costs  and subject to certain adjustments 
under the collaboration agreement  we have the right to convert our right to receive a profit share for obd in the united states to a royalty on net sales of 
outside the united states  glaxo is responsible for the development and commercialization of entereg  and we would receive royalties on net sales 
we may receive additional milestone payments under the collaboration agreement upon the successful achievement  if any  of certain clinical and regulatory objectives  including up to million related to the poi indication and up to million related to the obd indication 
poi development program regulatory overview we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of entereg  and our potential to achieve revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future is dependent largely upon obtaining regulatory approval for and successfully commercializing entereg  especially in the united states 
we have completed four phase iii clinical studies of entereg for the management of 
table of contents poi  and submitted a new drug application nda for entereg mg capsules to the food and drug administration fda in june additionally  glaxo has completed a phase iii study evaluating entereg in poi conducted in europe  australia and new zealand study 
our nda was amended in april to include data from study in november  we announced the receipt of our second approvable letter from the fda for entereg mg capsules  under review for the management of poi by acceleration of gi function following bowel resection surgery 
an approvable letter is a letter from the fda to an nda applicant indicating that the fda may approve the nda if specific additional information is submitted or specific conditions are agreed upon 
the november approvable letter indicated that before the application for entereg may be approved  it will be necessary to provide the twelve month safety data  including analysis of serious cardiovascular events from study study  an ongoing safety study being conducted by glaxo in obd 
the fda s review of the nda for poi included a six month interim analysis of study the study interim analysis showed an increase  which was not statistically significant  in the reported incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events in patients receiving alvimopan as compared to patients receiving placebo 
the fda also requested a risk management plan 
on december   we announced that we were disbanding our sales force of approximately people and made other select reductions to our workforce due to receipt of our second approvable letter from the fda 
glaxo has recently completed last patient last visit for study  with top line results expected to be available by the second quarter of we expect to submit study data  along with a proposed risk management plan  in a complete response to the november approvable letter in the second quarter of in july  we received our first approvable letter from the fda 
the july approvable letter indicated that before the application for entereg may be approved  it will be necessary to provide additional proof of efficacy to the fda to support the use of entereg following bowel resection surgery 
the fda indicated that this may be achieved by demonstrating statistically significant results in at least one additional clinical study  and that this could potentially be addressed with positive results from our study cl study 
results from study were announced in february the fda also indicated that we must provide justification that the median reduction in time to gastrointestinal recovery seen in bowel resection patients treated with entereg is clinically meaningful 
following completion of study  we submitted a complete response to the july nda approvable letter 
the fda issued the november nda approvable letter at the conclusion of its review 
clinical overview our entereg poi phase iii clinical program in support of the nda submitted in june included four studies 
three of these studies poi cl  poi cl and poi cl were double blind  placebo controlled multi center studies  each designed to enroll patients scheduled to undergo certain types of major abdominal surgery and receiving opioids for pain relief 
under the protocols  patients were randomized into three arms to receive placebo  mg or mg doses of entereg 
the primary endpoint in these three efficacy studies was time to recovery of gi function gi  a composite measure of the time to recovery of both upper and lower gi function  as defined by time to tolerability of solid foods  and time to first flatus or first bowel movement  whichever occurred last 
the fourth poi clinical study in our phase iii program  poi cl  was a double blind  placebo controlled multi center observational safety study under which patients were randomized to receive either entereg mg patients or placebo patients 
gi was included as one of the secondary endpoints in the study 
glaxo also completed a phase iii study  study  evaluating entereg in poi 
we have also conducted an additional study in support of our pending nda  study the protocol for study provides that the initial dose of entereg should be administered to minutes prior to surgery  as compared to our previous phase iii studies where the first dose was required to be administered at least minutes prior to surgery 
the primary endpoint of study is time to recovery of gi function  gi  a composite measure of the time to recovery of both upper and lower gi function  as defined by time to tolerability of solid foods  and time to first bowel movement  whichever occurred last 
study was designed to evaluate certain secondary endpoints 

table of contents study in april  we announced top line results of our first poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients and was designed to include large bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  as well as simple hysterectomy patients of enrolled patients 
a statistically significant difference was achieved in the primary endpoint of the study in patients in the entereg mg treatment group compared to patients in the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  hazard ratio  p 
a positive trend was observed in the primary endpoint of the study for the entereg mg treatment group  however  the difference from placebo was not statistically significant cox proportional hazard model  hazard ratio  p 
a difference in favor of the entereg treatment groups versus placebo was observed for all secondary endpoints  including time to hospital discharge order written 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and abdominal distension 
the hazard ratio measures the degree of difference between the study drug group and the placebo group 
a hazard ratio of would indicate no difference between the study drug group and the placebo group in the probability of achieving the endpoint 
a hazard ratio of means that subjects receiving drug are more likely to achieve the endpoint  on average  during the course of the data collection period 
statistical analyses estimate the probability that an effect is produced by the drug 
this probability is generally expressed as a p value which is an estimate of the probability that any difference measured between the drug group and the placebo group occurred by chance 
for example  when a p value is reported as p  the probability that the study demonstrated a drug effect by chance is less than 
study in september  we announced top line results of our second poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients and was designed to include large bowel resection patients  small bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  and exclude simple hysterectomy patients 
a statistically significant difference was achieved in the primary endpoint of the study  time to recovery of gi function  in both the entereg mg and mg treatment groups compared to the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  for mg group  hazard ratio  p  for mg group  hazard ratio  p 
a difference in favor of entereg was observed for all of the secondary endpoints in both the mg and mg treatment groups  including time to hospital discharge order written 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and hypotension 
study in october  we announced top line results of our third poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl  which enrolled patients 
this study was designed to assess safety as its primary endpoint  and to assess efficacy as a secondary endpoint and to enroll only patients scheduled to undergo simple hysterectomy procedures 
study poi cl was the first study where dosing continued on an out patient basis after patients were discharged from the hospital 
entereg was generally well tolerated in this observational safety study with of patients completing treatment in the entereg mg treatment group and of patients completing treatment in the placebo group 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and constipation 
the results in gi  one of the secondary endpoints in the study  were not statistically significant as compared to placebo 
study in january  we announced top line results of our fourth poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients  and was designed to include large bowel resection patients  small bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  as well as simple hysterectomy patients of enrolled patients 
a positive trend was observed in the primary endpoint of the study when each of the entereg mg and mg treatment groups was compared to the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  for mg group  hazard ratio  p  for mg group  hazard ratio  p 
due to the multiple dose comparison to a single placebo group  a p value of less than would have been required in the mg dose group to be considered statistically significant 
a difference in favor of entereg was observed for all of the secondary endpoints in both the mg and mg treatment groups  including time to hospital discharge order written 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and pruritis 

table of contents study in december  we reported top line results from a phase iii clinical study of entereg in poi  study study was conducted in europe  australia and new zealand by glaxo and enrolled bowel resection patients  and radical hysterectomy patients 
the prespecified primary analysis group only included the bowel resection patients 
the primary endpoint results gi of the study were cox proportional hazard model for the mg group  hazard ratio p  and for the mg group  hazard ratio p  each as compared to placebo 
these results are not statistically significant  due to the multiple dose comparison to a single placebo group  a p value of less than would be required in the mg dose group to be considered statistically significant 
the most frequently observed adverse events were nausea  vomiting and pyrexia 
study in february  we announced top line results of our phase iii clinical study  poi cl  which enrolled patients scheduled to undergo large or small bowel resection 
for the primary gi endpoint of study  a statistically significant difference was achieved as compared to placebo cox proportional hazard model hazard ratio  p 
a statistically significant difference in favor of entereg was achieved for each of the secondary time to event endpoints 
under the protocol  patients were randomized to receive placebo or mg of entereg twice daily 
while gi was the primary endpoint for pivotal studies in our nda  gi has been measured in each study 
the data for the effect on time to gi recovery for bowel resection patients mitt population for the mg dose of entereg as an additional analysis is as follows in study  the hazard ratio was and the p value  in study  the hazard ratio was and the p value  in study  the hazard ratio was and the p value  and in study  the hazard ratio was and the p value 
the most frequently observed adverse events were nausea  vomiting and abdominal distension 
obd clinical development program entereg is being developed by glaxo for the treatment of obd in patients taking opioid analgesics for persistent pain conditions 
in september  we and glaxo announced the top line results from two phase iii registration studies  studies sb study and sb study of alvimopan for the treatment of obd in patients with chronic non cancer pain  and one phase b study  study study in patients with chronic cancer pain taking opioids and experiencing symptoms associated with obd 
additionally  glaxo recently completed last patient last visit for a phase iii long term safety study  study  and top line results from this study are expected to be available by the second quarter of glaxo and we are currently planning potential next steps in the development of entereg for obd 
study in september  we and glaxo announced top line results from a phase iii clinical study of entereg in obd  study  a ramdonized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center study under which patients were randomized to one of two entereg arms mg once daily or mg twice daily or to placebo for twelve weeks of treatment 
study enrolled patients with chronic non cancer pain who had experienced symptoms of obd  defined as having less than sbms defined as bowel movements with no laxative in the previous hours a week plus one or more bowel movement symptoms incomplete evacuation  straining  hard small pellets for of bowel movements 
this study achieved statistical significance for the primary endpoint  the proportion of patients who had a weekly average of three or more sbms and an increase from baseline of one or more sbms a week over the week treatment period 
in patients treated with alvimopan mg twice daily  met the primary endpoint compared with of patients receiving placebo p less than 
in patients treated with alvimopan mg once daily  met the primary endpoint compared with of patients receiving placebo p 
study in september  we and glaxo also announced top line results from a phase iii clinical study of entereg in obd  study  a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center study under which patients were randomized to one of two entereg arms mg once daily or mg twice daily or to placebo for twelve weeks of treatment 
study enrolled patients with chronic non cancer pain and its enrollment criteria and endpoints were identical to study in both groups of patients treated with alvimopan  
table of contents mg twice and once daily  over the week treatment period  met the primary endpoint  compared with of patients receiving placebo p and p respectively 
these results are not statistically significant 
entereg was generally well tolerated in studies and adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal gi tract were the most common in both studies occurring in of alvimopan treated patients  compared with on placebo 
these included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting 
study in september  we and glaxo also announced top line results from a phase b clinical study of entereg in patients with chronic cancer pain taking opioids and experiencing symptoms associated with obd  study study enrolled patients 
the primary endpoint in this study was the change in frequency of spontaneous complete bowel movements scbms  defined as a bowel movement with no laxative use in the previous hours that provides the subject with a feeling of complete evacuation 
the average weekly change from baseline for the three week treatment period was  and scbms for patients treated with alvimopan mg twice daily  mg once and twice daily  respectively  compared to scbms in those receiving placebo 
these differences were not statistically significant 
the safety and tolerability of entereg in this cancer pain study were similar to that seen in the placebo group 
study study  is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study designed to enroll approximately adults who are taking opioid therapy for persistent non cancer pain and have obd 
under the protocol  the patients are randomized to entereg mg twice daily or placebo for twelve months of treatment 
the primary objective of this phase iii long term safety study is to compare entereg with placebo for safety and tolerability in the treatment of obd 
the primary safety endpoint is based on the frequency of reported adverse events 
a six month interim analysis of study was submitted to the fda in september in connection with the fda s review of our nda for poi 
this analysis showed an increase  which was not statistically significant  in the reported incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events in patients receiving entereg as compared to patients receiving placebo 
glaxo has recently completed last patient last visit for study  with top line results expected to be available by the second quarter of we expect to submit study data  along with a proposed risk management plan  in a complete response to the november approvable letter in the second quarter of study sb study 
in march  we and glaxo announced top line results from a phase iib study of entereg in obd 
in study  in non cancer patients with obd  all three oral entereg dosage regimens achieved statistically significant effects on the primary and secondary endpoints compared with placebo 
the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in weekly frequency of sbms over the first half of the week treatment period 
all groups reported an sbm frequency of approximately per week during the baseline period 
the average weekly change from baseline over weeks was sbm for the entereg mg  twice daily treatment group  sbm for the entereg mg  once daily treatment group and sbm for the entereg mg  twice daily treatment group compared to sbm for the placebo group 
all entereg treatment groups were statistically significantly different from placebo at the p level 
in this phase iib study adverse events affecting the gi tract were the most common  occurring in of entereg treated patients  compared to on placebo 
the most frequently reported adverse events were abdominal pain  nausea and diarrhea and gi adverse events were also the most common reason for study withdrawal 
combination product we are developing an analgesic product candidate that combines alvimopan and an opioid analgesic 
this combination is intended to produce the pain relief of an opioid while reducing constipating side effects 
during the second quarter of we commenced a phase ii dose ranging study in which alvimopan is co administered with hydrocodone apap 
this study is designed to enroll up to patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery for rotator cuff repair 

table of contents we also filed an investigational new drug application ind for a coformulated hydrocodone apap and alvimopan product and have completed a phase i pharmacokinetic study which showed comparable drug levels in the co formulated product and co administered products 
sterile patch program adl we have determined not to continue pursuing development of our sterile lidocaine patch program 
as a result  on october   we provided notice to epicept corporation that we were terminating our license agreement dated july   under which we licensed exclusive rights to develop and commercialize in north america a sterile lidocaine patch 
also as a result  on october   we provided notice to corium international  inc that we were terminating our scale up and commercial supply agreement dated november  delta agonist program through a proprietary research platform based on cloned  human opioid receptors  we have identified a series of novel  orally active delta agonists that selectively stimulate the delta opioid receptor 
the delta receptor is one of three opioid receptors that modulate pain  the other receptors being the mu and kappa receptors 
today  all marketed opioid drugs interact with the mu receptors in the brain and spinal cord 
on the basis of preclinical evaluation in animal models of human conditions  one might expect a delta agonist to show effect in inflammatory pain  among other pain conditions 
in addition  delta agonists are thought to modulate other biological processes that may manifest themselves in disease states or conditions such as overactive bladder and depression 
we are conducting phase i clinical testing of our lead delta compound  adl during the third quarter of  we commenced a phase i clinical trial of adl designed to investigate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of adl in healthy volunteers 
we completed this single does study in the fourth quarter of and are now conducting a multi dose phase i clinical study 
discovery in licensing our pain research efforts initially focused on designing small molecules to target peripheral opioid receptors as a means of avoiding the centrally mediated side effects of currently available opioid analgesics 
while work continues on the selective targeting of peripheral opioid receptors  new research is using advancements in molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to design molecules to avoid prototypical opioid receptor induced side effects 
in addition  our discovery research team is actively assessing other  non opioid pain targets 
the overall goal of these programs is to develop medications that produce pain relief equal to or superior to traditional narcotics  while reducing or eliminating typical narcotic side effects 
we believe there are opportunities to expand our product portfolio through the acquisition or in licensing of products and or product development candidates and intend to continue to explore and evaluate such opportunities 
competitive environment we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 

table of contents commercialization we intend to maintain a strategic marketing group to support our research and development efforts and commercial activities 
we do not currently maintain a sales force to sell any products we may develop 
we had previously built a person sales force intended to sell entereg in the hospital market  but disbanded this sales force in december in our collaboration agreement with glaxo  for the poi indication for entereg  we are required to provide a limited number of full time equivalent sales personnel to sell the product 
under that agreement  we may request that glaxo perform such sales effort  at our expense 
if glaxo does not choose to do so  we may engage a contract sales organization to provide such services 
the discontinuation of our sales force does not affect the profit sharing arrangement in our collaboration agreement with glaxo 
we have a small manufacturing organization to manage our relationships with third parties for the manufacture and supply of products for preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes 
we maintain commercial supply agreements with certain of these third party manufacturers 
we presently do not maintain our own manufacturing facilities 
in june  we entered into a distribution agreement with glaxo under which  upon our receipt of regulatory approvals  glaxo will perform certain distribution and contracting services for entereg on our behalf for a fee 
outside the united states  we intend to rely on glaxo for sales and marketing of entereg and expect to supply glaxo with bulk capsules for commercial sale for poi under a supply agreement we entered into with glaxo in september as we develop additional product candidates we may enter into strategic marketing or co promotion agreements with  and grant additional licenses to  pharmaceutical companies to gain access to additional markets both domestically and internationally 
collaboration and other agreements with glaxo in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with glaxo for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of entereg for certain indications 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  glaxo paid us a non refundable and non creditable signing fee of million during the quarter ended june  additionally  in the third quarter of  we recognized million in revenue under this agreement relating to achieving the milestone of acceptance for review of our nda by the fda 
we may receive additional milestone payments under the collaboration agreement upon the successful achievement  if any  of certain clinical and regulatory objectives including up to million related to the poi indication and up to million related to the chronic obd indication 
the milestone payments relate to substantive achievements in the development lifecycle and it is anticipated that these will be recognized as revenue if and when the milestones are achieved 
we and glaxo have agreed to develop entereg for a number of acute and chronic indications which would potentially involve the use of entereg in in patient and out patient settings 
in the united states  we and glaxo are co developing and intend to share profits that result from the sale of product 
for commercial sales of entereg for poi in the united states  we would receive and glaxo would receive of the net sales less certain agreed upon costs  and subject to certain adjustments 
after the first three years each party s share would become 
for commercial sales of entereg for obd in the united states  we would receive and glaxo would receive of the net sales less certain agreed upon costs  and subject to certain adjustments 
under the collaboration agreement  we have the right to convert our right to receive a profit share for obd in the united states to a royalty on net sales of 
we have overall responsibility for development activities for acute care indications such as poi  and glaxo has overall responsibility for development activities for chronic care indications such as obd 
outside the united states  glaxo is responsible for the development and commercialization of entereg for all indications  and we would receive royalties on net sales  if any 

table of contents the term of the collaboration agreement varies depending on the indication and the territory 
the term of the collaboration agreement for the poi indication in the united states is ten years from the first commercial sale of entereg in that indication  if any 
generally  the term for the obd indication in the united states is fifteen years from the first commercial sale of entereg in that indication  if any 
in the rest of the world  the term is generally fifteen years from the first commercial sale of entereg  if any  on a country by country and indication by indication basis 
glaxo has certain rights to terminate the collaboration agreement 
glaxo also has the right to terminate its rights and obligations with respect to the acute care indications  or its rights and obligations for the chronic care indications 
glaxo has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement for breach of the agreement by us or for safety related reasons as defined in the collaboration agreement 
glaxo s rights to terminate the acute care indications or the chronic care indications are generally triggered by failure to achieve certain milestones within certain timeframes  adverse product developments or adverse regulatory events 
for example  because the poi product has not been commercially sold as of december   glaxo now possesses the right to terminate the collaboration agreement with respect to the poi product and the obd chronic product 
in june  we entered into a distribution agreement with glaxo under which  upon our receipt of regulatory approvals  glaxo will perform certain distribution and contracting services for entereg on our behalf for a fee 
outside of the united states we intend to rely on glaxo for sales and marketing of entereg  and expect to supply glaxo with bulk capsules for sale under a supply agreement we entered into with glaxo in september external expenses for research and development and marketing activities incurred by each company in the united states are reimbursed by the other party pursuant to contractually agreed percentages 
contract reimbursement amounts owed to us by glaxo are recorded gross on our consolidated statements of operations as cost reimbursement under collaborative agreement revenue 
amounts reimbursable to glaxo by us are recorded as research and development or marketing expense  as appropriate  on our consolidated statements of operations 
license agreements in november  roberts licensed from eli lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under which we licensed from roberts the rights roberts had licensed from eli lilly for entereg 
we have made license and milestone payments under this agreement totaling million 
if entereg receives regulatory approval  we are obligated to make a milestone payment of  under this agreement  as well as royalties on commercial sales of entereg 
our license to entereg expires on the later of either the life of the last to expire of the licensed eli lilly patents or fifteen years from november   following which we will have a fully paid up license 
in august  we entered into a separate license agreement with eli lilly under which we obtained an exclusive license to six issued us patents and related foreign equivalents and know how relating to peripherally selective opioid antagonists 
we paid eli lilly million upon signing the agreement and are subject to additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalty payments to eli lilly on sales  if any  of new products utilizing the licensed technology 
under this license agreement  we also agreed to pay eli lilly million upon acceptance for review of our nda by the fda  which payment was made in the third quarter of we are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use technologies and biological materials in our research and development processes 
we may not be able to maintain such rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
failure by us or our licensors to maintain such rights could harm our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt critical accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by our audit committee 
the principal items in our consolidated financial statements reflecting critical accounting policies or requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows equity based compensation beginning on january   we account for our employee stock option grants under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock option grants under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share for and are disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
collaborative agreement revenues we record deferred revenue for amounts received upfront under collaboration agreements in which we have continuing involvement  and we recognize such deferred amounts as revenue ratably over the estimated contract performance period 
such revenue recognition may be accelerated in the event of contract termination prior to completion of the expected performance period or lengthened if the development period exceeds the initial estimate 
based on the receipt in november of the second approvable letter from the fda  management has revised the expected performance period and will extend the period by two years 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with glaxo  we received a non refundable and non creditable upfront fee of million and  in  approximately million of the million up front fee was recognized as revenue 
we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue through  the revised estimated contract performance period 
milestone fees are recorded as revenue when the milestone event is achieved 
amounts reimbursable for costs incurred pursuant to the terms of collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the reimbursable costs are incurred 
such revenues are based on estimates of the reimbursable amount and are subject to verification by the collaborators 
accounts receivable from glaxo of approximately million at december  is related to estimated reimbursable expenses for the fourth quarter of  and is subject to verification by glaxo 
research and development expenses we have entered into contracts with third parties to conduct certain research and development activities including pre clinical  clinical and manufacturing development activities 
we accrue expenses related to such contracts based upon an estimate of the amounts due for work completed under the contracts 
factors considered in preparing such estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  materials produced by our manufacturers and other criteria relating to the progress of efforts by our vendors 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities  as well as contract revenues 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million at december   and approximately million at december   representing and of our total assets  respectively 
we invest excess cash in investment grade fixed income securities  principally united states treasury obligations 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily the result 
table of contents of our public offering of  shares of common stock at per share in february we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
this increase was partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are adequate to fund operations into based upon our expectations of the level of research and development  marketing and administrative activities necessary to achieve our strategic objectives 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  net loss adjustments for non cash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities and operating cash flow requirements outlook our operating cash outflows for and have resulted primarily from research and development expenditures associated with our product candidates  including clinical development and manufacturing costs for entereg  compensation costs  as well as marketing  general and administrative expenses 
these outflows were partially offset by cost reimbursement and milestone payments received from glaxo and interest income earned on our investments 
we expect to continue to use cash resources to fund operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in and beyond due to continuing research and development expenses relating to entereg and increased spending relating to other product development programs  including the combination product program and the delta programs 
we also expect to incur marketing costs in preparation for the potential commercialization of entereg  however  sales related costs in future periods will be reduced due to the reduction in force instituted in december 
further  we may license or acquire product candidates from others which would require additional cash outlays 
contractual commitments lease payments future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are as follows year ending december  and beyond 
table of contents glaxo collaboration agreement under the terms of the glaxo agreement  we reimburse glaxo for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which are reimbursable to us by glaxo 
we record these expenses as incurred 
other service agreements we have entered into various agreements for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
license and research agreements with regard to our lead product  entereg  we have commitments to roberts and eli lilly 
in november  roberts licensed from eli lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under which we licensed from roberts the rights roberts had licensed from eli lilly for entereg 
we have made license and milestone payments under this agreement totaling million 
if entereg receives regulatory approval  we are obligated to make an additional milestone payment of  under this agreement  as well as royalties on commercial sales of entereg 
our license to entereg expires on the later of either the life of the last to expire of the licensed eli lilly patents or fifteen years from november   following which we will have a fully paid up license 
in august  we entered into a separate license agreement with eli lilly under which we obtained an exclusive license to six issued us patents and related foreign equivalents and know how relating to peripherally selective opioid antagonists 
we paid eli lilly million upon signing the agreement and are subject to additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalty payments to eli lilly on sales  if any  of new products utilizing the licensed technology

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities and financing requirements outlook net cash inflows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in february we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of stock options in we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  generate product sales revenues  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations  and even if profitable operations are achieved  these may not be sustained on a continuing basis 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of entereg  and our potential to achieve revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future is dependent largely upon obtaining regulatory approval for and successfully commercializing entereg  especially in the united states 
although we received an approvable letter from the fda for entereg in july and november  there is no assurance that the fda will approve entereg in the future 
we expect to continue to use our cash and investments resources to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as of december  will be sufficient to fund operations into results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
contract revenues 
contract revenues were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in co promotion revenues of million relating to the arixtra co promotion with glaxo 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues of million resulting from increased expenses incurred by us relating to entereg and reimbursable by glaxo under the collaboration agreement 
contract revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to the recognition in of million in milestone revenue received from glaxo 
additionally  cost reimbursement revenues decreased as a result of a decrease in expenses incurred by us which are reimbursable by glaxo under our collaboration agreement 
these decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in as compared to of million under our co promotion arrangement with glaxo relating to arixtra 
research and development expenses

research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased expense for reimbursements owed glaxo relating to the obd program  an increase in expenses related to study  increased expenses associated with other development programs and increased personnel costs 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition of million in license fee expense related to entereg in

these expenses totaled million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively  and are largely related to our entereg development efforts 
external expenses include expenses incurred with clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  and other third party vendors and can be allocated to significant research and development programs as follows years ended december  entereg program combination program sterile patch program delta program other programs total there are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs 
these studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development  and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a program to completion 
as a result  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the expense increase in was principally related to increased personnel expenses  including expenses associated with the implementation of fas r of million  combined with additional marketing and sales expenses

net loss outlook we have not generated any product sales revenues  have incurred operating losses since inception and have not achieved profitable operations 
our deficit accumulated during the development stage through december  aggregated approximately million  and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods 
we expect to continue to use cash resources to fund operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in and beyond due to continuing research and development expenses relating to entereg and increased spending relating to other product development programs  including the combination product 
table of contents program and the delta programs 
we also expect to incur marketing costs in preparation for the potential commercialization of entereg  however  sales related costs in future periods will be reduced due to the reduction in force instituted in december 
we are highly dependent on the success of our research  development and licensing efforts and  ultimately  upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of our products under development  particularly our lead product candidate  entereg 
we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  generate product sales revenues  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations  and even if profitable operations are achieved  these may not be sustained on a continuing basis 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards potentially available to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in and  respectively  if not utilized 
in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
at december   we also had approximately million of federal and  of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states and certain state tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal and state income tax purposes

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin is required to be adopted by the company in fiscal the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade fixed income securities  principally us treasury obligations 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  totaled million  and the weighted average interest rate was approximately with maturities of investments ranging up to months
