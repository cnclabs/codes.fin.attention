revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program have not been material 
however  polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
polaris financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
polaris has not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives polaris generally provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume discounts  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  reflecting an increase in the atv and snowmobile sales promotions and incentives cost environment during actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the company s expectations and differences have not been material 
share based employee compensation in the first quarter ended march  polaris adopted sfas r which requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
polaris adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective method

in addition  polaris recorded on the consolidated statements of income in the first quarter of an after tax benefit of 
million or per diluted share from the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
beginning with the first quarter  the company has reclassified other share based compensation expenses  previously reported in general and administrative operating expenses  to cost of sales and the operating expenses lines on the consolidated statements of income 
the balance sheet and statements of cash flow have also been adjusted to reflect the impact of sfas r for all prior periods presented 
the impact to the company s net earnings of adopting sfas r is consistent with the pro forma disclosures provided in the footnotes contained in previous financial statements 

table of contents dealer holdback programs polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product

product warranties polaris provides a limited warranty for atvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles 
polaris may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs  as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions 
polaris standard warranties require the company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
polaris self insures its product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and the company had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to continuing operations 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company had accruals of million and million at december  and  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to discontinued operations 
while management believes the product liability reserves are adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against the company could have a material adverse effect on polaris financial condition
