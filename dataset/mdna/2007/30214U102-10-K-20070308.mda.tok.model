critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  valuing goodwill and accounting for stock based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements and fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all consulting contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  such as current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections and operating plan for fiscal  we currently believe that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
valuing goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if certain triggering events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic trends 

table of contents when evaluating our goodwill for impairment  based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of an impairment by assessing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit  including goodwill  using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the th week of fiscal and determined that we had no impairment of our goodwill and therefore did not record an impairment charge 
as of december   goodwill totaled million 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r during fiscal we elected the modified prospective method of adoption  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the options  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the options  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use historical exercise and post vesting forfeiture and expiration data to estimate the expected term of options granted 
the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options granted is used to estimate expected volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share

our civil engineering practice had a strong year as we assisted our clients in evaluating the impact of natural disasters 
construction consulting is a strategic growth area that we continued to expand during in our mechanics and materials practice we expanded our portfolio of projects in the energy sector and product design consulting work for consumer electronics companies 
in our biomechanics practice  we continued to grow our business  working with clients in their medical device development as well as in accident injury analysis 
this growth was offset by lower revenues in our technology development practice due to a decrease in the number of large projects with the united states department of defense 
our revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in billable hours and higher billing rates 
total billable hours increased to  during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal the increase in billable hours was supported by a increase in technical full time equivalent employees to during fiscal as compared to during fiscal this increase in technical full time equivalent employees was due to our continuing recruiting and retention efforts 
utilization decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this decrease in utilization was due to the integration of our recently hired technical consultants 
the decrease in utilization and the adoption of sfas r negatively affected our operating income 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r our operating income and net income were million and  lower  respectively

sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that companies recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we financed our business in fiscal principally through available cash and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at the end of the prior year 
we also maintain a revolving reducing mortgage note  secured by our headquarters building 
as of december   our available borrowings under this mortgage note were million and the outstanding balance was the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a smaller increase in accounts receivable and an increase in stock based compensation partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes 
the smaller increase in accounts receivable was driven by lower days sales outstanding  which decreased to days in fiscal as compared to days in fiscal stock based compensation was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the increase in stock based compensation was primarily due to the adoption of sfas r during fiscal during fiscal deferred income taxes were million as compared to million during fiscal the increase in deferred income taxes was due to the corresponding increase in stock based compensation expense and an increase in amounts deferred under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in tax benefit for stock option plans offset by an increase in net income and an increase in deferred revenues 
accounts receivable increased due to an increase in revenues and higher days sales outstanding  which increased to days in fiscal as compared to days in fiscal the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to slower payment on two of our largest projects during fiscal the decrease in tax benefit for stock option plans was due to a decrease in stock 
table of contents option exercises 
these changes were offset by an increase in net income of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase in deferred revenues due to more pre billed fixed price projects in process at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  and  net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase and sale or maturity of short term investments 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and an increase in common stock repurchases 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs or strategically acquire professional services firms that are complementary to our business 
the following schedule summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  in thousands fiscal year operating lease commitments capital leases purchase obligations total thereafter we have a revolving reducing mortgage note with a total available borrowing amount of million and an outstanding balance of as of february  we believe that our existing revolving note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve month period 
in addition  we believe that the funds available under the revolving reducing mortgage note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated long term cash needs beyond the next twelve month period  however  we intend to grow our business by pursuing potential acquisitions  which could increase the need for additional sources of funds over the long term 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
the average effective maturity of our investment portfolio of short term investments and cash equivalents at december  was years 

table of contents notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal 
exponent has a revolving reducing mortgage note the mortgage note secured by our silicon valley headquarters building 
the mortgage note had an initial borrowing amount up to million and is subject to automatic annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed of between approximately million to million per year until january  as of december  we had outstanding and available borrowings of million 
as of february  our available borrowings under this note decreased to million due to the annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed 
the mortgage note is subject to two interest rate options of either prime less or the fixed libor plus with a term of one month  two months  three months  six months  nine months  or twelve months 
any borrowings under the mortgage note would expose us to some interest rate risk 
our general policy for selecting among interest rate options and related terms will be to minimize interest expense 
however  given the risk of interest rate fluctuations  we cannot be certain that the lowest rate option will always be obtained  thereby consistently minimizing our interest expense 
no sensitivity analysis was performed on our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  however  given the historical low volatility of both the prime and libor interest rates  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
