item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing  operations  and products security products 
our security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the postal  transportation  furniture  banking  vending  and other industries 
we believe that we are a north american market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms 
our security products are used in a variety of applications including ignition systems  mailboxes  vending and gaming machines  parking meters  electrical circuit panels  storage compartments  office furniture and medical cabinet security 
these products include disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce  pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security  including our keset high security system  which allows the user to change the keying on a single lock times without removing the lock from its enclosure  and our innovative elock electronic locks which provide stand alone security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card  magnetic stripe  or keypad credentials 
a substantial portion of our security products sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to individual manufacturer s specifications  some of which are listed above 
we  however  also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers which is offered through a north american distribution network through our stock locks distribution program to lock distributors and to large original equipment manufacturers oems 
furniture components 
our furniture components segment  with manufacturing facilities in michigan  canada  and taiwan  manufactures a complete line of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems for use in applications such as computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets  imaging equipment  file cabinets  desk drawers  automated teller machines  appliances and other applications 
these products include our patented integrated slide lock which allows a file cabinet manufacturer to reduce the possibility of multiple drawers being opened at the same time  our patented adjustable ball lock which reduces the risk of heavily filled drawers  such as auto mechanic tool boxes  from opening while in movement  our self closing slide  which is designed to assist in closing a drawer and is used in applications such as bottom mount freezers  articulating computer keyboard support arms designed to attach to desks in the workplace and home office environments to alleviate possible strains and stress and maximize usable workspace  along with our patented leverlock keyboard arm  which is designed to make ergonomic adjustments to the keyboard arm easier  cpu storage devices which minimize adverse effects of dust and moisture  and complimentary accessories  such as ergonomic wrist rest aids  mouse pad supports and flat screen computer monitor support arms 
marine components 
our marine components segment  with manufacturing facilities in wisconsin and illinois  manufactures and distributes marine instruments  hardware  and accessories for performance boats 
our specialty marine component products are high performance components designed to operate in the highly corrosive marine environment 
these products include original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers  exhaust pipes  mufflers  other exhaust components and billet accessories  and high performance gauges and related components such as gps speedometers  throttles  controls  tachometers and panels 
our business segments operated eight manufacturing facilities at december  for additional information  see also item properties  including information regarding leased and distribution only facilities 
security products furniture components marine components mauldin  sc river grove  il lake bluff  il kitchener  ontario byron center  mi taipei  taiwan neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are zinc used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  coiled steel used in the furniture components segment for the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems  stainless steel used in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components  and plastic resins also used in the furniture components segment for injection molded plastics in the manufacturer of ergonomic computer support systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified purchase volumes 
we utilize purchase arrangements to stabilize our raw material prices provided we meet the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities 
raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover all increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
steel and zinc prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends and specific developments in consuming industries and are currently at historically high levels 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names  include furniture components security products marine components compx precision slides compx security products custom marine compx waterloo keset livorsi marine compx ergonomx fort lock cmi industrial mufflers compx durislide timberline custom marine stainless dynaslide chicago lock exhaust waterloo furniture ace ii the choice in components limited tubar performance boating stock locks mega rim national cabinet lock race rim compx marine sales  marketing and distribution 
we sell components directly to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals and engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers representatives 
we select manufacturers representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
a significant portion of our sales are also made through distributors 
we have a significant market share of cabinet lock sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
due to our success with the stock locks inventory program within the security products segment  similar programs have been implemented for distributor sales of ergonomic computer support systems within the furniture components segment 
in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total sales from security products customers and from furniture components customers 
overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are placed at a premium 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
our security products and furniture components segments compete against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
suppliers  particularly the foreign furniture components suppliers  have put intense price pressure on our products 
in some cases  we have lost sales to these lower cost foreign manufacturers 
we have responded by shifting the manufacture of some products to our lower cost facilities  working to reduce costs and gain operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and process improvements in all of our facilities and by working with our customers to be their value added supplier of choice by offering customer support services which foreign suppliers are generally unable to provide 
international operations we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally furniture component operations in canada and taiwan 
the majority of our non us sales are to customers located in canada 
foreign operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss 
we do not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
we cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on our operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
employees as of december   we employed  people as follows united states canada taiwan total approximately of our canadian employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in january which provides for annual wage increases from to over the term of the contract

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
we sell many of our products in mature and highly competitive industries and face price pressures in the markets in which we operate  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
each of the markets we serve is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market  where product design  quality and durability are the primary competitive factors 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs  especially those located in asia 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  in some of our businesses new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities so they could manufacture products that compete with our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales for certain of our products  principally precision slides and ergonomic products  are concentrated in the office furniture industry which has in the past experienced significant reductions in demand that could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales of our products to the office furniture manufacturing industry accounted for approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the future growth  if any  of the office furniture industry will be affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as service industry employment levels  corporate cash flows and non residential commercial construction  as well as industry factors such as corporate reengineering and restructuring  technology demands  ergonomic  health and safety concerns and corporate relocations 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not materially adversely affect our business 
our failure to enter into new markets would result in the continued significant impact of fluctuations in demand within the office furniture manufacturing industry on our operating results 
in an effort to reduce our dependence on the office furniture market for certain products and to increase our participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to identifying new customers and developing new applications for those products in markets outside of the office furniture industry  such as home appliances and tool boxes 
developing these new applications for our products involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to our limited experience with customers and applications in these markets as well as facing competitors who are already established in these markets 
we may not be successful in developing new customers or applications for our products outside of the office furniture industry 
significant time may be required for such development and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our development of new products as well as innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
the introduction of new products and features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of such products with potential customers 
the ability to implement such coordination may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new products that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new products we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new products typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel 
as we attempt to introduce new products in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we have in the past pursued  and intend to pursue in the future  a growth strategy through acquisitions which could negatively affect operating results if the acquired businesses are not successful 
our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions will depend on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable growth opportunities and to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
there can be no assurance that we will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanding operations will impose on our management and management information systems 
any failure by us to adapt our systems and procedures to those changing demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
higher costs of our raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand 
coiled steel is the major raw material used in the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems 
plastic resins for injection molded plastics are also an integral material for ergonomic computer support systems 
zinc is a principal raw material used in the manufacture of security products 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset such higher costs with increased selling prices for our products

we recently entered the performance marine components industry through our acquisition of two performance marine component manufacturers in august and april operating income overview we reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in as more fully described below  our operating income increased from to primarily due to a more favorable product mix  the impact of two marine acquisitions  and our on going focus on reducing costs partially offset by the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
our operating income increased from to as the result of the favorable impact of continued reductions in costs  offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by million  and negatively impacted operating income by million 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by million  but negatively impacted operating income by million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the strengthening canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
the impact on operating income primarily results from our canadian operations  where the majority of net sales are denominated in us dollars while the majority of expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we also consider the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  we may be required to recognize additional inventory reserves 
we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
our determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in our inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring us to recognize an impairment charge 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to review goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis 
we are also required to review goodwill for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of our annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values of these three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that such operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in december  our thomas regout operations met the criteria under gaap to be classified as held for sale and thus were required to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
at such time  we recognized a million impairment of the goodwill related to such operations  as the carrying amount of the net assets exceeded the estimated fair value less cost to sell of the operations 
the disposal of such operations was completed in january  and therefore we no longer report goodwill attributable to such operations at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we do not assess property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no impairment indicators were present with respect to our property and equipment 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our gross deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to us in the us in this regard  during we determined that certain of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations could no longer be considered permanently reinvested  and in accordance with gaap we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on such undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of such future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  decrease or increase our reported net income in the period of such change 
results of operations compared to and compared to years ended december  change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin operating costs and expenses operating income percent of net sales cost of sales gross margin operating costs and expenses operating income net sales 
net sales increased in as compared to principally due to new sales volumes generated from the august and april acquisitions of two marine component businesses  which increased sales by million in other factors contributing to the increase in sales include sales volume increases in security products resulting from improved demand and the favorable effects of currency exchange rates on furniture component sales  offset in part by sales volume decreases for certain furniture components products due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers 
net sales were higher in as compared to principally due to increases in selling prices for certain products across all segments to recover volatile raw material prices  sales volume associated with the august acquisition of a marine components business which increased sales by million in  and the favorable effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  partially offset by sales volume decreases for certain furniture component products resulting from asian competition 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales in compared to  and as a result gross margin increased over the same period 
the resulting improvement in gross margin is primarily due to an improved product mix  with a decline in lower margin furniture components sales and an increase in sales of higher margin security and marine component products  as well as a continued focus on reducing costs  offset in part by higher raw material costs and the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased in as compared to as the favorable impact of continued reductions in manufacturing and overhead costs more than offset the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales  as well as  gains and losses on plant  property and equipment and currency gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses were comparable in each of  and operating income 
operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins increased to in compared to for the favorable change in product mix and continued reductions in our manufacturing and overhead costs were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of the changes in currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
operating income increased in as compared to as the favorable impact of continued reductions in costs more than offset the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
our furniture component segment s net sales were positively impacted while their operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts as compared to the currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year 
increase decrease year ended december  vs vs impact on in thousands net sales operating income the positive impact on sales relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translating into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income results from the us dollar denominated sales of non us operations converting into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacts margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in local currency 
general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel  stainless steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of our total cost of sales 
during  and  worldwide steel prices increased significantly 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins 
we anticipate further significant changes in the cost of these materials  from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income expense  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income in includes interest income on long term intercompany notes receivable from our european thomas regout operations of million 
upon the sale of our thomas regout european operations in january  the intercompany notes receivable were extinguished  therefore  no such interest income was recorded during or interest expense interest expense declined 
million in compared to and declined 
million in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of borrowing on our revolving bank credit facility  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense in is expected to be comparable to provision for income taxes we became a member of contran s consolidated us federal income tax group the contran tax group in october as a member of the contran tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
one such election is whether to claim a deduction or a tax credit against us taxable income with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
during the first nine months of  and prior to becoming a member of the contran tax group  we were able to claim a tax credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
consistent with elections of the contran tax group  in  and we did not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead we claimed a tax deduction 
this resulted in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
under gaap  we are required to recognize a deferred income tax liability with respect to the incremental us income taxes federal and state and foreign withholding taxes that we would incur when the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are subsequently repatriated  unless we determine that those undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 
prior to the third quarter of  we had not recognized a deferred tax liability related to such incremental income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our non us operations  as those earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested 
gaap requires us to reassess the permanent reinvestment conclusion on an ongoing basis to determine if our intentions have changed 
as of september   and based primarily upon changes in our strategic plans for certain of our non us operations  we determined that the undistributed earnings of such subsidiaries could no longer be considered to be permanently reinvested except for the pre earnings in taiwan 
accordingly  and in accordance with gaap  in we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the aggregate undistributed earnings of these non us subsidiaries 
we generated a million tax benefit in associated with the us capital loss realized in the first quarter of upon the completion of the sale of the european thomas regout operations 
however  we determined that realization of such benefit did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and therefore  the deferred tax asset was fully offset by a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at december  the deferred income tax benefit and the offsetting valuation allowance are both reflected as a component of discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales security products furniture components marine components nm total net sales gross margin security products furniture components marine components nm total gross margin operating income security products furniture components marine components nm corporate operating expenses total operating income operating income margin security products furniture components marine components total operating income margin nm not meaningful security products 
security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in gross margin percentage and operating income margin percentage in also improved over resulting in an increase in operating income from the combined sales growth and margin improvement 
the margin percentage increases were the result of a more favorable product mix and the leveraging of the fixed cost structure over higher net sales 
net sales for security products increased slightly from to  while gross margin percentage improved from to  resulting in an increase in operating income margin from in to in the gross margin percentage improvement was the result of a more favorable product mix as lower margin product sales lost to low cost competitors were replaced with highly engineered products with higher margins 
furniture components 
furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in however  operating income margin declined only 
million due to reductions in operating costs and improvements in operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and process improvements  and an improved product mix from the replacement of high volume  low margin products sales lost to asian competitors with lower volume  higher margin sales 
net sales for furniture components decreased slightly from to  however  gross margin percentage improved from in to in and operating income margin percentage improved from to over the same period resulting in a million increase in operating income 
the improved performance was due to improved product mix as lower margin product sales to the office furniture industry were replaced with higher margin sales to the toolbox and appliance industries as well as reductions in operating costs 
marine components 
marine components net sales and operating income increased in from due to the impact of acquisitions 
we acquired an initial marine component company in august with an additional acquisition occurring in april outlook while demand has stabilized across most product segments  certain customers continue to seek lower cost asian sources as alternatives to our products 
we believe the impact of this will be mitigated through our ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge to us as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain share in certain markets 
our strategy in responding to the competitive pricing pressure has included reducing production cost through product reengineering  improvement in manufacturing processes through lean manufacturing techniques and moving production to lower cost facilities  including our own asian based manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we continue to develop sources for lower cost components for certain product lines to strengthen our ability to meet competitive pricing when practical 
we also emphasize and focus on opportunities where we can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
as a result of pursuing this strategy  we will forgo certain segment sales where profitability is not possible in favor of developing new product and new market opportunities where we believe the combination of our cost control initiatives and value added approach will produce better results for our shareholders 
we also expect raw material cost volatility to continue during which we may not be able to fully recover through price increases or surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital or capital expenditure purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to as the result of increased capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to due to the timing of capital expenditures placed into service during versus  as well as the effect of the january disposal of our thomas regout operations in europe 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily the result of an increase in operating income combined with lower cash paid for taxes and a higher amount of cash generated from relative changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable and accrual balances 
the decrease in our cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily the result of higher cash paid for income taxes in as compared to and a lower amount of cash generated from relative changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset in part by the effect of an increase in operating income 
for both years  relative changes in the amount of cash paid for income taxes were due primarily to differences in the timing of estimated tax payments 
our average days sales outstanding dso was relatively flat at days for december  and days at december  for comparative purposes  our average dso increased from days at december  to days at december  due to a slightly higher accounts receivable balance at the end of our average number of days in inventory dii related to continuing operations was days at december  and days at december  the decrease in dii is primarily due to reductions in raw material during as we utilized the higher than normal balance in ending inventory at the end of that was acquired during as part of our efforts to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
for comparative purposes our average dii was days at december  and increased to days at december  due to higher raw material quantities and prices  primarily steel 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in the past three years have primarily emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
additionally  during  a new facility was constructed for our custom marine operations subsidiary at a cost of million 
the new facility is expected to provide custom with sufficient capacity to take advantage of sales growth opportunities 
in april  we completed the acquisition of a marine component products business for million  net of cash acquired 
in august  we completed the acquisition of our initial marine component product business for million  net of cash acquired 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed the disposition of all of the net assets of our european thomas regout operations to members of thomas regout management for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds consisted of cash net of costs to sell of approximately million and a subordinated note for approximately million 
the subordinated note requires annual payments over a period of four years 
in april  we collected the first payment of million 
historically  the thomas regout european operations have not contributed significantly to net cash flows from operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  we received approximately million from the sale of our surplus trillium facility in ontario  canada  which approximated the net carrying value of such facility 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  million of which relates to the expected construction of a new facility in grayslake  illinois for the purpose of consolidating our three chicago area facilities into one in order to gain certain operational efficiencies 
as part of the facility consolidation project  the lake bluff  illinois facility was sold in for approximately million and the land for the new facility was acquired in for approximately million 
the lake bluff facility is being leased back on a short term basis 
we have also executed a real estate sales contract to sell the river grove  illinois facility for approximately million with an expected close date of november other capital expenditure projects in emphasize improved production efficiency including replacement of equipment that is being retired 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
cash dividends paid in totaled million 
per share and million was paid in each of and 
per share 
we suspended our regular quarterly dividend in the second quarter of and reinstated the regular quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of we repaid a net million in under our revolving bank credit facility  and in we prepaid million of indebtedness we assumed in our august marine components acquisition 
our million secured revolving bank credit facility is collateralized by of the ownership interests in our first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in our revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations

payments due by period total less than year years years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to long term debt  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  we do not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage market risks  nor do we enter into any contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  we were not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to currency exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving bank credit agreement 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as already mentioned certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the currency exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  we had entered into a series of short term forward currency exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts was not material at december  we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  at each balance sheet date  outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
