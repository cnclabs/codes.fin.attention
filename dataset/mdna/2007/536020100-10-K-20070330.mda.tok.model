item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued purchase accounting the establishment of our asset base through december  has included acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
three additional acquisitions were completed in february these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in sfas no 
 business combinations 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with a purchase business combination  the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocations are based on independent appraisals  discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates by management 
in addition  when appropriate  the company reviews comparable purchases and sales of oil and gas properties within the same regions  and uses that data as a proxy for fair market value  ie  the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into an exchange for such properties 
any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in each of our acquisitions it was determined that the purchase price did not exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired 
therefore  no goodwill was recorded 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we made various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  we prepared estimates of oil and gas reserves 
we estimated future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired  and estimated future operating and development costs  to arrive at estimates of future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues were discounted using a market based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition 
the market based weighted average cost of capital rate was subjected to additional project specific risking factors 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties  the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves were reduced by additional risk weighting factors 
deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
while the estimates of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our cash flows  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  higher fair values assigned to oil and gas properties result in higher future depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  which results in a decrease in future net earnings 
also  a higher fair value assigned to oil and gas properties  based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices  could increase the likelihood of an impairment in the event of lower commodity prices or higher operating costs than those originally used to determine fair value 
an impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded 
unit based compensation we account for unit based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement and eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided under the original provisions of sfas  which resulted in no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the issuance of equity awards to employees 
it establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
we also follow the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which contains the express views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we recorded no unit based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  as there were no unit based payments made during the respective periods 
new accounting pronouncements there have been no new accounting standards that materially affected the company this period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot market prices applicable to our oil and gas production and the prevailing price for oil 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 
we periodically have entered into and anticipate entering into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected oil and gas production through various transactions that hedge the future prices received 
these transactions may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
at the settlement date  we receive the excess  if any  of the fixed floor over the floating rate 
additionally  we have put options for which we pay the counterparty the fair value at the purchase date 
these hedging activities are intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
at december   the fair value of hedges that have settled during was an asset of approximately million and a liability of approximately for a net asset of approximately million  which we are owed from the counterparty 
a increase in the index oil and gas prices above the december  prices for the next twelve months would result in a reduction of approximately million in the value of our hedges  conversely  a decrease in the index oil and gas prices would result in an increase of approximately million 
our derivatives as of december  through  are summarized in the table presented in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk at december   we had long term debt outstanding of million under our credit facility  which incurred interest at floating rates in accordance the credit facility agreement 
as of december   our rate based on the one month libor was approximately 
a increase in the one month libor would result in an estimated million increase in annual interest expense 
in order to finance the stallion acquisition and the acquisitions of certain gas properties in west virginia  in february  the company modified its credit facility  increasing the borrowing base to million 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have periodically entered into interest rate swap agreements to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates 
we are required to pay our counterparties the difference between and the fixed rate in the contract and the actual rate if the actual rate is lower than the fixed rate and conversely  our counterparties are required to pay us if the actual rate is higher than the fixed rate in the contract 
at december   we had two interest rate swaps outstanding with notional amounts of million for and  and fixed interest rates of and  respectively 
a change in libor as of december  would result in an estimated million change in annual interest expense associated with our interest swap agreements 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we receive quarterly interest payments at the three month libor rate 
we did not designate the interest rate swap agreements we entered into as hedges under sfas  even though they protect us from changes in interest rates 
therefore  the changes in fair value of these instruments were recorded in our current earnings 
these amounts are non cash gains and losses
