table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
acquisition effective march   the company acquired redwood empire bancorp rebc  parent company of national bank of the redwoods 
the rebc acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations which requires valuing assets and liabilities which do not have quoted market prices 
in determining fair values for assets and liabilities without quoted market prices  management engaged an independent consultant to determine such fair values 
critical assumptions used in the valuation included prevailing market interest rates on similar financial products  future cash flows  maturity structures and durations of similar financial products  the cost of processing deposit products  the interest rate structure for similar funding sources over the estimated duration of acquired deposits  the duration of customer relationships  and other critical assumptions 
the acquisition of rebc was completed on march   followed by a divestiture of a former rebc branch in lake county in the second quarter of after adjusting for the divestiture the transaction was valued at approximately million  including approximately million paid in cash  issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock  and conversion of redwood empire stock options into company stock options based on an average stock price of 
rebc  on march   had approximately million in loans  million in deposits  million in trust preferred subordinated debt  and million of shareholders equity 
goodwill of million and identifiable intangibles of million were recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
during the second quarter of  the company sold a former rebc branch with approximately million in deposits  as required by the frb in connection with its approval of the rebc acquisition 
the premium on the sale of the branch was recorded as a reduction of goodwill associated with the purchase of rebc

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and to increase diversification of the loan portfolio 
credit reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified loans category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of management attention to ensure collection 
classified loans and other real estate owned the following summarizes the company s classified loans for the periods indicated classified loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands classified loans other real estate owned total classified loans at december   decreased million or from a year ago primarily due to loan payoffs totaling million  three loan upgrades totaling million and a transfer to other real estate owned oreo  partially offset by loan downgrades totaling million 

table of contents oreo at december  was thousand compared with none a year ago because collateral for one commercial real estate loan was foreclosed in the second quarter of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming delinquent days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonaccrual loans 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that time are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated nonperforming loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands performing nonaccrual loans nonperforming nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total nonperforming loans and oreo as a percentage of total loans performing nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand or higher than the previous year  primarily as a result of new loans being placed on nonaccrual  partially offset by charge offs  loans being returned to accrual status and loans being placed on nonperforming nonaccrual 
except five relationships totaling thousand  performing nonaccrual loans at december  were either paid off  charged off or brought current in nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  declined million due to the net result of loans being returned to accrual status or being charged off or paid off  a transfer to oreo and others being added to nonperforming nonaccrual 
the thousand real estate owned at december  consisted of one property 
performing nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand higher than the previous year  as a result of the million performing nonaccrual loans acquired from rebc and new loans being placed on nonaccrual status  less charge offs  loans being returned to accrual status and loans being placed on nonperforming nonaccrual status 
except one relationship totaling thousand  performing nonaccrual loans at december  were either paid off  charged off or brought current in nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  declined thousand compared with a year earlier  attributable to loans being returned to accrual status  transfers to repossessed collateral or being charged off or paid off  partially offset by loans being added to nonperforming nonaccrual status 
with the exception of three relationships totaling million  all loans on nonperforming nonaccrual status at december  were either paid off  charged off or brought current in there was no other real estate owned oreo at december  since one property foreclosed during was disposed of at a small gain 
the company had no restructured loans as of december   and the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded if all nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared with thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 

table of contents management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  total nonperforming assets could fluctuate in the future 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the economy and interest rate environment  or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming loans and oreo at their current levels  however  no assurance can be given that increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified credit balances identified through an internal credit review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
last  allocations are made to non criticized and classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on commercial office vacancy rates  mortgage loan foreclosure trends  agriculture commodity prices  and levels of government funding

the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for credit risk 
in assessing impairment  the company reviews all nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of thousand 
nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances less than thousand  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology

table of contents asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the remaining cash flow of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  deposit flows and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts  official check fees and correspondent bank service charges 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
management assesses interest rate risk by comparing the company s most likely earnings plan with various earnings models using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes  the degree of change over time  the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve 
for example  assuming an increase of bp in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  estimated earnings at risk would be approximately of the company s most likely net income plan for conversely  assuming a decrease of bp in the federal funds rate and a decrease of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  earnings are estimated to improve over the company s most likely net income plan for simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  are not significant in the normal course of the company s business activities 
during as the company reviewed its interest rate risk position to include the acquisition of rebc  in management s judgment  the company s interest rate risk exposure would be reduced through the sale of investment securities available for sale  with the proceeds from sale applied to reduce short term borrowed funds
