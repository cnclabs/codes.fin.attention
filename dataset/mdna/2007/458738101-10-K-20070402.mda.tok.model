item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
general overview we are a company focused on developing  acquiring  and commercializing personalized health products that can help individuals improve and maintain their health through preventive measures 
we use functional genomics to help in the development of genetic risk assessment tests based on genetic variations in people 
effective august   we also develop and market nutritional and otceutical products 
we have commercialized genetic tests for periodontal disease risk assessment  cardiovascular risk assessment  and general nutrition assessment 
in addition  our alan james group subsidiary sells nutritional product brands  including ginkoba  ginsana  and venastat through the nation s largest food  drug and mass retailers 
our current development programs focus on osteoporosis and weight management genetic risk assessment tests  as well as our new proprietary otceuticals for distribution through the alan james group 
we expect that these programs will also lead to the personalized selection of nutritional and therapeutic products  and provide consumers and healthcare professionals with better preventive product alternatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are the following strategic alliance with alticor we account for our strategic alliance with alticor in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for convertible instruments granted or issued to a nonemployee for goods or services or a combination of goods or services and cash eitf no 

under eitf no 
 the proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction must first be allocated to the fair value of the convertible instruments issued 
as of march   the fair value of the convertible instruments issued was million  therefore proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction  up to million  have been recorded as equity 
revenue recognition revenue from genetic testing services is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  service has been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service is deemed to be rendered when the results have been reported to the individual who ordered the test 
revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have no consignment sales 
product revenue is reduced for allowances and adjustments  including returns  discontinued items  discounts  trade promotions and slotting fees 
allowance for sales returns our recognition of revenue from sales to retailers is impacted by giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  our sales force  along with our customers  is constantly working to ensure profitability of our products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what we and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
for product sales we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate future returns  we recognize revenue at the time of sale 
for product sales which we cannot estimate future returns  particularly new products  we defer revenue recognition until the return privilege has substantially expired or the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze sales returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we are able to make reasonable and reliable estimates based on our plus years of history 
we also monitor the buying patterns of the end users of our products based on sales data received 
we review our estimated product returns based on expected data communicated by our customers 
we also monitor the levels of inventory at our largest customers to avoid excessive customer stocking of merchandise 
we believe we have sufficient interaction and knowledge of our customers and of the industry trends and conditions to adjust the accrual for returns when necessary 
we believe that this analysis creates appropriate estimates of expected future returns 
there is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to  or exceed  the levels experienced in the past 
furthermore  the possibility exists that should we lose a major account  we may agree to accept a substantial amount of returns 
trade promotions we use objective procedures for estimating our allowance for trade promotions 
the allowance for trade promotions offered to customers is based on contracted terms or other arrangements agreed in advance 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we monitor our inventory and analyze it on a regular basis 
cycle counts are taken periodically to verify inventory levels 
in addition  we analyze the movement of items within our inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
we provide an allowance against that portion of inventory that we believe is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective basis 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense sbp awards with compensation cost for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
sfas no 
r applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value in excess of purchase price 
intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
values were assigned to intangible assets based on third party independent valuations  as well as management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we are currently evaluating whether we will adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this interpretation on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
was issued to provide consistency and comparability in determining fair value measurements and to provide for expanded disclosures about fair measurements 
the definition about of fair value maintains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value but focuses on the exit price of the asset or liability 
the exit price is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability adjusted for certain inherent risks and restrictions 
expanded disclosures are also required about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the effective date is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s financial position 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
in sab no 
 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both of the two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial misstatements 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because we had no prior year misstatements that were material to the current year s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was due to revenues of million from our personalized health segment  including million from alticor for the heart health genetic test and the general nutrition genetic test  both of which were launched by alticor during the first quarter of  and million from our consumer products segment which sells branded nutritional supplements to large retail outlets by the alan james group since august  the date of our acquisition of that business 
since alticor has not previously sold a product similar to the genetic risk assessment tests  we cannot predict any fluctuations we may experience in our test revenues or whether revenues derived from alticor related to the heart health and general nutrition genetic tests will be sustained in future periods 
recently  retail purchases of nutritional products by consumers have generally declined year over year 
as a result  we expect sales of our existing nutritional products to remain flat or experience declines in future periods 
we also receive a royalty on alticor s sales of nutritional products associated with the heart health genetic test and for the year ended december  this royalty revenue was  revenue in each period also includes minimal royalties on sales of the pst periodontal disease genetic risk assessment test 
cost of revenue was million and gross profit was million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  cost of personalized health revenue  including fixed overhead costs associated with laboratory operations  was million for the year ended december   resulting in a gross profit from personalized health testing of million  or of revenue 
cost of consumer products revenue was million for the period from august  the date of our acquisition of that business to december   resulting in gross profit from these products of  or of revenue 
this lower than normal gross profit was primarily due to the sale of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition 
we expect this below normal gross profit until the acquired nutritional products inventory is sold  which we anticipate occurring during the first quarter of revenue and gross profit results for the year ended december  contributed to a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a loss of million  or per share for the same period in research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
funded research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with alticor to develop genetic tests and software to assess personalized risk and develop and use screening technologies to validate the effectiveness of the nutrigenomic consumables alticor is developing 
in march  we entered into two new agreements with alticor to continue the research being performed 
direct expenses associated with these agreements were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in june  we entered into another research agreement with alticor to conduct research into the development of a test to identify individuals with specific genetic variations that affect how people gain and maintain weight 
direct expenses associated with this agreement were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during  we conducted genotyping tests for alticor for research purposes 
the costs associated with these tests were  for the year ended december  other research and development expenses  including overhead costs associated with research and development activities  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was largely attributable to the change in the role of the chief scientific officer from solely scientific research to primarily executive management as of march  this amount was partly offset by the recording of  of stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
in addition  other research and development expenses for the year ended december  includes  of costs associated with the termination of an employee as a result of cost cutting efforts 
these cost cutting efforts are expected to result in annual savings of approximately  beginning in selling  general and administrative expenses were million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was largely attributable to costs of  incurred by the alan james group since august  the date of our acquisition of that business and the recording of  of stock based compensation expense for year ended december  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  includes  of costs associated with the termination of employees as a result of cost cutting efforts 
this increase in costs in was partially offset by non recurring professional fees incurred in associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley section amortization of intangible assets was  for year ended december  compared to  during the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  the year ended december  the increase of is primarily the result of an increase in our cash balances being maintained in interest bearing accounts coupled with an increase in the prevailing interest rates 
interest expense of  was incurred during the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase of is primarily due to the increase in the prevailing interest rate over the two periods from in to in we recorded amortization of note discount of  for each of the years ended december  and of the  expense   is due to the amortization of the million of discount resulting from the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt issued in march and  is due to the amortization of the  of discount associated with the below market stated interest rate 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
 income taxes 
this provision is the result of recording amortization expense on the indefinite lived assets  acquired from the alan james group  for income tax purposes 
as we do not recognize amortization expense on indefinite lived assets for book purposes  this results in a permanent difference 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
royalties on pst sales were  and  for and  respectively 
licensing revenue was  and  for and  respectively

in march  we entered into a research agreement with alticor to develop genetic tests and software to assess personalized risk and develop and use screening technologies to validate the effectiveness of the nutrigenomic consumables alticor is developing 
additionally  we will play a key role in enhancing and maintaining scientific credibility in academic and medical communities 
after our initial focus in developing products for the united states and canada  we expect that we will expand our focus to include developing nutrigenomic products for sale overseas and developing products in the united states and overseas in other area of wellness and skin care 
this agreement expired in march in march  we entered into two new agreements with alticor to continue the research being performed 
direct expenses associated with these agreements were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

research and development expenses associated with this agreement were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during and  we conducted genotyping tests for alticor for research purposes 
the costs associated with these tests were  for the year ended december  and  for the same period in other research and development expenses  including overhead costs associated with research and development activities were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was largely attributable to the addition of the chief medical officer in july selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  includes professional fees of  for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of for fiscal year and  for fiscal year there were no professional fees incurred during the year ended december  for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include a one time placement fee for the chief medical officer position of  which was filled in late june these expenses were offset in part by reductions in corporate overhead 
amortization of intangible assets was  for year ended december  compared to  during the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with capitalized patent costs during interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the increase is primarily the result of an increase in the interest rate 
interest expense of  was incurred during the year ended december   compared to  in the increase is primarily due to the increase in the prime rate over the two periods from in to in we recorded amortization of note discount of  for each of the years ended december  and of the  expense   is due to the amortization of the million of discount resulting from the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt issued in march and  is due to the amortization of the  of discount associated with the below market stated interest rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash available under our credit facilities are key financial performance indicators for us 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and borrowings available under our credit facilities of million for a total of million in cash and available borrowings 
of the million borrowings available under our credit facilities  million expired on march  unused 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and  for the same period in in august  we acquired the assets and business of the alan james group 
the acquired business primarily develops  markets and sells nutritional products and otceuticals and related activities 
we paid initial consideration at the closing consisting of approximately million in cash and the obligation to place in escrow  and  shares of common stock 
we are also responsible to pay additional contingent consideration of up to  in cash and up to  shares of common stock over the next three years upon achievement of certain earnings milestones by the alan james group 
capital additions and increases in other assets were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  on august   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with alticor 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we issued and sold to alticor an aggregate of  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share 
in addition  during  we received million of research funding from our strategic alliance with alticor  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants and  from stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
these amounts were offset by  of payments of our capital lease obligations 
during  we received million of research funding from our strategic alliance with alticor   from the exercise of stock options and  from stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
these amounts were offset by  of payments of our capital lease obligations 
we currently do not have any commitments for any material capital expenditures 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is included in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  we believe that the combination of funds currently available  funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of december   the only financial instruments we carried were cash and cash equivalents 
we believe the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is immaterial 
some of our sales and some of our costs occur outside the united states and are transacted in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
at this time we do not believe this risk is material and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
however  if foreign sales increase and the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation increases  we may in the future consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate these risks
