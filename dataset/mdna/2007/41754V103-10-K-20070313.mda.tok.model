item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business executive summary harvest natural resources  inc is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  production and disposition of oil and natural gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
over our history  we have acquired and developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela and the russian federation russia and have undeveloped acreage offshore of the people s republic of china china 
currently  our only producing assets are in venezuela 
since  our subsidiary  harvest vinccler sca harvest vinccler  has been providing operating services to petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa for the south monagas unit under an operating service agreement osa 
however  beginning in  the government of venezuela initiated a series of actions to compel companies with operating service agreements to convert those agreements into new companies in which pdvsa would have a majority interest 
on march   harvest vinccler signed a memorandum of understanding the mou with two affiliates of pdvsa  corporaci n venezolana del petroleo sa cvp and pdvsa petroleo sa ppsa  to convert the osa into a minority interest in empresa mixta petrodelta sa petrodelta 
the mou is subject to certain conditions  including execution of a conversion contract  and venezuelan government approvals 
on august   the mou was amended to provide for the addition of the isle o  el salto and temblador fields to petrodelta as additional consideration for our conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
on december   at our special meeting of the stockholders  the transactions contemplated by the mou were approved 
as of this report  we have not yet obtained the governmental approvals necessary to complete the conversion  and the timing of and probability for such approval is uncertain 
in april  the venezuelan national assembly passed legislation terminating all operating service agreements and directing the government to take over the operations carried out by the private companies without prejudice to the incorporation of mixed companies for that purpose 
this action  coupled with the unfinished conversion to petrodelta  has left harvest vinccler without a contractual means recognized by the government of venezuela to address revenues or costs and expenses since march  as a result of this situation  our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the 
table of contents united states of america gaap for the year ended december  do not reflect the net results of our producing operations in venezuela for the last three quarters of the year 
we will not be able to include the results of our venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements until the conversion to petrodelta is completed 
although the mou provides that upon completion of the conversion  there will be an adjustment between the parties to obtain the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed on april   this adjustment will not occur until the conversion is completed 
since signing the mou  cvp has designated its board members and a general manager and president for petrodelta  both of whom influence harvest vinccler s operations and staffing 
harvest vinccler continues in the day to day operations of its properties in venezuela  and during the last three quarters of  it has accrued cash advances of million to fund operations 
at the request of pdvsa  harvest vinccler invoiced pdvsa for these costs and million  representing the second and third quarter advances  have been reimbursed 
harvest vinccler invoiced pdvsa for fourth quarter advances of million in february in  harvest vinccler resolved and substantially paid all of the tax claims made by the seniat  the venezuelan income tax authority 
harvest vinccler paid million additional taxes and related interest for the periods of through first quarter at december   harvest vinccler had three loans outstanding with two venezuelan banks for a total of billion venezuelan bolivars bolivars approximately million 
these loans are collateralized by million deposited in two u 
s 
banks 
the loans were used to meet the seniat income tax assessments and related interest  refinance a portion of one of the bolivar loans and to fund operating requirements 
see item business  operations  item a risk factors  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a complete description of these and other events during as of december   we had total assets of million 
we had unrestricted cash in the amount of million  long term debt of million  total revenues of million and net cash used in operating activities of million 
for the year ended december   we had total assets of million 
we had cash in the amount of million  no long term debt  total revenues of million and net cash provided by operating activities of million 
our business strategy is to seek and develop large known resources in countries perceived as politically challenging 
our strategy is to diversify risk by adding projects in countries other than venezuela 
in executing our business strategy  we strive to maintain financial prudence and rigorous investment criteria  access capital markets  create a diversified portfolio of assets  preserve our financial flexibility  use our experience  skills and relationships to acquire new projects  and keep our organizational capabilities in line with our rate of growth 
while our strategy does not focus on unexplored areas  we will consider appropriate exploration investments on an opportunistic basis 
in venezuela  our goal  post conversion  is to influence the management and operations of petrodelta while developing and producing the smu fields and the isle o  temblador and el salto fields in the most efficient manner 
we expect that amounts available for dividends will be distributed to petrodelta s owners on a quarterly basis 
we intend to use our available cash to pursue growth opportunities in countries other than venezuela 
however  this strategy is limited by factors including access to additional capital  timing for conversion and restrictions on the use of a significant portion of our cash 

table of contents the ability to successfully execute our strategy is subject to significant risks including  among other things  conversion to petrodelta  operating risks  political risks  legal risks and financial risks

operations all of our operations are in venezuela 
since  harvest vinccler has been unable to execute its facilities and drilling program due to actions by the venezuelan government  and daily production of oil and natural gas volumes have and will continue to decline 
in  we completed a ten well workover program to mitigate the normal decline curve 
harvest vinccler is currently operating the south monagas unit comprising the uracoa  tucupita and bombal fields the smu fields pending the completion of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
we began the year with average oil deliveries of  barrels of oil per day bopd and natural gas deliveries of million cubic feet a day mmcfpd 
the fields currently produce approximately  bopd and mmcfpd 
the following table summarizes our venezuela proved reserves  drilling and production activity  and financial operating data at the end of each of the years ended december   and the venezuelan reserves are attributable to our osa between harvest vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
the reserve information presented below is net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in harvest vinccler 
drilling and production activity and financial data are reflected without deduction for minority interest 
for and  the year end reserves include production projected through termination of the osa in in april  the venezuelan government unilaterally terminated the osa

until we complete the conversion to petrodelta  we will not have reserves to report under sec guidelines and  accordingly  no reserves are reported as of december  the reserve information shown above has been reduced from to exclude reserves formerly classified as proved undeveloped 
under sec standards for the reporting of oil and natural gas reserves  proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological data and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
emphasis added 
the quantities of proved reserves have been reduced to remove undeveloped reserves because of the actions taken by the venezuelan government beginning in after completion of the conversion to petrodelta  we will report our net percent of petrodelta s proved reserves 
this will include the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the three fields to be added to petrodelta as provided in the mou 
south monagas unit in july  we and venezolana de inversiones y construcciones clerico  ca  a venezuelan construction and engineering company vinccler  signed a year operating service agreement with lagoven  sa  an affiliate of pdvsa  to reactivate and further develop the smu fields 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the osa was one of the original operating service agreements entered into between pdvsa affiliates and private oil companies 
although it is our position that the osa is still in place and we continue in the day to day operations of the smu fields  the venezuelan government has terminated all operating services agreements effective april under the terms of the osa  harvest vinccler is a contractor for a pdvsa affiliate 
harvest vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the smu fields  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the smu fields 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  the pdvsa affiliate maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
the osa provides for harvest vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides harvest vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
historically  our maximum total fee under the osa averaged approximately percent of the price of west texas intermediate wti 
under an amendment we signed in august to limit our fee  the fee has historically averaged approximately percent of the price of wti 
in september  harvest vinccler and pdvsa signed an amendment to the osa  providing for the delivery of up to million cubic feet bcf of natural gas through july at a price of per thousand standard cubic feet mcf 
the osa stipulated that all payments for oil and natural gas were to be paid in us dollars 
despite these 
table of contents requirements  pdvsa paid the fee for first quarter deliveries percent in us dollars and percent in bolivars 
subsequent quarterly payments for and the first quarter of for oil and natural gas deliveries were received percent in us dollars and percent in bolivars 
petrodelta upon receipt of the venezuelan government approvals contemplated by the mou  harvest vinccler and  we believe  hnr finance bv hnr finance  and cvp will enter into a contract of conversion the conversion contract 
hnr finance is a dutch private company with limited liability 
hnr finance owns a percent limited partnership interest in harvest vinccler  and harvest vinccler ltd  a cayman islands exempted company  owns a percent general partnership interest in harvest vinccler 
all of the equity interest in hnr finance and harvest vinccler ltd 
is owned by harvest vinccler dutch holding bv  a dutch private company with limited liability 
we own an percent equity interest in harvest vinccler dutch holding bv the remaining percent equity interest is owned by oil gas technology consultants netherlands co peratie ua ogtc 
ogtc is controlled by an affiliate of vinccler 
upon execution of the conversion contract  petrodelta will be formed 
subject to the conditions of the conversion contract  as of the closing date established in the conversion contract  the osa will be cancelled  harvest vinccler will transfer substantially all of its tangible assets and contracts  permits and rights related to the smu fields in venezuela to petrodelta  and petrodelta will engage in the exploration  production  gathering  transportation and storage of hydrocarbons from the smu fields  as well as the isle o  temblador and el salto fields which will have been awarded to petrodelta 
upon completion of conversion  hnr finance will have a percent ownership interest in petrodelta 
since we indirectly own percent of hnr finance  we will indirectly own a net percent in petrodelta and vinccler will indirectly own the remaining eight percent 
cvp will own the remaining percent 
we have requested cvp to add hnr finance as a party to the conversion contract 
exploration and production activities under the conversion contract will be conducted by petrodelta for a maximum period of years 
petrodelta will undertake its operations in accordance with the business plan agreed to by cvp and harvest vinccler which will be set forth in annex i to the conversion contract 
under the conversion contract  work programs and annual budgets adopted by petrodelta must be consistent with the business plan 
the business plan may be modified by a favorable decision of the shareholders owning at least percent of the shares of petrodelta 
harvest vinccler has proposed a business plan to cvp for petrodelta  but it has not been formally approved 
petrodelta will adopt policies and procedures governing its operations  including  among others  policies and procedures for safety  health and environment  contracting  maintenance of insurance  accounting  banking and treasury  and human resources  following the guidelines established by cvp 
to the extent possible  such policies and procedures will be consistent with the policies and procedures of pdvsa and the ultimate parent company of harvest vinccler 
petrodelta will hire personnel  largely from harvest vinccler  and the shareholders will appoint the management of petrodelta 
harvest vinccler will transfer or assign its employees requested by the board of directors to petrodelta 
harvest vinccler will fill its share of management positions with employees or secondees to harvest vinccler 
the general manager of petrodelta will be appointed by the board of directors and will be in charge of the daily management of the business of petrodelta and will have the power and duties customary to manage  direct and supervise the accounting of petrodelta 
cvp has the right to nominate the general manager to petrodelta while hnr finance has the right to nominate the technical and operations manager 
cvp also has the right to nominate the manager of prevention and loss control 
petrodelta will be governed in accordance with the charter and by laws of petrodelta as set forth in annex e to the conversion contract 
under the charter and by laws  matters requiring shareholder approval may be approved by a simple majority with the exception of certain specified matters which require the approval by the holders of at least percent of the capital stock 
these matters include most changes to the charter and by laws  changes in the capital stock of petrodelta that would alter the percentage participation of hnr finance or cvp  any liquidation or dissolution of petrodelta  any merger  consolidation or business combination of petrodelta  disposition of all or any substantial part of the assets of petrodelta  except in the ordinary course of business  any financing agreement for an amount greater than million  approval or modification of petrodelta s financial statements  creation of certain reserve funds  any distribution of dividends or return of paid in surplus  changes to the policy regarding dividends and other distributions established by the charter and by laws  changes to the

the board of directors of petrodelta will consist of five directors  three of whom are appointed by cvp  including the president of the board  and two of whom are appointed by hnr finance 
decisions of the board of directors will be taken by the favorable vote of at least three of its members  except in the case of any decision implementing a decision of the shareholders meeting relating to any of the matters where a qualified majority is required  in which case  a favorable vote of four members will be required 
the board of directors has broad powers of administration and disposition expressly granted in the charter and by laws of petrodelta 
the powers include proposing budget and work programs  presenting the annual report to the shareholders  appointing and dismissing personnel  making recommendations regarding financial reserves and utilization of surplus  making proposals on dividends consistent with the by laws and charter of petrodelta  agreeing on contracts consistent with the work programs and budgets  opening and closing bank accounts  make  accept  endorse and guarantee bank drafts and other commercial instruments consistent with work programs and budgets  and implementing policies and procedures of petrodelta 
the sale of oil and gas by petrodelta to the venezuelan government will be pursuant to a contract for sale and purchase of oil and gas with ppsa 
the form of the agreement is set forth in annex k to the conversion contract 
crude oil delivered from the smu fields to pdvsa will be priced with reference to merey published prices  weighted for different markets  and adjusted for variations in gravity and sulphur content  commercialization costs and distortions that may occur given the reference priced and prevailing market conditions 
natural gas delivered from the smu fields to pdvsa will be priced at per thousand cubic feet 
the reference price for crude oil and the price for natural gas produced from the temblador  el salto and isle o fields has not been set under the contract 
ppsa will make payment to petrodelta of each invoice by wire transfer  in united states dollars us dollars in the case of payment for crude oil and natural gas liquids delivered  and in bolivars in the case of payment for natural gas delivered  in immediately available funds to the bank accounts designated by petrodelta 
an unofficial english version of the conversion contract is attached to our proxy statement filed with the sec on november  in connection with our special meeting of stockholders to approve the conversion to petrodelta 
once the conversion is completed  there will be an adjustment between the parties to obtain the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed on april  the adjustment will take into account the value of oil and natural gas produced from april  and the costs incurred by harvest vinccler in relation to such production 
south monagas unit fields uracoa field there are currently oil and natural gas producing wells in the field 
the current production facility has capacity to handle thousand barrels mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day  and storage of up to mbbls of crude oil 
all natural gas presently being delivered by harvest vinccler is produced from the uracoa field 
tucupita field there are currently oil producing wells and five water injection wells at tucupita field 
the tucupita production facility has capacity to process mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and storage for up to mbbls of crude oil 
the oil is transported through a mile  mbbls of oil per day pipeline from the tucupita field to the uracoa plant facilities 
bombal field 
table of contents the east bombal field was drilled in  and currently has one producing well 
there are currently two oil producing wells in the west bombal field 
the fluid produced from west bombal field flows through a six mile pipeline and is tied into the mile tucupita oil pipeline to the uracoa plant facilities 
development of the east bombal field has been postponed pending completion of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
infrastructure and facilities harvest vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility  the custody transfer point 
the operating service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one percent base sediment and one percent water 
quality measurements are conducted both at harvest vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
in  we built and completed a mile pipeline with a normal capacity of million cubic feet mmcf of natural gas per day and a design capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day  a gas gathering system  upgrades to the um plant facilities and new gas treatment and compression facilities 
in august  harvest vinccler sold its power generation facilities located in the uracoa and tucupita fields 
concurrently with the sale  harvest vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreements with the purchaser of the facilities to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
harvest vinccler has entered into long term agreements for the leasing of compression and the operation and maintenance of the gas treatment and compression facilities 
the isle o  temblador and el salto fields the isle o  temblador and el salto fields to be transferred to petrodelta after conversion are located in the same geographic area and have the same geology and productive formations as the smu fields 
as with the smu fields before harvest vinccler s entry in  there had been minimal development activity in the three fields during the last years 
isle o field the isle o fields were discovered in two dimensional seismic data is available over a portion of the isle o fields 
seven oil appraisal wells have been drilled in isle o which have confirmed the presence of commercial oil deposits 
the fields are located near existing infrastructure in the smu uracoa field 
petrodelta s business plan projects full development of the isle o fields over the next three years 
temblador field the temblador field was discovered in and developed in the s and the s 
temblador has produced million barrels of oil equivalent boe and billion cubic feet of natural gas from wells since three dimensional seismic is available over the entire temblador field 
el salto field the el salto field was discovered in a total of appraisal wells have been drilled identifying nine productive structures and six productive formations 
the field has produced less than million boe and is currently dormant 
three dimensional seismic data is available over one third of the el salto field 
the el salto field has substantial exploration upside from several fault blocks  which have been identified using seismic data but have not yet been confirmed through drilling 
business plan of petrodelta while the business plan for petrodelta has not yet been finalized  we envision the plan to call for the immediate resumption of the suspended development of the smu fields as well as appraisal and development of the isle o  temblador and el salto fields 

table of contents harvest vinccler had previously identified and submitted in excess of development wells for approval in the smu fields 
these wells will likely be the immediate focus of the restarted development program in petrodelta 
concurrently  we envision the timely appraisal and development of the isle o field and further development of the temblador field 
we believe the isle o field production can be integrated into the existing uracoa field infrastructure providing for early production from the field 
temblador field production would be processed at existing field facilities 
the el salto field is believed to contain substantial undeveloped reserves 
accordingly  we expect to acquire additional three dimensional seismic and undergo significant appraisal and development in a timely manner to provide for larger scale development implementation 
overall  production is expected to peak four to six years from commencement of petrodelta 
risk factors we face significant risks in venezuela 
these risks and other risk factors are discussed in item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a border dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the border dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the wab area due to the dispute 
location and geology the wab contract area is located in the west wan an basin nam con son on the south china sea 
its western edge lies approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is to the east of significant natural gas discoveries at lan tay and lan do  which are reported to contain two trillion cubic feet of natural gas 
wab is also adjacent to the thien ung discovery which tested oil and natural gas and east of the dua and blackbird discoveries that successfully tested oil and gas in the wab contract area covers several similar structural trends and geological formations  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones similar to the known fields and discoveries 
drilling and development activity due to the border dispute between china and vietnam  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained license extensions  with the current extension in effect until may  while no assurance can be given  we believe we will continue to receive contract extensions so long as the border disputes persist

regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by change in governments  civil unrest  price and currency controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  tax  environmental  safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations  and changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed  sometimes retroactively  for a variety of political  economic  environmental and 
table of contents other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss 
venezuela on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
the bolivar is not readily convertible into the us dollar 
we do not expect the venezuelan currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet short term loan obligations and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
no capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations were required in  or harvest vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports with the national tax administration and with various municipalities 
drilling and undeveloped acreage for acquisitions of leases and producing properties  development and exploratory drilling  production facilities and additional development activities such as workovers and recompletions  we spent approximately excluding our share of capital expenditures incurred by equity affiliates million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in these numbers is million and million for the development of proved undeveloped reserves in and  respectively 
we have participated in the drilling of wells as follows year ended december  gross net gross net gross net wells drilled development crude oil average depth of wells feet producing wells crude oil the information related to producing wells reflects wells we drilled  wells we participated in drilling and producing wells we acquired 
all of our drilling activities were conducted on a contract basis with independent drilling contractors 
we do not directly operate any drilling equipment 
acreage the following table summarizes the undeveloped acreage that we hold under concession as of december  undeveloped gross net china 
table of contents title to undeveloped acreage the wab petroleum contract lies within an area which is the subject of a border dispute between china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with a third party 
the border dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the wab area due to the dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution 
competition we encounter substantial competition from major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies in acquiring properties and leases for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and natural gas properties include staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such properties  the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties  and access to local partners and governmental entities 
many of our competitors have influence  financial resources  staffs  data resources and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements may  and often do  change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
employees at december   our houston office had full time employees 
harvest vinccler had employees and our moscow and london offices had and employees  respectively 
we augment our staffs from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us 
while approved by our stockholders  the conversion of the osa to petrodelta may not be completed and we may not recover our investments or be compensated for our services in venezuela  and our interests in venezuela may be unlawfully confiscated by the venezuelan government 
since april   our operations in venezuela have continued to be conducted pursuant to the terms of the osa  which the government no longer recognizes and which it claims is illegal 
as such  our future ability to contractually recover all or part of our investments and be compensated for our services depends on completing the process for the conversion of the osa and transfer of our interests to petrodelta 
if we are unable to convert to petrodelta  we may not be paid for oil and natural gas produced after march  further  if we are unable to successfully complete the conversion to petrodelta  we believe the venezuelan government will seize our assets and take over venezuelan operations 
our recourse will be to pursue claims in arbitration for expropriation of our interests or similar claims against the venezuelan government 
an arbitration proceeding may take a number of years to conclude and we can provide no assurances as to outcome 
certain conditions to signing the conversion contract may not be met 
before we sign the conversion contract  certain conditions must be satisfied  most of which are beyond our control 
these conditions include approval by the venezuelan ministry of energy and petroleum mep and the venezuelan national assembly  obtaining or filing all necessary consents  authorizations  orders or approvals of governmental authorities  making all necessary filings or registrations with governmental authorities and giving all requisite notifications to governmental authorities  completion of the conversion contract and all annexes  including the 
table of contents business plan  and the award of the isle o  temblador and el salto fields to petrodelta by the venezuelan government 
until conversion to petrodelta is complete  we will likely continue to incur expenses without receiving revenues 
even though it is our position that the osa is still in place  as a result of actions by the government of venezuela  harvest vinccler currently has no recognized agreement setting out its rights and obligations within venezuela 
harvest vinccler continues in the day to day operations of the smu fields and continues to incur expenses in doing so  however  there are no contractual means recognized by venezuela to receive revenues or be reimbursed for costs and expenses during the period prior to the conversion to petrodelta 
although the mou provides that upon completion of the conversion  there will be an adjustment between the parties to obtain the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed on april   this adjustment will not occur until and unless the conversion is completed 
the timing for completing the conversion to petrodelta is uncertain 
while we continue to maintain cash reserves  our operations in venezuela represent all of our revenues  and the funds available to pursue our growth strategy may be adversely affected by the financial demands of continued operations in venezuela during the conversion process 
until the conversion to petrodelta is complete and drilling operations resume  our production volumes will continue to decline 
since  our volumes of crude oil and natural gas deliveries have declined significantly 
the decline is due to pdvsa s refusal to allow us to carry out our drilling and facilities program for and and the natural decline of the field 
until conversion is completed  the resumption of any significant drilling operations is unlikely and the smu field s production volumes will continue to decline 
if the conversion to petrodelta is completed  we will be a minority interest owner in petrodelta 
upon conversion of the osa to petrodelta and transfer of our assets to petrodelta  we will be a minority interest owner and no longer have sole control over operations 
our control of petrodelta will be limited to our rights under the conversion contract and its annexes and the charter and by laws of petrodelta 
as a result  our ability to implement our business plan  assure quality control  and set the timing and pace of development may be adversely affected 
if the conversion to petrodelta is completed  our estimates of reserves may not be realized 
ryder scott company  lp provided an estimate of reserves attributable to hnr finance s interest in the properties to be operated by petrodelta 
we cannot predict whether the volumes of reserves will ultimately be recovered  and volumes of reserves actually recovered may differ significantly from estimated quantities 
if the conversion to petrodelta is completed  our flexibility in selling or exchanging a direct or indirect interest in petrodelta to diversify our assets and acquire additional properties may be limited 
we continue to look at alternatives to diversify our assets 
however  the alternatives are limited 
if the conversion to petrodelta is completed  and we decide to enter into a sale or exchange of all or part of our venezuelan assets with an unrelated third party  the third party must be approved by the venezuelan government 
the number of potential buyers that will be acceptable to the venezuelan government may be limited  and this number of potential buyers may be further affected and limited by country risk concerns 
further  a sale or exchange of all or part of our venezuelan assets after completing the conversion to petrodelta may be subject to us federal tax consequences 
if the conversion to petrodelta is completed  cvp and ppsa might not have the funds available to reimburse us for oil and gas deliveries made during the period prior to conversion 
pursuant to the mou  cvp has agreed to make an economic adjustment to compensate us so as to achieve the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed on april  this adjustment is to occur once the conversion is completed 
however  there are no assurances that cvp and ppsa will have adequate funds to make payment to us for the period dating back to april  the total capital required for development of the fields in venezuela may exceed the ability of harvest vinccler and cvp to finance 
our ability to fully develop the fields in venezuela will require a significant investment 
our and cvp s future capital requirements for the development of the smu fields and the isle o  temblador and el salto fields may exceed the cash available from existing cash flow and cash on hand 
our ability to secure financing is currently limited and uncertain  and has been and may be affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including the risks associated with operating in venezuela 
because of this financial risk  we 
table of contents may not be able to secure either the equity or debt financing necessary to meet our future cash needs for investment  which may limit our ability to fully develop the properties  cause delays with their development or require early divestment of all or a portion of those projects 
failure by us to meet a capital requirement could be a default under the conversion contract and cause the forfeiture of some or all our shares in petrodelta 
in addition  cvp may be unable or unwilling to fund its share of capital requirements and our ability to require them to do so is limited 
the loss of key personnel or the ability to establish and retain an experienced and competent workforce in venezuela could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business plan 
our ability to successfully implement the business plan for petrodelta depends to a large degree on the skills and experience of individuals in key management and operating positions and retaining a capable workforce 
we have no assurances that key employees will remain after the conversion to petrodelta is completed or that petrodelta will be able to attract and retain competent employees to replace those employees who do not remain with petrodelta 
moreover  as a minority interest owner in petrodelta  we have a limited ability to appoint key positions or control decisions on workforce staffing 
pending conversion to petrodelta  the actions of cvp  through its members to the petrodelta board and its appointed general manager or president  may adversely affect our ability to conduct operations and retain key personnel 
contracting policies and procedures of petrodelta could adversely affect successful execution of the business plan 
successful implementation of the business plan of petrodelta will require the use of skilled and competitively priced contractors for the development of the fields  including the drilling of wells  building of infrastructure and providing essential services 
due to factors such as global competition and the business climate in venezuela  contractors  labor  and materials and equipment may not be readily available at competitive prices 
further  as a minority interest owner in petrodelta  our influence over contracting decisions and contracting policies and procedures is limited 
petrodelta s business plan will be sensitive to market prices for oil 
petrodelta will be operating under a business plan  the success of which will rely heavily on the market price of oil 
to the extent that market values of oil decline  the business plan of petrodelta may not be successful 
a decline in the market price of crude oil could uniquely affect the financial condition of petrodelta 
under the terms of the conversion contract and other governmental documents  petrodelta is subject to a special advantage tax ventajas especiales which requires that if in any year the aggregate amount of royalties  taxes and certain other contributions is less than percent of the value of the hydrocarbons produced  petrodelta must pay the government the difference 
in the event of a significant decline in crude prices  the ventajas especiales could force petrodelta to operate at a loss 
moreover  our ability to control those losses by modifying the business plan or restricting the budget is limited under the conversion contract 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect petrodelta s future  our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and dividends from petrodelta 
any restrictions on future dividends from petrodelta may impact our ability to service our venezuelan debt 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically and lower oil production could affect the amount of natural gas we can produce 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause fluctuations in oil prices include relatively minor changes in the global supply and demand for oil  export quotas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing and oil consuming countries  and overall economic conditions 

table of contents if the conversion to petrodelta is not completed  our ability to pursue other transactions will be limited 
if the conversion to petrodelta is not completed  we will continue to assess and consider other strategic alternatives for preserving value  including a transfer of all or part of our venezuelan assets to another party  and we will continue to pursue other business opportunities and investments unrelated to venezuela 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such strategic alternatives 
without completion of conversion to petrodelta  the alternatives available to us are more limited and subject to a number of significant variables 
the legal or fiscal regime for petrodelta may change and the venezuelan government may not honor its commitments 
while we believe that the conversion contract and petrodelta provide a basis for a more durable arrangement in venezuela  the value of the business necessarily depends upon venezuela s maintenance of legal  tax  royalty and contractual stability 
our recent experiences in venezuela demonstrate that such stability should not be assumed because the venezuelan government may not honor its legal and contractual commitments 
while we have and will continue to take measures to mitigate our risks  no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in doing so or that events beyond our control will not adversely affect the value of our business in venezuela 
the actions of the venezuelan government may cause us to file for international arbitration 
as a result of the actions taken by pdvsa  mep and the seniat  we delivered formal notices to venezuelan government officials of an investment dispute under venezuelan law and bilateral investment treaties entered into by the government of venezuela 
the bilateral investment treaties and venezuelan law provide for international arbitration of investment disputes conducted through the international centre for settlement of investment disputes of the world bank 
an arbitration proceeding may take a number of years to conclude and we can provide no assurances as to its outcome 
continuing to do business in venezuela is subject to risk 
our operations in venezuela are subject to various risks including  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  change in laws  exchange controls  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  being subject to foreign laws  legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of venezuelan courts or tribunals  unilateral renegotiation of contracts with the venezuelan government and changes in laws and policies governing operations of mixed companies 
these factors increase our exposure to production disruptions and project execution risk 
remaining in venezuela may limit our ability to acquire other oil and gas properties 
under our business plan  petrodelta may not be a significant source of dividends in its early years 
moreover  our lack of asset diversification and concentration of risk limits our access to both debt and equity capital 
therefore  our near term growth and diversification must come from unrestricted cash on hand and asset based lending  rather than cash or debt from our venezuelan operations 
this may limit the size and type of other projects we are able to acquire 
tax claims by municipalities in venezuela may adversely affect harvest vinccler s financial condition 
the municipalities of uracoa and libertador have asserted numerous tax claims against harvest vinccler which we believe are without merit 
however  the reliability of venezuela s judicial system is a source of concern and it can be subject to local and political influences 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the tax claims will be overturned 
enforcement of the claims through court order requested by the municipalities  even while the claims are under review  could lead to the seizure of harvest vinccler s assets 
our strategy to focus on russia and other countries perceived to be politically challenging carries greater deal execution  operating  financial  legal and political risks 
while we believe our established presence in countries perceived to be politically challenging and our experience and skills from prior operations position us well for future projects  doing business in russia and other countries perceived to be politically challenging also carries unique risks 
the operating environment is often difficult and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to control the pace of development  our ability to apply best practices in drilling and development  and the fostering of productive and transparent relationships with local partners  the local community and governmental authorities 
financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for our projects 
in addition  often the legal systems of these countries are not mature and their reliability is uncertain 
this may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and 
table of contents operate oil and natural gas projects  as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses 
our strategy depends on our ability to have operational and financial control 
recently  the russian government began to consider legislation to restrict certain strategic projects in russia to majority owned russian companies 
if adopted  such legislation could adversely affect our ability to acquire projects in russia consistent with our strategy 
operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations  and our strategy to focus on countries perceived to be politically challenging limits our risk diversification 
our operations are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  being subject to foreign laws  legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or tribunals  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies  including taxes  governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign policy  foreign trade  taxation and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
our strategy to focus on countries perceived to be politically challenging increases our exposure to operating  financial and political risks 
our cash position and limited ability to access additional capital may limit our growth opportunities 
we have used million of our cash as collateral for debt in venezuela  and  until conversion to petrodelta  there will be no additional cash available from operations 
the unfinished conversion to petrodelta also significantly limits our access to additional capital  and  after conversion  the concentration of our political risk in venezuela may limit our ability to leverage our assets 
in addition  our future cash position depends upon the payment of dividends by petrodelta  in particular for the period from april  through the date of conversion 
while we believe such dividends  if available  will be paid  there is no assurance this will be the case 
these factors may limit our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional oil and gas properties and projects 
our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency risk 
presently  our only operations are located in venezuela 
venezuela is considered a highly inflationary economy 
there are many factors which affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the bolivar to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
the majority of our venezuelan receipts are denominated in us dollars 
a large portion of our operating and capital expenditures are in us dollars 
for a discussion of currency controls in venezuela  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
successful acquisition of projects in any international country may also expose us to foreign currency risk in that country 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this annual report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
until we complete the conversion to petrodelta  we will not have reserves to report under sec guidelines and  accordingly  no reserves are reported as of december  moreover  our quantities of proved reserves in were reduced to remove undeveloped reserves because the actions taken by the venezuelan government created uncertainty as to whether these reserves would be recovered under the economic and operating conditions which existed in venezuela contractually restricted reserves 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and 
table of contents operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used  and these variances may be material 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in notes to the consolidated financial statements  table v standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in demand  our ability to produce or in governmental regulations  policies or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  production rates and remaining reserves from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
we will not have any reserves to report under sec guidelines until we complete the conversion to petrodelta or acquire additional properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in experienced labor  delays in receiving necessary governmental permits  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  delays in receipt of permits or access to lands  and government actions or changes in regulations 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks 
table of contents described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and natural gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and natural gas production 
in order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy 
we are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy 
loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we had a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  compared with earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the loss for is due to the inability to recognize equity earnings for the producing operations in venezuela since the second quarter of and charges of million for additional taxes and related interest in venezuela for through we will not be able to report the results of our venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements until the conversion to petrodelta is completed 
although the mou executed by harvest vinccler and cvp in march provides that upon completion of the conversion there will be an adjustment between the parties to obtain the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed on april   this adjustment will not occur until the conversion is completed 
in  the conversion to petrodelta has progressed in a number of important areas in august  the mou was amended to provide for the addition of the isle o  temblador and el salto fields to petrodelta as additional consideration for our conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
the addition of these fields is subject to government approval 
in a special meeting of the stockholders in december  our stockholders approved entering into the transaction contemplated by the mou 
harvest vinccler has resolved and substantially paid all of the tax claims made by the seniat  the venezuelan income tax authority 
we continue to believe that harvest vinccler has properly paid all of its taxes  but we understand that resolving the income tax issues with the seniat is a necessary step in the transition of harvest vinccler s operations to petrodelta 
at the request of pdvsa  harvest vinccler invoiced pdvsa for million of advanced or accrued costs incurred during the last three quarters of  and million  representing the second and third quarter advances  have been reimbursed 
the fourth quarter advances of million were invoiced to pdvsa in february we have provided cvp with the business plan for the petrodelta properties 
our plan calls for the immediate resumption of the suspended development of the smu fields as well as appraisal and development of the isle o  temblador and el salto fields 
we are also actively working with cvp on staffing plans for petrodelta and have reached agreement on other elements of the conversion contract 
despite this progress  the conversion is not completed  and we can give no assurance with respect to the probability or the timing of completion 
the most significant matter to execution of the conversion contract and the formation of petrodelta is the receipt of approvals by the venezuelan government 
based on our ongoing discussions with venezuelan officials  we believe that these approvals will be received  but we cannot provide assurance when or if that will occur 
however  pdvsa has informed us that a number of other companies have signed their conversion contracts and formed the mixed companies 
moreover  we understand that three companies have completed the conversion process and are now in the position to invoice pdvsa for the crude oil produced since april  with the precedents established and issues resolved by the companies more advanced in the conversion process  we believe that companies such as harvest vinccler should be able to expedite the conversion process and the issuance of invoices for payment once we receive the government approvals 
certain operating statistics for the three and nine month periods ended december   for the smu fields operated by harvest vinccler are set forth below 
this information is provided at percent  without reduction for our interest under the osa or our ownership interest in petrodelta 
while we believe this information to be accurate  no representation is made with respect to what will be reflected in our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements after completing the conversion to petrodelta 
this information may not be representative of future results 
three months ended nine months ended december  december  oil production million barrels natural gas production billion cubic feet barrels of oil equivalent cash operating costs millions capital expenditures millions crude oil delivered from the smu fields to pdvsa will be priced with reference to merey published prices  weighted for different markets  and adjusted for variations in gravity and sulphur content  commercialization costs and distortions that may occur given the reference priced and prevailing market conditions 
crude oil prices that would be paid for the oil production if the conversion contract were in place cannot yet be calculated as several elements of the pricing formula have not been set 
market prices for crude oil of the type produced in the fields operated by harvest vinccler averaged approximately and a barrel for the three and nine months ended december   respectively 
the price for natural gas that would be paid under the conversion contract is per thousand cubic feet 
in item business and item a risk factors  we discuss the situation in venezuela and how the actions of the venezuelan government have and continue to adversely affect our operations 
collectively  the events in venezuela  both actual and threatened  are having a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the situation in venezuela has also restricted our available cash and had a significant adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing to acquire and develop growth opportunities elsewhere 
until there is clarity and certainty over completion of the conversion to petrodelta  including the receipt of payment for prior crude oil and natural gas deliveries and the resumption of drilling operations  uncertainty over the future of our investment in venezuela will continue to affect our performance and limit our growth opportunities 
we continue to assess and consider alternatives for preserving value  including a possible sale or exchange of all or part of our interests in venezuela 
the alternatives available to us are limited and subject to a number of significant variables  including timing for the completion of conversion to petrodelta  the value to us of petrodelta s assets  governmental approvals and any tax consequences 
we recognize the need to diversify our asset base and that is the primary focus of our strategy 
we will use our available cash and future access to capital markets to build a diversified portfolio of assets in a number of countries that fit our strategic investment criteria 
we are pursuing opportunities in a number of areas including russia  the commonwealth of independent states  the middle east and asia 
in executing our business strategy  we will strive to maintain financial prudence and rigorous investment criteria  access capital markets  create a diversified portfolio of large assets  preserve our financial flexibility  use our experience  skills to acquire new projects  and keep our organizational capabilities in line with our rate of growth 
to accomplish our strategy  we intend to diversify our political risk acquire large oil and natural gas fields in a number of countries to diversify and reduce the overall political risk of our international investment portfolio 
seek operational and financial control we desire control of major decisions for development  production  staffing and financing for each project for a period of time sufficient for us to ensure maximum returns on investments 

table of contents establish a presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a presence in the countries and areas we operate through joint venture partners to facilitate stronger governmental and business relationships 
in addition  we use local personnel to help us take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we are willing to agree to minimum capital expenditures or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments to fulfill them over time under a prudent plan of development  allowing near term operating cash flow to help fund further investment  thereby limiting our maximum cash exposure 
we also seek to maximize available local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
provide technical expertise we believe there is an advantage in being able to provide geological  geophysical and engineering expertise beyond what many companies or countries possess internally 
in addition to our in house technical capabilities  in january we acquired a minority interest in a technical firm with significant experience in providing leading edge geophysical  geosciences and reservoir engineering services in many places in the world 
through this acquisition we have preferred access to these services 
limit exploration activities while our strategy does not focus on unexplored areas  we consider appropriate exploration opportunities that have large potential scale and the ability to manage risk without significant initial cost 
maintain a prudent financial plan we intend to maintain our financial flexibility by closely monitoring spending  holding sufficient cash reserves  minimizing the use of restricted cash  actively seeking opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of capital and increase our access to debt and equity markets 
results of operations we include the results of operations of harvest vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
effective april   our operations have been reflected under the equity method of accounting but our ability to recognize equity earnings for the producing operations in venezuela are subject to completion of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
there will be an adjustment between the parties to obtain the same economic result as if the conversion had been completed at that date 
the following discussion should be read with the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have presented selected expense items from our consolidated income statement as a percentage of revenue in the following table years ended december  operating expenses depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative taxes other than on income interest expense 
table of contents years ended and we reported a net loss of million  or diluted earnings per share  for compared with net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for total expenses and other non operating income expense year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease general and administrative contribution to science and technology fund account receivable write off on retroactive oil price adjustment taxes other than on income investment income and other interest expense net gain loss on exchange rates general and administrative expenses increased due to higher business development costs and employee related expenses 
taxes other than on income decreased due to the elimination of municipal taxes as a result of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
interest expense increased due to harvest vinccler s estimated liability for interest on the tax assessments of million as well as increased borrowings to pay the tax assessments 
in  venezuela modified the science and technology law to require companies doing business in venezuela to invest  contribute  or spend a percentage of their gross revenue on projects to promote inventions or investigate technology in areas deemed critical to venezuela 
harvest vinccler was unable to estimate the corresponding percentage of the gross revenue for or the first quarter of until the regulations were released as many aspects of the law were unclear 
in october  the executive branch of the venezuelan government issued the regulations for the science and technology law which established the methodology for determining the required investment  contribution or expenditure for the calendar year financial results 
after release of the regulations  harvest vinccler accrued million for the estimated liability for and the first quarter of based on its current understanding of the regulations 
years ended and we reported net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for compared with net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for below is a discussion of revenues  price and volume variances 
year ended december  increase increase in millions decrease decrease increase revenues crude oil natural gas total revenues the following table reconciles the net change in revenue price and volume variances crude oil price variance per bbl volume variances crude oil volumes mbbls natural gas volumes mmcf total volume variances 
table of contents revenue  crude oil price variance and volume variances revenues were higher in compared with due to increases in world crude oil prices and oil volumes as a result of our second half drilling program 
price variance is net of the cost of hedges in place during natural gas delivery volumes declined due to the refusal of mep and pdvsa to issue permits for the drilling of new oil wells and the natural decline of associated natural gas from existing oil wells 
all natural gas deliveries are associated with the uracoa oil wells 
total expenses and other non operating income expense year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease operating expenses depletion and amortization depreciation general and administrative account receivable write off on retroactive oil price adjustment gain on sale of long lived assets bad debt recovery taxes other than on income investment income and other interest expense net gain loss on exchange rates operating expenses increased as a result of higher oil volumes and maintenance work 
depletion and amortization expense per boe produced during was versus in the increase was due to the exclusion of contractually restricted reserves in our proved reserves as well as other minor revisions 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to penalties accrued for the failure to withhold the prescribed amount of value added taxes from payments to vendors in venezuela in taxes other than on income increased due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes which result from higher oil revenues 
the effective tax rate increased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the payment of million related to a partial settlement of the through preliminary tax assessment 
capital resources and liquidity while we can give no assurance  we currently believe that our cash on hand will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our business development expenditures and semi annual interest payment obligations for the next twelve months 
in item a risk factors  we discuss a number of variables and risks related to venezuela that could cause actual results to differ materially and significantly affect our capital resources and liquidity 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to  the affects of continued delays in the conversion to petrodelta  delays or inability of pdvsa to pay for past and future crude oil and natural gas deliveries  the ability to implement our business plan  changes in oil prices  fiscal and contractual stability and expropriation of our assets 
we also point out that the total capital required to develop the fields in venezuela may exceed harvest vinccler s available cash and financing capabilities  and that there may be operational or contractual consequences to this inability 
in addition  our ability to acquire and develop growth opportunities outside of venezuela is dependent upon the ability to receive dividends from petrodelta and access debt and equity markets 
the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see item a risk factors 
we require capital principally to fund the acquisition and development of new oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of capital resource and liquidity growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures 

table of contents on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
the bolivar is not readily convertible into the us dollar 
we do not expect the venezuelan currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet short term loan obligations and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to acquire and develop growth opportunities outside of venezuela is dependent upon the ability to receive dividends from petrodelta and access debt and equity markets 
debt reduction 
we have semi annual principal obligations of and million on the harvest vinccler loans 
we have no other debt obligations 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the conversion to petrodelta and the ability of petrodelta to declare dividends 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in working capital of million and a current ratio of this compares with a working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the decrease in working capital of million was primarily due to the inability to reflect the net results of our producing operations in venezuela in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the charge in the second and third quarters of million for additional taxes and related interest for the impact of income tax assessments by the seniat for through first quarter cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the million decrease was primarily due to the collection of the first quarter accrued oil and gas sales receivable which was offset by the charge in the second and third quarters for the estimated tax assessments and related interest  as well as our inability to recognize equity earnings for our producing properties in venezuela beginning with the second quarter of under the equity method of accounting pending conversion to petrodelta 
cash flow from investing activities 
during the year ended december   we had limited workover and production related expenditures and we deposited cash of million as collateral for four loans with venezuelan banks  of which million has been returned to us 
during the year ended december   we had drilling workover and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and no restricted cash 
the decrease in capital expenditures is due to the continued suspension of our drilling program and the fact that the conversion of the osa to petrodelta has not been finalized 
the increase in restricted cash is due to collateral for the new borrowings to pay the tax assessments received from the seniat and to fund operations 
we continue to expend funds during the period prior to the conversion for workovers and maintenance of the existing wells 
after the conversion to petrodelta  our capital commitments will be determined by the business plan provided for in the conversion contract and the annual budget approved by the petrodelta board of directors to implement the business plan 
outside of venezuela  our capital commitments support our business development efforts and are substantially at our discretion 

table of contents cash flow from financing activities 
during the year ended december   harvest vinccler borrowed billion bolivars approximately million for short term bolivar denominated obligations  billion bolivars approximately million and billion bolivars approximately million for the seniat income tax assessments and related interest and billion bolivars approximately million for the seniat income tax assessments and related interest  to refinance previous borrowings and for operational needs 
also during the year ended december   harvest vinccler repaid million of its us dollar debt one payment of million and four payments of million each on the variable rate loans and billion bolivars approximately million of its bolivar debt 
during the year ended december   harvest vinccler repaid million of its us dollar denominated debt four payments of million each and four payments of million each on the variable rate loans 
contractual obligations we have a lease obligation of approximately  per month for our houston office space 
this lease runs through april in addition  harvest vinccler has lease obligations for office space in maturin and caracas  venezuela for approximately  and  per month  respectively 
payments in thousands due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt building lease total effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
fluctuations in oil prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
as noted above under capital resources and liquidity  venezuela imposed currency exchange restrictions in february  and adjusted the official exchange rate in february and again in march we do not expect the currency conversion restrictions or the adjustment in the exchange rate to have a material impact on us at this time 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor with respect to results of operations in venezuela 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange gain attributable to our international operations was million 
the us dollar and bolivar exchange rates were adjusted in march no gains or losses were recognized from february to february however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan currency to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investment in equity affiliate effective april   our activities under our osa are reflected under the equity method of accounting 
since such activities are subject to the completion of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta  our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap for the year ended december   do not reflect the 
table of contents net results of our producing operations in venezuela for the last three quarters of the year 
we will not be able to include the results of our venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements until the conversion to petrodelta is completed 
property and equipment we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties with costs accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as incurred  including exploration overhead 
only overhead that is directly identified with acquisition  exploration or development activities is capitalized 
all costs related to production  general corporate overhead and similar activities are expensed as incurred 
the costs for china unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
at least annually  we evaluate our unproved property for possible impairment 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in china where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration and acquisition costs associated with the country will be expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
foreign currency our current operations are in venezuela 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency 
amounts denominated in non us currencies are re measured in us dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
we attempt to manage our operations in such a manner as to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors that affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the bolivar to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange risk  as discussed below 
oil prices as an independent oil producer  our revenue  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
in august and september  harvest vinccler hedged a portion of its oil sales for calendar year by purchasing two wti crude oil puts 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
see note derivatives and hedging for a complete discussion of our derivative activity 
we had no hedging transactions in place for our or production 
interest rates total short term debt at december  of million consisted of harvest vinccler s bolivar denominated debt  which had a fixed rate for its initial twelve months 
total short term debt at december  of million consisted of harvest vinccler us dollar denominated variable rate loans  which was all repaid in a hypothetical percent adverse change in the interest rate would not have a material affect on our results of operations 
foreign exchange 
table of contents the bolivar is not readily convertible into the us dollar 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in venezuela  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in that country 
venezuela has recently imposed currency exchange controls see capital resources and liquidity above
