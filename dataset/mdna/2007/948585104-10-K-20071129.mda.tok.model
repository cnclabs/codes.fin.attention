the fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to august fiscal years  and contained weeks 
all references herein to  and  refer to the fiscal years ending august   september   and september   respectively 
our fiscal revenues increased  or  to  from  in fiscal our net loss for the year ended decreased  to  or per share  from  or per share for the year ended september  during the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million in new orders were received 
new orders included a new agreement with mega hertz granting them exclusive distributor status for products sold to domestic cable operators 
the order is for our digital dtv signal processing equipment which provides digital processing of local hdtv signals and asi transport streams and for our unity satellite receivers 
shipments on this order began in fiscal and are scheduled to ship throughout fiscal and into fiscal in addition  we received an order from horizon christian fellowship s horizon broadcast network for file based radio distribution equipment which includes compel network control  mediaplan content management and ipump professional audio servers 
the equipment was used to support the launch of a new radio network aimed at serving an initial target domestic audience estimated at million 
other bookings included add on orders from existing customers for unity and unity satellite receivers 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we booked approximately million in new orders  including a million contract from ssl satellite store link  to install a digital signage network in mexico 
the contract includes ipump media servers  smd ip based peripheral decoders and compel network control to distribute and display information and advertisements dynamically to bank customers and employees in an initial application of  locations throughout mexico

index to financial statements approximately million and included an order for unity satellite receivers for use by the big ten network btn in a new cable network being distributed by fox cable networks and an additional order from mega hertz under their domestic cable distribution agreement 
btn  a national cable and satellite programming service dedicated to covering both the athletic and academic content of the big ten conference  began programming in august  with most programs being offered in hdtv 
current developments we are continuing to invest in new technologies utilizing mpeg h 
video compression and dvb s satellite modulation 
when used in combination  mpeg h 
compression and dvb s modulation reduce bandwidth utilization by about half  which allows present networks to reduce recurring operational costs significantly and allows the creation of new networks that were not viable with previously more expensive distribution alternatives 
alternately  our customers will be able to upgrade their video to high definition and increase its quality significantly while maintaining similar bandwidth utilization to their current mpeg standard definition offering 
the smd ip decoder and the unity enterprise media receiver are our first products with mpeg h 
technology  and we continue to explore other potential applications for the technology 
the unity enterprise media receiver was exhibited in june at the cable tec expo and is currently scheduled for deliveries in the first quarter of fiscal we expect the development of products utilizing mpeg h 
technology to continue throughout fiscal we believe that market demand for mpeg technology is very strong and will continue for many years in the future  as was the case with mpeg video compression 
the conversion of new business opportunities into firm orders depends on the availability of next generation products with mpeg and dvb s technologies 
we are extremely focused on the completion and additional development of these products 
in addition  internet protocol delivery of video is becoming more ubiquitous 
we have added the ability to distribute media files and compel control messages over an ip network or the internet to our ipump products 
this allows our customers to expand their store forward networks to locations where they cannot connect a satellite dish or where their satellite footprint does not reach  while still using a single compel control system to manage their operations 
we expect ip delivery to drive additional demand for our ipump products 
in addition  we have launched multiple networks with our smd decoder product for the digital signage market 
the smd accepts streaming video from the ipump  which can be high definition and either mpeg or mpeg the product is particularly interesting to digital signage networks where video quality is critical 
we believe digital signage is a growth market and we are continuing to invest in additional digital signage offerings with our products 
with our technology leadership in mpeg h 
video  dvb s satellite networks and digital media distribution  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future industry trends 
as we work to realize this potential  our board of directors has determined that we should examine potential means for further strengthening our strategic position and maximizing value for our shareholders 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the board of directors formed a committee of independent directors to explore strategic and financial alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
we retained near earth llc as our exclusive financial advisor in this evaluation process 
these strategic alternatives may include i technology licensing agreements  ii product development and marketing arrangements  joint ventures or strategic partnerships  iii strategic acquisitions  mergers or other business combinations  or iv the merger or sale of all or part of the company 
we are also evaluating various financing alternatives to unlock the market value of our headquarters and associated real estate to support our capital needs 
there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any specific transaction 
we do not expect to disclose further developments regarding the process until the completion of the strategic alternatives review and a decision by the board of directors regarding a transaction or course of action

no income tax benefits were recorded in fiscal and due to an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
at august   net deferred tax assets of  were fully reserved by a valuation allowance for the reasons set forth in the paragraph below 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are one of the most difficult pieces of negative evidence to overcome in the absence of sufficient existing orders and backlog versus forecasted future orders supporting a return to profitability 
additional orders and backlog are currently needed to return to profitability in fiscal our assessment in applying sfas no 
indicated that a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required as of august  and september  at august   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of  of which  expires in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal additionally  we had an alternative minimum tax credit of  and a state income tax credit of  expiring in fiscal  all of which were fully offset by the valuation allowance

federal and state tax expenses in fiscal included a fourth quarter noncash charge of  to provide a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the effect in fiscal was to reverse the benefits of net deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years financial statements 
these tax benefits  as well as the subsequent fiscal year increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  will be available  prior to the expiration of carryforwards  to reduce future income tax expense resulting from earnings or increases in deferred tax liabilities

in such circumstances  among other things  risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods  the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them  and no additional performance obligations exist by us 
for these transactions  the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted 
for the year ended august   revenues to two customers in the amount of  were recorded prior to delivery as bill and hold transactions 
at august   accounts receivable for these revenues amounted to  of which  was paid subsequent to august  these policies require management  at the time of the transaction  to assess whether the amounts due are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future performance obligations exist 
these assessments are based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  past history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if management determines that collection is not reasonably assured or future performance obligations exist  revenue recognition is deferred until these conditions are satisfied 
our principal sources of revenues are from the sales of various satellite communications equipment 
embedded in our products is internally developed software of varying applications 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product

inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost at standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we make inventory reserve provisions to properly reflect inventory value based on a review of inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts  new products being developed and technology changes 
these reserves are to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
at august   inventories  net of reserve provisions  amounted to  capitalized software costs software development costs are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalized costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives  which could result in additional amortization expense or write offs 
at august   capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to  deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
as discussed in the results of operations section of this md a  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a  non cash income tax charge to establish a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets

compel s advanced receiver grouping techniques have been covered under a patent which expires on january  although no assurances may be given see item a 
risk factors section above  the expiration of the compel patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of products and market strategies 
in the cable and telecom headend market we believe that our brand and the competitive position for our products is strong 
competition for radio network products  including our digital audio products  is aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
competition in the private network market is often different by vertical industry and requires unique sales and marketing efforts 
we believe that success in all of our markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
there may be fluctuations in our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by us 
we have invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
we purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales  given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
our inventory reserve of  at august   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving

no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should our sales efforts not be successful 
sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues  and that trend is expected to continue throughout fiscal and beyond 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  future revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
three customers accounted for of the backlog expected to ship during fiscal our gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any given period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
we are very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if revenues do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for our satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume  standardized production environment 
certain raw materials  video sub components and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from a single source or limited sources 
although we believe that all single source components are currently available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have made significant investments in capitalized software  principally related to digital audio and video products 
at august   capitalized software costs were  these costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological changes and frequent product introductions 
we expect to remain committed to research and development expenditures as required to compete effectively and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design for future products
