we distribute oxandrin primarily in the united states and sales of oxandrin outside of the united states have historically been minimal 
our drug development activities puricase puricase is a recombinant porcine urate oxidase uricase that has been modified by the attachment of polyethylene glycol peg polymer chains 
puricase is currently in clinical development for the control of elevated levels of uric acid in the blood  or hyperuricemia  in patients with symptomatic gout in whom conventional treatment is contraindicated or has been shown to be ineffective 
gout develops when uric acid accumulates in the tissues and joints as a result of elevation of blood concentration of uric acid persisting for years to decades 
gout is usually associated with bouts of severe joint pain and disability gout flares and 
table of contents tissue deposits of urate crystals gout tophi 
patients with severe gout have an associated increased risk of kidney failure  which may lead to life threatening complications 
uricase is an enzyme that is not naturally expressed in humans but is present in almost all other mammals 
uricase eliminates uric acid from the body by converting uric acid to allantoin  which is easily excreted by the kidney 
whereas uric acid is poorly soluble in blood and tends to precipitate when the blood concentration is too high  allantoin is easily soluble in blood and does not tend to form crystals in the body tissues or in urine 
we believe that treatment with uricase will eliminate uric acid in the blood and possibly eliminate tissue deposits of urate crystals by converting the uric acid to easily excreted allantoin 
in we conducted the first of two phase clinical trials at the duke university medical center  using subcutaneous delivery of puricase 
the results demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in uric acid levels but two of individuals participating in the study experienced allergic reactions such as hives or inflammation at the injection site 
therefore  the trial was terminated prematurely and the subcutaneous route was abandoned 
we completed a second phase clinical trial in in which puricase was administered intravenously 
as expected  an inverse relationship between plasma uric acid and blood level of puricase enzyme activity was demonstrated 
a minimum effective dose and a dose response plateau were identified in terms of plasma uric acid response from the first few hours after intravenous infusion and lasting to the end of the three week observation period 
in the phase intravenous trial no clinical allergic responses were observed  no infusion reactions were reported  and no adverse reactions were noted at the site of intravenous infusion 
in we conducted an open label  randomized  three month phase safety and efficacy clinical trial of puricase to determine an appropriate dose and dose regimen and to support further testing in pivotal registration studies phase 
there were trial participants in this trial 
the results of the study confirmed and extended the single dose data obtained in phase  again showing a minimum effective dose and a dose response plateau  in terms of plasma uric acid normalization 
the most important and most common adverse events observed in the phase trial were associated with infusion reactions 
infusion reactions are adverse events occurring around the time of dose administration and are typical of biological drugs administered by intravenous infusion 
characteristically  infusion reactions can be mitigated or avoided when the volume and duration of infusions are increased 
since the infusion volume and duration was reduced by half between phase and phase  it is anticipated that  by again increasing the volume and duration of infusion in phase  the number and severity of infusion reactions can be effectively reduced 
no other important safety issues have arisen from the phase data set 
in sum  the tolerability  safety  and efficacy profile of puricase observed in phase supported full development of the product in phase clinical trials 
in december  we administered the last patient dose in a phase clinical trial of puricase and completed the full analysis of the results of this study in april in may  we reported positive top line phase clinical trial results for puricase 
anecdotal photographic evidence of the eradication of gout tophi on the hands of two patients was obtained by one investigator 
as spontaneous regression of gout tophi has never been reported  this unexpected efficacy outcome was ascribed to puricase and became the basis for further formal evaluation in phase additionally  it was noted that the frequency of gout flares at the end of the three month phase study was only about half that anticipated for this severely symptomatic group of patients 
the results from the phase clinical trial showed that puricase showed effectiveness in reducing uric acid levels 
based on the results of our end of phase meeting with the fda and post meeting interactions  in december  we submitted a special protocol assessment spa of our phase protocols 
in march we received a written response from the fda reflecting the agency s agreement with the phase protocols 
in may  we announced that we had reached an agreement with the fda through a spa on the clinical trial protocol for phase trials  which commenced in the united states in may and phase patient dosing began in june subsequent to the patient dosing in the united states we commenced patient dosing in canada and mexico 
these trials consist of two replicate double blinded  placebo controlled studies of six months duration  each involving approximately hyperuricemic patients with symptomatic gout in whom conventional treatment is contraindicated or has been shown to be ineffective 
the primary efficacy endpoint of the phase studies will be the proportion of patients who achieve normalization of the plasma uric acid during month and month secondary efficacy endpoints will assess the treatment effect of puricase on the burden of gout tophi  the frequency of gout flares  the number of tender and swollen joints  
table of contents and improvement in patient reported outcomes 
all patients who complete the phase studies will be invited to participate in a follow on twelve month open label extension protocol 
the registration data set is expected to include the six month placebo controlled data as well as available safety data from the open label extension trial at the time of dossier preparation  and data from all early clinical development trials 
patient recruitment for phase clinical trials was completed in march subject to successful completion of the phase trials  we are targeting to file a bla for puricase with the fda in early and expect an fda action date by early puricase received orphan drug designation by the fda in orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process  however  it does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and specific tax credits in the united states 
generally  if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
in such a case  later applications to market a competing drug of the same class for the same orphan indication may not be approved in the united states for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances 
however  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  including  for example  any showing that it is safer  more effective or an improvement to patient care  such as improved tolerance or reduced infusion reactions  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained would not block the approval of the competitive product 
manufacturing  supply and distribution arrangements oxandrin through march  gd searle llc searle  a subsidiary of pfizer inc  manufactured and supplied our requirements of oxandrolone  which is the active ingredient in oxandrin  pursuant to the terms of a manufacturing agreement which expired at that time 
pursuant to the terms of the expired agreement  the final shipment of oxandrolone manufactured by searle was received by us in the first half of additionally  under the terms of the expired agreement  searle has agreed not to produce oxandrolone for any other entity prior to october dsm pharmaceuticals  inc manufactures mg and mg oxandrin tablets for us from the oxandrolone bulk supplied by searle 
we also have an alternative supply agreement with gedeon richter ltd  pursuant to which gedeon richter will supply oxandrolone to us on an exclusive basis if we meet specified annual minimum purchase requirements 
we believe that the final shipment received from searle in the first half of  when combined with our existing inventory of oxandrolone and our new source of supply from gedeon richter  will be in excess of our requirements for the oxandrin brand tablets and our authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets through at least as with all our commercial agreements  we continually review our commercial needs against our contractual commitments in order to ascertain whether adjustments to such commitments are required 
at the present time  given the recent introduction of generic forms of oxandrolone tablets by competitors  we are engaged in discussions with gedeon richter in order to mutually agree to reductions to our supply agreement to bring it in line with the current view of the market needs for oxandrin brand and authorized generic tablets 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a change in this agreement on terms that are acceptable to either party 
oxandrolone in june  we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with watson pharmaceuticals  inc watson granting it exclusive us distribution rights to our authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets  an oxandrin brand equivalent product  which will be manufactured and supplied to watson through us 
performance under this agreement would occur only upon the launch of generic competition to oxandrin by third parties 
in december  we authorized watson to distribute our authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets 
the distribution agreement with watson has an initial year term and may be terminated  among other customary reasons  by either party with one year s prior notice 

table of contents puricase we have entered into an arrangement with our former global biologics manufacturing business  btg israel  to serve as the initial primary active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturer for our product candidate  puricase  for the remaining clinical development program and for initial commercial supply of product  as well as to provide the regulatory support required of a contract manufacturer with respect to the biologics license application bla filing that will be necessary for the approval of the product 
all clinical supplies of puricase required for the completion of our phase clinical trials and the open label extension clinical study are manufactured and packaged and are being stored and distributed by a facility located in the united states 
we are also in the process of concluding our efforts to identify and contract with a secondary source of supply of puricase  planning for late to initiate transfer of technology to such secondary supplier with the cooperation of btg israel and separately concluding a long term supply agreement with the suppliers of key active ingredients for the product 
we believe that our current arrangements for the supply of clinical and commercial quantities are adequate to complete our clinical development program and to satisfy our preliminary forecasted commercial requirements for puricase upon its approval 
we also entered into an exclusive royalty bearing license agreement with mountain view pharmaceuticals  inc and duke university granting us rights to certain patents and pending patent applications directed to pegylated urate oxidase  as well as methods for making and using such uricases  and to make  use and sell such products 
we also have the exclusive license to puricase  a registered trademark of mountain view pharmaceuticals 
the license agreement shall remain in effect  on a country by country basis  for the longer of ten years from the date of first sale of puricase in each country  or the date of expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the agreement  in each country 
the agreement may be terminated for customary reasons prior to such time and may be terminated at our option with six months prior notice 
sales and distribution during we manufactured and sold oxandrin in the united states 
prior to  we engaged one distributor to fulfill orders and invoice drug wholesaler customers on our behalf 
in we replaced that sole distributor with integrated commercialization services  inc ics 
our sales to three drug wholesaler customers  cardinal health  amerisourcebergen corp 
the parent of ics and mckesson corp  as a percent of our total gross sales related to continuing operations were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december we began selling oxandrolone to watson for distribution in the united states 
research and development our research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
prior to the sale of our former global biologics manufacturing business in july  we had received financial grants in support of research and development from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel for the development of puricase 
these grants from the office of chief scientist of the state of israel are subject to repayment through a royalty on the commercial sales of puricase when they commence 
since the sale of our former global biologics manufacturing business in july  we no longer internally conduct discovery scientific research on potential products 
instead  our efforts focus on the clinical development of puricase for which we have commercialization rights exclusively licensed 
governmental regulation regulatory compliance regulation by united states and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor affecting our ability to commercialize our products  the timing of such commercialization  and our ongoing research and development activities 
all of our products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
various laws and regulations govern or influence the research and development  
table of contents manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of our products 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations  require expending substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain or maintain  or any delay in obtaining or maintaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products require prior approval from the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  these procedures include pre clinical studies  the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  human clinical trials and filing and approval of either a new drug application  or nda  for chemical pharmaceutical products  or a bla for biological pharmaceutical products 
the results of pre clinical testing  which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations  and details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls  must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can begin 
an ind becomes effective days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials outlined in the ind 
if the fda has comments or questions  these must be resolved to the satisfaction of the fda before clinical trials can begin 
in addition  the fda may  at any time  impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
typically  clinical testing involves a three phase process phase clinical trials are conducted in a small number of volunteers or patients to assess the early tolerability and safety profile  and the pattern of drug absorption  distribution and metabolism  phase clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population afflicted with a specific disease in order to assess appropriate dosages and dose regimens  expand evidence of the safety profile and evaluate preliminary efficacy  and phase larger scale  multicenter  well controlled clinical trials are conducted on patients with a specific disease to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval  as required by the fda 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing and chemistry  manufacturing and controls are then submitted to the fda in the form of either an nda or bla for review and potential approval to commence commercial sales 
in responding to an nda or bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information in an approvable letter or deny the approval if it determines that the nda or bla does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
an approvable letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda or bla 
if and when those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will typically issue an approval letter  which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications 
any approval required by the fda might not be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
among the conditions for an nda or bla approval is the requirement that the manufacturing and quality control  some specific non clinical toxicology studies and some laboratory tests  and clinical studies conform on an ongoing basis with current good manufacturing practices cgmp  good laboratory practices glp  and good clinical practices cgcp 
in complying with cgmp  glp and cgcp  we must expend time  money and effort in the areas of training  production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing laboratories and clinical trial partners 
following approval of the nda or bla  we and our third party manufacturers remain subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
we also face similar inspections coordinated by the european medicines agency  or emea  by inspectors from particular european union  or eu  member states that conduct inspections on behalf of the eu and from other foreign regulatory authorities 
any determination by the fda or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing deficiencies could materially adversely affect our business 
regulatory requirements and approval processes in eu countries are similar in principle to those in the united states and can be at least as costly and uncertain 
the eu has established a unified centralized filing 
table of contents and approval system administered by the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp and designed to reduce the administrative burden of processing applications for pharmaceutical products derived from new technologies 
in addition to obtaining regulatory approval of products  it is generally necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the facility in which the product will be manufactured 
we use and plan to continue to use third party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities 
future fda inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
in addition  discovery of problems with a product  including new safety risks  or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product  manufacturer or holder of an approved nda or bla  including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or fda initiated action that could delay further marketing 
newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product s approved labeling  including the addition of new warnings and contraindications 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
once an nda or bla is approved  a product will be subject to certain post approval requirements  including requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports to the fda 
in addition  the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics 
in particular  a drug or biologic may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the fda as reflected in the product s approved labeling 
the fda also requires substantiation of any claims of superiority of one product over another  including that such claims be proven by adequate and well controlled head to head clinical trials 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  clinical  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research and development activities 
pricing controls the levels of revenues and profitability of biopharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing reimbursement or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the united states there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
for example  the passage of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs which affect the marketing of our products 
the subsequent medicare part d prescription program that went into effect january  is currently providing prescription coverage to approximately million people with an estimated cost of billion through  creating additional pressures on product pricing 
patents and proprietary rights our scientific staff  contract manufacturing partners and consultants continually work to develop proprietary techniques  processes and products 
we protect our intellectual property rights in this work by a variety of means  including assignments of inventions from our scientific staff  contract manufacturing partners and consultants  and filing patent and trademark applications in the united states  europe and other major industrialized countries 
we also rely upon trade secrets and improvements  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our products are sold under brand name  logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance 
as of march   we maintained worldwide approximately issued patents either owned or exclusively licensed by us  including patents issued in the united states 
additionally  approximately patent applications owned or exclusively licensed by us are pending in various countries 
however  our patent 
table of contents applications might not result in issued patents and issued patents might be circumvented or invalidated 
the expiration or loss of patent protection resulting from legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short time 
we believe that important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of patent protection  and we expect that in certain cases litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of our and others proprietary rights 
such litigation may consume substantial amounts of our resources 
we are aware of patents and patent applications issued to and filed by other companies with respect to technology that is potentially useful to us and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by us 
we cannot currently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
in the aggregate  our patent and related rights are of material importance to our business 
the following is the intellectual property status for our principal products and product candidates oxandrin and oxandrolone we have been granted several united states patents directed to the use of oxandrolone in the treatment of wounds  burns  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and in ameliorating muscle weakness and wasting in hiv positive patients 
these patents and patent applications would expire between and we also have registered oxandrin as a trademark in the united states 
puricase we have exclusively licensed from mountain view pharmaceuticals and duke university certain patents and pending patent applications directed to pegylated urate oxidase  as well as methods for making and using such uricases  and have jointly filed a patent application with duke university directed to administration of pegylated urate oxidase 
these patents and patent applications  if issued  would expire between and mountain view pharmaceuticals has registered the puricase trademark  which we have exclusively licensed 
we have also filed patent applications directed to urate exidase  the resulting patents of which we would be the sole owner of 
competition in general  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
the technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
competition from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions is intense and we expect it to increase 
many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources  research and development capabilities and experience and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial  marketing and other resources available to these competitors 
an important factor in our ability to compete will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we and competing companies can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success 
other significant competitive factors include capabilities of our collaborators  product safety and efficacy  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  marketing and sales capabilities  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  the amount of clinical benefits and side effects of our products relative to their cost  the method of administering a product  
table of contents price  and patent protection 
in the united states  oxandrin competes against several other anabolic agents and appetite stimulants  and other oxandrolone generics in addition to our authorized generic brand equivalent product 
each of these products has different strategies and resources allocated to its promotion as compared to oxandrin and our authorized generic brand equivalent product 
if and when commercialized  puricase will be launched in the gout treatment failure population  an indication for which there is currently no product commercially available 
products used to treat the symptoms of gout  such as gout flares and synovitis  could be used concomitantly in patients also using puricase  as long as symptoms and signs of the disease persist 
other uric acid lowering therapies  such as probenecid  oxypurinol  and allopurinol  have not been tested for use in combination with puricase 
employees as of march   we had employees 
all employees are located in the united states 
there are employees engaged in research and development activities including clinical  regulatory  quality assurance and control  and manufacturing or production activities  employees are engaged in general and administrative activities including executive  finance  tax  legal  human resources  internal audit  investor relations  technology  and operations  and employees are engaged in sales and marketing activities including business development  commercial operations  sales operations and marketing

item a 
risk factors our annual report on form k contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements that set forth anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward looking statements 
such statements discuss our strategy  expected future financial position  results of operations  cash flows  financing plans  development of products  strategic alliances  intellectual property  competitive position  plans and objectives of management 
we often use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  will and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
in particular  the statements regarding our new strategic direction and its potential effects on our business and the development of our lead drug candidate puricase are forward looking statements 
additionally  forward looking statements include those relating to future actions  prospective products or product approvals  future performance  financing needs  liquidity or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated  estimated or projected 
you should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements 
we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses 
these are important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
risks relating to our strategic direction we have repositioned our company to focus on product development  particularly puricase 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize this product candidate or any other product candidate that we may pursue in the future  or if we experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so  our business will be materially harmed 
much of our near term results will depend on our successfully completing clinical testing of puricase and  if successful  commercial launch of this product 
in december  we administered the last patient dose in a phase clinical trial of puricase and we completed the full analysis of the results of this study in april in may  we reported positive top line phase clinical trial results for puricase 
the results from the phase clinical trial showed that puricase showed effectiveness in reducing uric acid levels 
based on the 
table of contents results of our end of phase meeting with the fda and post meeting interactions  in december  we submitted a special protocol assessment  or spa  of our phase protocols 
in march  we received a written response from the fda reflecting the agency s agreement with the phase protocols 
on may   we announced we had received written notification from the fda that the spa was approved 
we have implemented the protocols in support of a marketing application for the orphan drug indication of the control of hyperuricemia in patients with symptomatic gout in whom conventional treatment is contraindicated or has been shown to be ineffective 
although we may determine to enter certain markets outside of the united states ourselves  we are concentrating our business development efforts principally on identifying and entering into a transaction with a partner for the clinical development and commercialization of puricase outside of the united states 
moreover  we continue to identify and evaluate late stage compounds and technologies for possible in licensing or partnering transactions in certain specialty areas as part of our business strategy 
our ability to commercialize puricase or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future will depend on several factors  including successfully completing clinical trials  successfully partnering to manufacture fully comparable clinical and commercial drug supplies  receiving marking approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities  establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers  launching commercial sales of the product  whether alone or in collaboration with others  and acceptance of the product in the medical community and with third party payors and consumers 
there is no guarantee that we will successfully accomplish any of the above factors  and our inability to do so may result in significant delays  unanticipated costs or the failure of the clinical development and commercialization of puricase  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
we will face similar drug development risks for any other product candidates that we may develop in the future 
our ability to engage in in licensing or partnering transactions in certain specialty areas in the future will depend on several factors  including identifying products that fit within our product portfolio  and successfully competing for early and late stage development products 
there is no guarantee that we will successfully accomplish any of the above factors  and our inability to do so may result in our not fully or partially implementing our business strategy  which may have a material adverse affect on our business 

table of contents puricase  and any other product candidate that we may develop in the future  must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before it can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy clinical trials and extensive manufacturing quality assessments to obtain regulatory approval 
we must successfully complete clinical trials for puricase before we can apply for its marketing approval 
completion of our clinical trials does not assure fda approval 
we began phase patient dosing in june the phase clinical trials are being conducted in the united states  canada and mexico 
our phase trials may be unsuccessful which would materially harm our business 
even if these trials are successful  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or additional manufacturing quality assessments before a biologics license agreement  or bla  can be filed with the fda for marketing approval or as a condition of approval 
clinical testing is expensive  is difficult to design and implement  can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome 
success in early phases of clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results 
a failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize puricase  including regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results  and we may decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising  enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we currently anticipate  or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at higher rates than we currently anticipate  we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold  suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons  including noncompliance with regulatory requirements  the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate  we may encounter difficulties or delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of product candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials  any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions  and the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics 
additionally  we  along with our third party manufacturers and collaborators  may not employ  in any capacity  persons who have been debarred under the fda s application integrity policy 
employment of such a debarred person even if inadvertently may result in delays in fda review or approval of our products  or the rejection of data developed with the involvement of such person s 
if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate  if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive  we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates  not be able to obtain marketing approval  obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended  or 
table of contents not obtain marketing approval before other companies are able to bring competitive products to market 
our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals 
we do not know whether our ongoing clinical trials will be completed on schedule 
similarly  we do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned or will need to be restructured  if at all 
significant delays in clinical trials could also allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials of puricase and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials 
we do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidate  puricase 
we rely on third parties  such as contract research organizations  clinical data management organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators  to perform this function 
our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities 
we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial 
moreover  the fda requires us and third parties acting on our behalf to comply with standards  commonly referred to as good clinical practices  for conducting  recording  and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights  integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected 
our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements 
furthermore  these third parties may also have relationships with other entities  some of which may be our competitors 
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties  meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols  we may not be able to obtain  or may be delayed in obtaining  regulatory approvals for puricase and may not be able to  or may be delayed in our efforts to  successfully commercialize puricase 
we also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of puricase or commercialization of puricase  producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue 
our strategic focus includes a licensing initiative to partner our puricase product candidate outside the united states 
we may not be successful in our efforts to partner our puricase product candidate 
although we may determine to enter certain markets outside of the united states ourselves  we are seeking a development and commercialization partner for puricase outside the united states as part of our strategic business plan 
to date  we have had limited success in identifying a suitable partner outside the united states  and we may continue to have difficulty in this area for a number of reasons 
in particular  the licensing and partnering of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area 
numerous companies are also pursuing strategies to license and partner products similar to those that we are pursuing 
these companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size  cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities 
our strategic focus includes an initiative to in license or partner other novel compounds to build our development portfolio 
we may not be successful in our efforts to expand our portfolio of products in this manner 
as part of our strategic business plan  we are seeking an active in licensing or partnering program to access and develop novel compounds in later clinical development 
to date  we have not found a suitable partner outside the united states  and we may continue to have difficulty in this area for a number of reasons 
in particular  the licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area 
numerous companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products similar to those that we are pursuing 
these companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size  cash resources and greater 
table of contents clinical development and commercialization capabilities 
other factors that may prevent us from partnering  licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable product candidates include the following we may be unable to identify suitable products or product candidates within our areas of expertise  we may be unable to license or acquire the relevant technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment in the product  or companies that perceive us to be their competitors may be unwilling to assign or license their product rights to us 
if we are unable to develop suitable potential product candidates by obtaining rights to novel compounds from third parties  our business could suffer 
the full development and commercialization of our development drug products and execution of our strategic business plan will require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain such capital 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products requires substantial funds 
in addition  we may require cash to acquire new product candidates and to fully execute on our strategic business plan 
in recent periods  we have satisfied our cash requirements primarily through product sales  the divestiture of assets that are not core to our strategic business plan and the monetization of underperforming investments 
historically  we have also obtained capital through collaborations with third parties  contract fees  government funding and equity and debt financings 
these financing alternatives might not be available in the future to satisfy our cash requirements 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding may be on unacceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  we may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to take specified actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our commercialization efforts or development programs or obtain funds through sales of assets or arrangements with collaborative partners or others on less favorable terms than might otherwise be available 
risks related to our business we incurred an operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended and anticipate that we may incur operating losses from continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to commercialize puricase or any other product candidates  we may never achieve operating profitability 
since  we have incurred substantial operating losses from continuing operations 
our operating loss from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our operating losses from continuing operations have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities  including clinical trials  and from general and administrative expenses associated with our operations 
we expect to continue to incur substantial  and even increasing  operating losses from continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
our continuing operations financial results have been substantially dependent on oxandrin sales 
sales of oxandrin accounted for   and of our continuing net product sales in the years ended   and  respectively 
moreover  we expect that our revenues will decline significantly  and our results of operations will be materially adversely affected as the fda has approved generic versions of oxandrin in december which are currently on the market 
in addition  our consolidated net income from and and positive cash flow was substantially attributable to the operating results of rosemont and the gain on disposition of rosemont which are included in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 

table of contents our ability to generate operating profits is dependent on the completion of development and successful commercialization of puricase and any other product candidates that we may develop  license  partner or acquire 
if we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize puricase or any other product candidates  or if we experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so  or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives marketing approval is insufficient  we may never achieve operating profitability 
even if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
a significant portion of our revenues was attributable to sales of oxandrin in the launch of generic competition to oxandrin will likely cause a significant decrease in oxandrin sales in and future years and may render our existing oxandrin inventory obsolete 
in addition  oxandrin sales in particular reporting periods may be affected by wholesalers buying patterns and product returns 
future returns of oxandrin  our authorized generic of oxandrin or other products could also affect our results of operations 
our sales of oxandrin in the united states are principally to three major drug wholesalers 
these sales are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of these wholesalers and the corresponding changes in inventory levels that they maintain 
in the past  wholesalers have reduced their inventories of oxandrin and we expect that wholesalers will continue to reduce inventories as a result of generic competition of oxandrin 
generic competition for oxandrin began in december following the denial by the court of appeals for the federal circuit of our motion for a stay pending appeal from the district court s denial of injunctive relief in connection with our lawsuit against sandoz pharmaceuticals and upsher smith laboratories for infringement of our patents related to various methods of using oxandrin oxandrolone 
moreover  we may face additional generic competition from barr laboratories  inc barr which filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture  use or sale of specified dosages of oxandrolone tablets prior to expiration of our patents 
in february  barr notified us that it amended its anda to carve out of its proposed labeling uses for the generic oxandrolone tablet that would infringe our issued use patents 
as a result  we have agreed to dismiss the action without prejudice 
the introduction of generic forms of oxandrin on the market by two competitors  and the possible introduction by a third competitor  will negatively affect our results of operations and may render our existing oxandrin inventory obsolete 
net sales of oxandrin were million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively  representing approximately   and of our continuing net product sales  respectively 
we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
in addition to the expected impact of generic competition  some states  including new york  california and florida  have eliminated or limited reimbursement of prescription drugs for hiv and aids  including oxandrin and oxandrolone  under their aids drug assistance programs adap or via their state medicaid programs 
there can be no assurances that other state formularies will delete oxandrin 
in addition  the implementation of the medicare part d program has created disruption in the market as patients switch to a variety of new prescription coverage programs in all states across the united states 
we have considered the demand deterioration as part of our estimates into our product return  however our demand forecasts are based upon management s best estimates 
as of december  and  our allowance for product returns was million and million  respectively 
future product returns in excess of our historical reserves could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 
if third parties on which we rely for distribution of our generic version of oxandrolone do not perform as contractually required or as we expect  our results of operations may be harmed 
we do not have the ability to independently distribute our generic version of oxandrolone tablets 
in response to the generic competition that oxandrin experienced in december  we immediately launched  through our distribution partner  watson pharmaceuticals  a generic version of oxandrolone tables  usp c iii  an oxandrin brand equivalent product manufactured and supplied by us 
we depend on watson to distribute this product for us  and we have a supply and distribution agreement with watson 
we do not control 
table of contents many aspects of watson s activities 
if watson fails to carry out its obligations  does not devote sufficient resources to the distribution of oxandrolone  or does not carry out its responsibilities in the manner we expect  our generic version of oxandrolone may not compete successfully against other generics of oxandrolone  and our results of operations could be harmed 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
our competitors may develop alternative technologies or safer or more effective products before we are able to do so 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
the technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
our future success will depend upon our ability to compete in the research  development and commercialization of products and technologies in our areas of focus 
competition from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions is intense and we expect it to increase 
many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources  research and development capabilities and experience and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial  marketing and other resources available to these competitors 
rapid technological development may result in our product candidates in development becoming obsolete before we can begin marketing these product candidates or before we are able to recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred in the development of those products 
for example  since our launch of oxandrin  a significant portion of oxandrin sales has been for treatment of patients suffering from hiv related weight loss 
these patients needs for oxandrin have decreased as a result of the development of safer or more effective treatments  such as protease inhibitors 
in fact  since january  growth in the aids related weight loss market has slowed substantially and actually began to decline as a result of improved therapies to treat hiv related weight loss 
if and when commercialized  puricase will be launched in the gout treatment failure population  an indication for which there is currently no product commercially available 
products used to treat the symptoms of gout  such as gout flares and synovitis  could be used concomitantly in patients also using puricase  as long as symptoms and signs of the disease persist 
other uric acid lowering therapies  such as probenecid  oxypurinol  and allopurinol  have not been tested for use in combination with puricase 
our products must compete favorably to gain market acceptance and market share 
an important factor in determining how well our products compete is the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
for example  the most recent competitors to enter the oxandrolone market were sandoz and upsher smith with their introductions of generic oral products containing oxandrolone 
we expect these products  as well as our generic version of oxandrolone  to displace oxandrin 
additional competition also occurs with the entry of therapeutic options  for example  par pharmaceutical companies  inc par introduced megace es in june megase es is primarily displacing generic megace which represents of the involuntary weight loss market  but also has an effect on oxandrin sales 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we and competing companies can develop other products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success 
our competitors may develop safer  more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier product development completion  patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization than we do 
these companies also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and to attract third parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
our competitors achievement of any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
manufacturing our products requires us to meet stringent quality control standards 
in addition  we depend on third parties to manufacture our products and plan to rely on third parties to manufacture any future products 
if these third party suppliers  and particularly our sole source supplier for puricase  fail to 
table of contents supply us for any reason  our revenues and product development efforts may be materially adversely affected 
we depend on third parties for the supply of our products 
failure of any third party to meet applicable regulatory requirements may adversely affect our results of operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control 
the manufacture of our products involves a number of technical steps and requires our third party suppliers and manufacturers to meet stringent quality control and quality assurance specifications imposed by us or by governmental regulatory bodies 
in the event of a natural disaster  equipment failure  strike  war or other difficulty  our suppliers may be unable to manufacture our products in a manner necessary to fulfill demand 
our inability to fulfill market demand  or the inability of our third party manufacturers to meet our demands will have a direct and adverse impact on our sales and may also permit our licensees and distributors to terminate their agreements 
other risks involved with engaging third party suppliers include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality control assurance  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party or the inability of the third party to meet our production schedules because of factors beyond our control  such as shortages in qualified personnel  and the possibility of termination or non renewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
we rely on a single source supplier for the manufacture of our product candidate puricase and have a single source supplier of a key active ingredient contained in puricase with which we currently have no long term supply agreement 
in addition  we have entered into an arrangement with btg israel  to serve as the initial primary manufacturer of our product candidate  puricase 
the continued ability of btg israel to consistently perform manufacturing activities for us may be affected by economic  military and political conditions in israel and in the middle east in general 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and neighboring countries 
these hostilities have  at times  caused security and economic problems in israel 
the nature and scope of the technology transfer required to manufacture the product outside of btg israel make it unlikely that we will be able to identify sources of supply of puricase other than btg israel  prior to escalating hostilities involving israel could adversely affect btg israel s ability to supply adequate quantities of the product under our agreement and in turn affect our ability to complete the clinical development of puricase 
while we are seeking to identify additional secondary sources of supply of puricase and concluding a long term supply agreement with the supplier of the key active ingredients for the product  the completion of the process to successfully identify and reach agreement with such additional secondary source and the time to conduct a technology transfer to enable the secondary source to scale up and validate its manufacturing processes for puricase will be lengthy 
if we experience an interruption in the supply of puricase from btg israel or the active ingredients from other third party suppliers before we have succeeded in concluding long term supply arrangements and entering into and validating a secondary supply arrangement for puricase it may materially adversely affect our financial results  possibly materially 
the manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products are subject to the requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory bodies 
if we or our third party suppliers fail to satisfy these requirements  our business operations may be materially harmed 
the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated 
manufacturing activities must be conducted in accordance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices  and comparable requirements of foreign regulatory bodies 
failure by our third party suppliers to comply with applicable regulations  requirements  or guidelines could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory 
table of contents authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
other than by contract  we do not have control over the compliance by our third party suppliers with these regulations and standards 
changes in manufacturing processes or procedures  including changes in the location where an api or a finished product is manufactured or changes in a third party supplier may require prior fda or other governmental review or approval or revalidation of the manufacturing process 
this is particularly an issue with biologic products  such as our product candidate puricase 
this review or revalidation may be costly and time consuming 
because there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under applicable regulatory requirements  it may be difficult for us to change a third party supplier if we are otherwise required to do so 
we may not be successful in establishing strategic alliances  which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products and services 
part of our strategic plan to focus on product development involves entering into strategic alliances for the development and commercialization of products and services when we believe that doing so will maximize product value 
for example  we plan to seek development and commercial partners to commercialize puricase outside the united states 
if we are unsuccessful in reaching an agreement with a suitable collaborator or collaborators for our current or future product candidates  we may fail to meet our business objectives for the applicable product or program 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators 
moreover  these alliance arrangements are complex to negotiate and time consuming to document 
we may not be successful in our efforts to establish strategic alliances or other alternative arrangements 
the terms of any strategic alliances or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us 
moreover  such strategic alliances or other arrangements may not be successful 
the risks that we are likely to face in connection with any future strategic alliances include the following strategic alliance agreements are typically for fixed terms and are subject to termination under various circumstances  including  in many cases without cause  we may rely on collaborators to manufacture the products covered by our alliances  the areas of research  development and commercialization that we may pursue  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  may be limited as a result of non competition provisions of our strategic alliance agreements  and failure to establish steady supply of essential raw materials from vendors 
our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payors and a reduction in the payment or reimbursement rate could result in decreased use or sales of our products 
most patients rely on medicare and medicaid  private health insurers and other third party payors to pay for their medical needs  including any drugs we or our collaborators may market 
if third party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for any products that we may develop  our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer 
the united states congress enacted a limited prescription drug benefit for medicare recipients in the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of which was expanded by the medicare part d prescription plan that went into effect january  as a result  in some cases our prices are negotiated with drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries and are likely to be lower than if we did not participate in this program 
non medicare third party drug procurement organizations may also base the price they are willing to pay on the rate paid by drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries 

table of contents a primary trend in the united states healthcare industry is toward cost containment 
in addition  in some foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in these countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies 
the conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our products 
third party payors  states  and federally subsidized programs are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  and many third party payors  states  and federally subsidized programs consistently limit reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products  including oxandrin 
in particular  third party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products we may develop 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop  which would result in lower product revenues to us 
if we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates 
our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products will depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel and to establish and maintain continuity and stability within our management team 
there is a great deal of competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for the limited number of pharmaceutical development professionals with expertise in the areas of our activities 
we generally do not enter into employment agreements with any of our product development personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain  and have no current intention of obtaining  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
if we cannot continue to attract and retain  on acceptable terms  the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business and products  we may not be able to sustain our operations and execute our business plan 
we may incur substantial costs related to product liability 
the testing and marketing of our products entail an inherent risk of product liability and associated adverse publicity 
pharmaceutical product liability exposure could be extremely large and poses a material risk 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage in place  which is subject to coverage limits and deductibles 
we might not be able to maintain existing insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
it is possible that a single product liability claim could exceed our insurance coverage limits  and multiple claims are possible 
any successful product liability claim made against us could substantially reduce or eliminate any stockholders equity we may have and could materially harm our financial results 
product liability claims  regardless of their merit  could be costly and divert management s attention  and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
the ultimate outcome of pending securities litigation is uncertain 
after the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended december   and and the first two quarters of  we and some of our former officers were named in a series of similar purported securities class action lawsuits 
the complaints in these actions  which have been consolidated into one action  allege violations of us securities law through alleged material misrepresentations and omissions and seek an unspecified award of damages 
in august  citing the failure of the plaintiff s amended complaint to set forth particularized facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with the required state of mind  the district court granted our motion to dismiss the action  without prejudice  and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
in october the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint  again seeking unspecified compensatory damages  purporting to set forth particularized facts to support their allegations of violations of sections b and a of the exchange act by us and our former officers 
in december we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint which has now been fully briefed by both us and the 
table of contents plaintiffs and is pending a decision by the court 
on october   the district court granted our motion to dismiss  with prejudice  plaintiff s second amended complaint 
the district court declined to allow plaintiffs to file another amended complaint 
the plaintiffs have filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals for the third circuit  which is currently pending 
we intend to contest the appeal vigorously 
however  should the appeal prove successful and an adverse decision in this case is ultimately made  we could be adversely affected financially 
we have referred these claims to our directors and officers insurance carrier  which has reserved its rights as to coverage with respect to this action 
tax requirements and audits could impact our results of operations 
the company is subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions 
our results of operations could be materially affected with a change in tax law or in the interpretation of tax law 
this also includes the risk of changes in tax rates and the risk of failure to comply with procedures required by the taxing authorities 
failure to manage our tax strategies could lead to an additional tax charge 
we are currently under examination by various state taxing authorities for certain tax years 
any material disagreement with taxing authorities could result in cash expenditures and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to previous weaknesses in our internal controls we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
although these material weaknesses have been fully remediated we may experience additional material weaknesses in the future 
any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or our failure to remediate such material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements not being prevented or detected and could adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements  as well as our stock price 
we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
these material weaknesses have been fully remediated as described further in item a in this annual report on form k 
additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements not being prevented or detected and could harm investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our stock price and our ability to raise additional funds 
risks relating to intellectual property if we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties  we could lose license rights that are important to our business 
we intend to become a party to various license agreements 
we expect that our future licenses will impose various diligence  milestone payment  royalty  insurance and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license  in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products  the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the united states and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products 
the patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions 
we may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products 
even if issued  patents may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products 
generic forms of our product oxandrin are now being introduced  and as a result  our results of operations have been harmed 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection 

table of contents our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until months after filing  or in some cases not at all  and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know how  the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected 
in addition to patented technology  we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if our confidential information or trade secrets become publicly known  they may lose their value to us 
if we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  our business may be adversely affected 
our development and commercialization activities  as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to us and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by us 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators  we or they could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
this could harm our business significantly 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office or in another patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
in the future we may be involved in costly legal proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
litigation is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights 
legal proceedings that we initiate to protect our intellectual 
table of contents property rights could also result in counterclaims or countersuits against us 
any litigation  regardless of its outcome  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert our management s time and attention 
any intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions  including cease selling products or undertaking processes that are claimed to be infringing a third party s intellectual property  obtain licenses to make  use  sell  offer for sale or import the relevant technologies from the intellectual property s owner  which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign those products or processes that are claimed to be infringing a third party s intellectual property  or pursue legal remedies with third parties to enforce our indemnification rights  which may not adequately protect our interests 
we have been involved in several lawsuits and disputes regarding intellectual property in the past 
we could be involved in similar disputes or litigation with other third parties in the future 
an adverse decision in any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
regulatory risks we are subject to stringent governmental regulation  and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
virtually all aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the united states  such as the fda  as well as by foreign countries where we manufacture or distribute our products 
of particular significance are the requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  promotion and distribution of pharmaceutical products for human use 
all of our products  manufacturing processes and facilities require governmental licensing  registration or approval prior to commercial use  and maintenance of those approvals during commercialization 
our prescription pharmaceutical products cannot be marketed in the united states until they have been approved by the fda  and then can only be marketed for the indications and claims approved by the fda 
as a result of these requirements  the length of time  the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of an nda or a bla are substantial 
the approval process applicable to products of the type being developed by us usually takes many years from the commencement of human clinical trials and typically requires substantial expenditures 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our or their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our products  we are required to conduct pre clinical and clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe and efficacious for the treatment of the target indication 
the timing of completion of clinical trials depends on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in the policies of regulatory authorities 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  and mandate product withdrawals 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting our ability to commercialize our products  the timing of such commercialization  and our ongoing research and development activities 
the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  is not within our control 
failure to obtain and maintain requisite governmental approvals  or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested  could delay or preclude us from marketing our products  could limit the commercial use of the products and could also allow competitors time to introduce competing products ahead of product introductions by us 
even after regulatory approval is obtained  use of the products could reveal side effects that  if serious  could result in suspension of existing approvals and delays in obtaining approvals in other jurisdictions 

table of contents failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in significant fines or other sanctions  termination of clinical trials  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  imposition of operating restrictions  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
we or our employees might not be  or might fail to be  in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  all pharmaceutical product promotion and advertising activities are subject to stringent regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review 
violations of these regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties  and civil penalties which can include costly mandatory compliance programs and exclusion from federal healthcare programs 
further  fda policy or similar policies of regulatory agencies in other countries may change and additional governmental requirements may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
moreover  from time to time legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could also significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of drug and biologic products 
we cannot predict what effect changes in regulations  enforcement positions  statutes or legal interpretations  when and if promulgated  adopted or enacted  may have on our business in the future 
changes could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods or facilities  expanded or different labeling  new approvals  the recall  replacement or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded scientific substantiation requirements 
these changes  or new legislation  could adversely affect our business 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock our stock price is volatile  which could adversely affect your investment 
our stock price is volatile 
since january   our common stock had traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including our ability to successfully implement our strategic business plan  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of results in pre clinical testing and clinical trials  regulatory developments  patent or proprietary rights developments  public concern as to the safety or other implications of biotechnology products  changes in our earnings estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  period to period fluctuations in our financial results  and general economic  industry and market conditions 
the volatility of our common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on our stockholders than a less volatile stock would 
in addition  volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a stockholder s holdings of our common stock 
the stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have also experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
such litigation would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
our revenues and expenses have in the past and may in the future continue to display significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the amount and timing of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  including generic products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the timing and amount of expenses relating to sales and marketing  the timing and amount of expenses relating to general and administrative activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions 
because many of our expenses are fixed  particularly in the short term  any decrease in revenues will adversely affect our earnings until revenues can be increased or expenses reduced 
we also expect that our revenues and earnings will be adversely affected now that generic versions of oxandrin have been introduced 
because of fluctuations in revenues and expenses  it is possible that our operating results for a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and stockholders should not rely on those comparisons to predict our future operating or share price performance 
effecting a change of control of our company could be difficult  which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions include the requirements of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits designated types of business combinations  including mergers  for a period of three years between us and any third party that owns or more of our common stock 
this provision does not apply if our board of directors approves the transaction before the third party acquires of our stock  the third party acquires at least of our stock at the time its ownership goes past the level  or our board of directors and two thirds of the shares of our common stock not held by the third party vote in favor of the transaction 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires more than of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
as a result  the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms fixed by our board of directors 
stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner 
issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to acquire control of us 
no shares of our preferred stock are currently outstanding 
while our board of directors has no current intention or plan to issue any preferred stock  issuance of these shares could also be used as an anti takeover device 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located in east brunswick  new jersey  where we lease approximately  square feet of office space 
the lease expires in march and has two five year renewal options 
effective as of march   we have subleased approximately  square feet of our corporate headquarters office space for an initial term of years  terminable after years at the option of the subtenant 
we also lease an office in san diego  california which is utilized for research and development purposes 
we lease this office space on an annual basis at a base annual rental expense of  the lease expires on may  with an option to extend the term available for an additional one year period 
the extended term would renew at the current base rent plus a seven percent increase 
item legal proceedings patent related litigation we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to us and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by us 
we cannot presently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
the extent to which efforts by other researchers have resulted or will result in patents and the extent to which the issuance of patents to others would have a materially adverse effect on us or would force us to obtain licenses from others is currently unknown

risk factors risks relating to intellectual property for further discussion 
on september   the company filed a lawsuit against barr laboratories  inc barr  a wholly owned subsidiary of barr pharmaceuticals  inc  for infringement of certain of the company s patents related to various methods of using oxandrin 
the action is pending under the caption savient pharmaceuticals  inc v 
barr laboratories  inc in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
the suit was brought under the hatch waxman act in response to barr s filing of an abbreviated new drug application with the fda seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture  use and sale of specified dosages of oxandrolone tablets prior to expiration of the company s patents  all of which are listed in approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations for oxandrin 
subsequent to this  in february barr notified us that they amended their anda to carve out of their proposed labeling uses for the generic oxandrolone tablet intending to avoid the particular uses covered by our method of use 
as a result  we have agreed to dismiss the action without prejudice at this time 
on december   the food and drug administration denied two citizens petitions filed by us  which had been pending since february and september  requesting that the commissioner of food and drugs not approve any abbreviated new drug applications andas for generic oral products containing oxandrolone until i agency adopted bioequivalence standards and a requirement for any generic product to have completed a trial determining whether it may safely be used by patients who take the prescription blood thinner warfarin are satisfied and ii prior to the expiration of our exclusive labeling for geriatric dosing of oxandrin on june  also on december   the fda approved the andas previously filed by sandoz for mg and mg  and upsher smith for mg  dosage forms of generic oral products containing oxandrolone 
following the fda s actions  on december  we filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of new jersey the district court against sandoz pharmaceuticals corp 
sandoz and upsher smith laboratories  inc upsher claiming that their generic oxandrolone products infringe our patents 
table of contents related to various methods of using oxandrin 
we also filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to restrain sandoz and upsher from marketing and selling their generic formulations of oxandrin 
on december  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington  dc the federal circuit issued an order temporarily enjoining all sales of generic oxandrolone tablets by sandoz and upsher smith until the federal circuit had the opportunity to review this matter 
the order was issued by the federal circuit as a result of an appeal filed that same day by us of the order on december of the district court lifting its december restraining order 
on december  the court of appeals denied our motion for a preliminary injunction 
following this  we launched an authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets  usp c iii  an oxandrin brand equivalent product in both the mg and mg dosages in december which is distributed by watson pharmaceuticals 
the launch of oxandrolone is in response to generic competition to oxandrin from sandoz and upsher smith 
in the interim we filed a petition for reconsideration with the fda regarding their rejection of our citizen petitions on the basis that fda failed to adequately consider the significant safety and legal issues raised by permitting approval of generic oxandrolone drug products without the inclusion of labels that contain full geriatric dosing and safety information 
we have not received a decision or other communication regarding this petition for reconsideration to date 
non patent related litigation on december   a purported shareholder class action was filed against the company and three of its former officers 
the action was pending under the caption in re bio technology general corp 
securities litigation  in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
plaintiff alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and sought unspecified compensatory damages 
the plaintiff purported to represent a class of shareholders who purchased shares of the company between april  and august  the complaint asserted that certain of the company s financial statements were materially false and misleading because the company restated its earnings and financial statements for the years ended  and  as described in the company s current report on form k dated  and its press release issued  on august  five nearly identical actions were filed in january and february  in each instance claiming unspecified compensatory damages 
in september  the actions were consolidated and co lead plaintiffs and co lead counsel were appointed in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act 
the parties subsequently entered into a stipulation which provided for the lead plaintiff to file an amended consolidated complaint 
plaintiffs filed such amended complaint and the company filed a motion to dismiss the action 
on august   citing the failure of the amended complaint to set forth particularized facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with the required state of mind  the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the action without prejudice and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint  again seeking unspecified compensatory damages  purporting to set forth particularized facts to support their allegations of violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of by the company and its former officers 
on december   the company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint 
on october   the united states district court for the district of new jersey dismissed  with prejudice  the second amended complaint 
the district court declined to allow plaintiffs to file another amended complaint 
the plaintiffs have filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals for the third circuit  which is currently pending 
we intend to contest the appeal vigorously 
we have referred these claims to our directors and officers insurance carrier  which has reserved its rights as to coverage with respect to this action 
from time to time we become subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products that target unmet medical needs in both niche and broader markets 
we currently sell and distribute branded and distribute a generic version of oxandrolone oxandrolone  which is used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we sell and distribute the branded version of oxandrolone in the united states under the name oxandrin  and we distribute the generic version of oxandrolone through an agreement with watson pharmaceuticals  inc watson 
we launched oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to oxandrin by two generic companies 
we plan to continue to market and distribute the oxandrin brand product directly through wholesalers we are currently developing puricase  a drug targeting the control of elevated levels of uric acid in the blood  or hyperuricemia  in patients with symptomatic gout in whom conventional treatment is contraindicated or has been shown to be ineffective 
puricase is in phase clinical development and has received orphan drug designation by the food and drug administration to puricase fda 
orphan drug designation may prevent competitive products that are not shown to be clinically superior from receiving fda approval for the same indication for a period of seven years from time of pda authorization for marketing 
our strategic plan is to advance the development of puricase and expand our product portfolio by in licensing late stage compounds and exploring co promotion and co development opportunities that fit our expertise in specialty pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals with an initial focus in rheumatology 
prior to august  we also marketed more than pharmaceutical products in oral liquid form in the united kingdom and some eu countries through our former united kingdom subsidiary  rosemont pharmaceuticals  ltd rosemont 
in we commenced a repositioning of our commercial and development operations to focus on the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products  such as puricase 
as a result of this repositioning  we sold rosemont in august  and prior to that  in july we sold our former global biologics manufacturing business  which operated primarily through our former subsidiary  bio technology general israel ltd 
btg israel 
also  in january we completed the sale to indevus pharmaceuticals  inc indevus of delatestryl  our former injectable testosterone product for male hypogonadism 
under the terms of the sale  indevus paid us an initial payment of million and a portion of net sales of the product for the first three years following closing of the transaction based on an escalating scale 
a million gain on the sale of delatestryl was recorded in the first quarter of we have restructured our commercial operations in and early such that we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment which includes sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone  and the research and development activities of puricase 
as part of this restructuring  we discontinued our person oxandrin field sales force in january the results of our former rosemont and btg israel subsidiaries are included as part of discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we were founded in as bio technology general corp 
and changed our name to savient pharmaceuticals  inc in june we conduct our administration  finance  business development  clinical development  sales  marketing  quality assurance and regulatory affairs activities primarily from our headquarters in east brunswick  new jersey 
specialty pharmaceuticals our financial results have been dependent on sales of oxandrin since its product launch in december sales of oxandrin accounted for and of our continuing net product sales for years ended december  and  respectively 
generic competition for oxandrin began in december introduction of these generic products will cause a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which will adversely affect us financially and could require us to scale back some of our business activities 
as a result  
table of contents we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
we do  however  have sufficient cash on hand that will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and puricase clinical trials for at least the next twenty four months 
our generic competitors since december are sandoz pharmaceuticals which received fda approval to market both the mg and mg dosage forms of oxandrolone and upsher smith laboratories which received fda approval to market only the mg dosage form of the drug 
in response to the generic competition that oxandrin experienced in december  we immediately launched  through our distribution partner watson pharmaceuticals  an authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets  usp c iii  an oxandrin brand equivalent product manufactured and supplied by us 
we believe we will capture a significant portion of the generic market through this product launch 
the authorized generic of oxandrolone tablets will meet all quality control standards of the oxandrin brand and will contain the same active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients 
we have a supply and distribution agreement in effect with watson pharmaceuticals which provides for us to receive a significant portion of the gross margin earned by watson on sales of oxandrolone 
in january  as part of a restructuring of our commercial operations in response to generic competition impacting oxandrin  we discontinued the person oxandrin field sales force 
in may  we received written notification of approval from the fda of a special protocol assessment spa for puricase 
we have implemented the protocols in support of a marketing application for the orphan drug indication of the control of hyperuricemia in patients with treatment failure gout in whom conventional therapy is contraindicated or has been ineffective 
in june  we began patient dosing in our phase clinical studies of puricase 
patient recruitment for the clinical trials was completed in march subject to successful completion of our phase clinical trials  we are targeting to file a biologic license application bla for puricase with the fda in early and expect an fda action date by early in january  we completed the sale to indevus pharmaceuticals  inc indevus of delatestryl  our former injectable testosterone product for male hypogonadism 
under the terms of the sale  indevus paid us an initial payment of million and a portion of net sales of the product for the first three years following closing of the transaction based on an escalating scale 
a million gain on the sale of delatestryl was recorded in the first quarter of prior to the sale  product sales of delatestryl had decreased significantly as a result of the fda s allowance of the reintroduction of a generic version of delatestryl into the market in march impact of oxandrin generic competition generic competition for oxandrin began in december introduction of generic products will cause a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which will adversely affect us financially and could require us to scale back some of our business activities 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a less significant product for our future operating results 
in anticipation of this we discontinued our person oxandrin field sales force in january we have evaluated the impact of the generic competition as it relates to current demand for oxandrin 
we have increased valuation reserves related to oxandrin inventory in the amount of million  increased reserves related to product returns in the amount of million and have recorded certain accruals related to purchase commitments in the amount of million for product that we are committed to produce  but may not be able to sell based upon current demand forecasts 
the total adjustment related to the release of oxandrin generics resulted in a charge to income of approximately million in the fourth quarter of this may increase if our demand forecasts are not accurate 
the introduction of oxandrin generics will result in lower demand for oxandrin 
as a result we anticipate that sales will trend downward with a significant reduction in near term shipments in order to ensure that product currently at the wholesalers and retailers will have ample expiration dating 
we expect demand to continue to deteriorate which will result in a long term downward sales trend 

table of contents savient s authorized generic oxandrolone will compete with third party generics 
as a generic product  we anticipate to yield lower selling prices than our oxandrin product and therefore it is not expected to materially offset the anticipated reduction of oxandrin revenues 
discontinued operations during august  we sold our oral liquid pharmaceuticals business in the united kingdom to ingleby limited close brothers private equity close brothers 
under the terms of the sale  close brothers paid to us an aggregate purchase price of million for the issued share capital of rosemont s parent company and certain other related assets 
net proceeds from the transaction after selling costs and taxes were million 
additionally  close brothers purchased certain intellectual property and other assets and rights from us which relate to the business of rosemont  including certain intellectual property related to the soltamox product 
the pre tax gain on disposition of the oral liquid pharmaceuticals business was million 
during july  we sold our former global biologics manufacturing business which primarily operated in israel through btg israel 
financial results related to btg israel are included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and the loss on disposition of the btg israel business was  revenue from discontinued operations  operating income from discontinued operations  and income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december in thousands revenues from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations revenues from discontinued operations decreased by million  or  for the year ended  as compared to the year ended our discontinued operations during included revenues from btg israel and rosemont  whereas our revenues during only included revenues from rosemont up until its sale in august discontinued operations revenues decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to btg israel as included a full year of revenues and included revenues only through july  when we divested this business 
operating income from discontinued operations decreased by million  or for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to a partial period of operations during the year ended december   for rosemont  which was sold in august  as compared to a full year of operations for the same period of operating income from discontinued operations increased by million  or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the increase was attributable to a reduction in research and development and general and administrative expenses in btg israel 
income from discontinued operations increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of this increase was primarily attributable to a million gain on the sale of rosemont  net of income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  related to discontinued operations was million as compared to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million 
the discontinued operations income tax expense primarily related to the gain on sale of rosemont and the discontinued operations income tax expense primarily related to operating profit generated by rosemont and to a lesser extent btg israel 
income from discontinued operations increased by or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of this increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income at btg israel 

table of contents the results of discontinued operations are not included in the discussion entitled results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies include management estimates that are most critical to our reported financial results product revenue recognition 
product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
during  we began shipping oxandrolone to our distributor and have accounted for this on a consignment basis until the product is sold into the retail market 
we have deferred the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria has been met 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
together  sab  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas no 
states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 

table of contents allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to or up to twelve months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg delatestryl in  the company determined  based on its review of stability data  that the oxandrin mg dosage form demonstrated stability over a three year shelf life and thus the company modified the product s label to indicate a year expiration date 
product with three year expiration dating was first sold to our customers in may on january   the company completed its sale of delatestryl to indevus pharmaceuticals  inc we continue to evaluate product returns on sales of delatestryl that occurred prior to the sale date to indevus 
upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
certain specifics regarding these analyses are as follows actual return rates we track actual returns by product and analyze historical return trends 
we use these historical trends as part of our overall process of estimating future returns 
the level of product manufactured the level of product produced has an impact on the valuation of that product 
for productions that exceed anticipated future demand  a valuation adjustment will be required 
generally  this valuation adjustment occurs as an offset to gross inventory 
currently  we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
level of product in the distribution channel we review wholesaler inventory and third party prescription data to ensure that the level of product in the distribution channel is at a reasonable level 
currently  the level of product in the distribution channel appears reasonable for five year and three year expiration product 
the five year expiration product currently has higher levels of inventory in the distribution channel as compared to historical trends 
estimated shelf life product returns generally occur due to product expiration 
therefore  it is important for us to ensure that product sold into the distribution channel has excess dating that will allow the product to be sold through the distribution channel without nearing its expiration date 
currently we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
we have taken the appropriate measures to enforce this policy  including setting up certain controls with our third party distributor 
in addition  we entered into a distributor service agreement with one of our large wholesalers which limits the level of product at the wholesaler 
the terms of this agreement are consistent with the industry s movement toward a fee for service approach which we believe has resulted in better distribution channel inventory management  higher levels of distribution channel transparency  and more consistent buying and selling patterns 
since a majority of our sales flow through three large wholesalers  we expect that these industry changes will have a direct impact on our future sales to wholesalers  inventory management  product returns and estimation capabilities 
current and projected demand we analyze prescription demand data provided by industry standard third party sources 
this data is used to estimate the level of product in the distribution channel and to determine future sales trends 

table of contents product launches and new product introductions for future product launches  we will analyze projected product demand and production levels in order to estimate return and inventory reserve allowances 
new product introductions  including generics  will be monitored for market erosion and adjustments to return estimates will be made accordingly 
we also utilize the guidance provided in sfas no

discusses potential factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including the susceptibility of the product to significant external factors  such as technological obsolescence or changes in demand  relatively long periods in which a particular product may be returned  absence of historical experience with similar types of sales of similar products  or inability to apply such experience because of changing circumstances  for example  changes in the selling enterprise s marketing policies or relationships with its customers  and absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
sab provides additional factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including significant increases in or excess levels of inventory in a distribution channel  lack of visibility into or the inability to determine or observe the levels of inventory in a distribution channel and the current level of sales to end users  expected introductions of new products that may result in the technological obsolescence of and larger than expected returns of current products  the significance of a particular distributor to the registrant s or a reporting segment s business  sales and marketing  the newness of a product  the introduction of competitors products with superior technology or greater expected market acceptance  and other factors that affect market demand and changing trends in that demand for the registrant s products 
as a result of oxandrin generic competition that began in december  we analyzed the impact on product returns considering the product currently at wholesalers and retailers  and the current demand forecasts 
as a result  we recorded an additional product returns reserve of million for the year ended december  the aggregate net return allowance reserves as of december  and was million and million  respectively

our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales 
table of contents through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates

we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
as a result of oxandrin generic competition that began in december  we analyzed the impact on inventory reserves considering the oxandrin inventory currently on hand  inclusive of raw materials and finished goods  and the current demand forecasts 
as a result  we recorded an additional inventory reserve of million for the year ended december  the aggregate net inventory valuation reserves as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have committed to minimum purchase requirements of oxandrin raw material inventory in the future that  based on current demand forecasts  is not expected to be sold 
although we are currently in negotiations with these suppliers there is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce our obligations 
as a result  we accrued for these costs and recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of million for the year ended december  share based compensation

 accounting for stock based compensation 
options are granted to certain employees and directors at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the dates the options are granted 
the options granted have a term of years from the grant date and granted options for employees generally vest ratably over a four year period 
the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date 
we have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation expense  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the cumulative effect on income from continuing operations and net income for year ended december  related to the adoption of sfas no 
r is approximately million which includes both stock option and employee stock purchase plan expenses 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unamortized stock option compensation which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
during  we issued performance share awards to certain employees which could result in the issuance of up to  shares of restricted stock if identified performance objectives are achieved at designated 
table of contents target levels 
compensation cost related to performance shares is based upon the grant date fair value of the shares and management s best estimate as to whether or not the performance criteria will be satisfied 
this amount is recognized ratably over the performance period 
during the year ended december  approximately million of deferred performance share compensation cost has been amortized to expense 
compensation cost adjustments will be made based upon changes in estimates of whether the performance criteria will be satisfied 
during the year ended december  no restricted stock shares have been vested related to the performance shares award program 
results of operations we have historically derived our revenues from product sales as well as from collaborative arrangements with third parties 
the sources of revenue under our historical third party arrangements included up front contract fees  funding for additional research  and reimbursement for producing certain experimental materials  milestone payments and royalties on sales of product 
our funding for additional research conducted by our former btg israel subsidiary includes funding that we historically received from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel 
following the sale of our israeli business operations  the revenue from the historical third party arrangements and future funding from the office of the chief scientist are not available to us 
our revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  including generic products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions

partially offsetting these increases in sales was the impact of lower total prescription volume of for versus this compares with an overall decline in the involuntary weight loss market of
