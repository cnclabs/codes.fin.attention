item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of about us that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document are forward looking statements 
although we believe that in making such statements our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or that include words such as will  would  should  plans  likely  expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  thinks  may  and similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the following important factors  in addition to those discussed under risk factors under part i  item  could affect the future results of the health care industry in general  and us in particular  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
uncertainties in our establishing or maintaining relationships with physicians and hospitals  the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations  uncertainties inherent in third party payors attempts to limit health care coverages and levels of reimbursement  the effects of competition and technological changes  the availability or lack thereof of acquisition or combination opportunities  and general economic  market or business conditions 
general we provide healthcare services and manufacture medical devices  primarily for the urology community 
prior to july   we also designed and manufactured trailers and coaches that transport high technology medical devices and equipment for mobile command and control centers and the media and broadcast industry 
urology services 
our lithotripsy services are provided principally through limited partnerships or other entities that we manage  which use lithotripsy devices 
in  physicians who are affiliated with us used our lithotripters to perform approximately  procedures in the us we do not render any medical services 
rather  the physicians do 
we have two types of contracts  retail and wholesale  that we enter into in providing our lithotripsy services 
retail contracts are contracts where we contract with the hospital and private insurance payors 
wholesale contracts are contracts where we contract only with the hospital 
the two approaches functionally differ in that  under a retail contract  we generally bill for the entire non physician fee for all patients other than governmental pay patients  for which the hospital bills the non physician fee 
under a wholesale contract  the hospital generally bills for the entire non physician fee for all patients 
in both cases  the billing party contractually bears the costs associated with the billing service  including pre certification  as well as non collection 
the non billing party is generally entitled to its fees regardless of whether the billing party actually collects the non physician fee 
accordingly  under the wholesale contracts where we are the non billing party  the hospital generally receives a greater proportion of the total non physician fee to compensate for its billing costs and collection risk 
conversely  under the retail contracts where we generally provide the billing services and bear the collection risk  we receive a greater proportion of the total non physician fee 
although the non physician fee under both retail and wholesale contracts varies widely based on geographical markets and the identity of the third party payor  we estimate that nationally  on average  our share of the non physician fee was roughly  for both and at this time  we do not anticipate a material shift between our retail and wholesale arrangements 
as the general partner of the limited partnerships  we also provide services relating to operating our lithotripters  including scheduling  staffing  training  quality assurance  regulatory compliance  and contracting with payors  hospitals and surgery centers 
also in the urology segment  we provide treatments for benign and cancerous conditions of the prostate 
in treating benign prostate disease  we deploy three technologies trans urethral microwave therapy tumt  photo selective vaporization of the prostate pvp  and trans urethral needle ablation tuna 
all three technologies apply an energy source which reduces the size of the prostate gland 
for treating prostate and other cancers  prior to november   we used a procedure called cryosurgery  a process which uses a double freeze thaw cycle to destroy cancer cells 
we recognize urology revenue primarily from the following sources fees for urology services 
a substantial majority of our urology revenue is derived from fees related to lithotripsy treatments performed using our lithotripters 
we  through our partnerships or other entities  facilitate the use of our equipment and provide other support services in connection with these treatments at hospitals and other health care facilities 
for a further discussion on our partnerships  see urology and government regulation and supervision in part i 
the professional fee payable to the physician performing the procedure is generally billed and collected by the physician 
benign prostate disease and prostate cancer treatment services are billed in the same manner as our lithotripsy services under either retail or wholesale contracts 
these services are also primarily performed through limited partnerships  which we manage 
fees for operating our lithotripters 
through our partnerships and otherwise directly by us  we provide services related to operating our lithotripters and receive a management fee for performing these services 
medical products 
we manufacture  sell and maintain lithotripters and their related consumables 
we also manufacture  sell and maintain intra operative x ray imaging systems and other mobile patient management tables 
we recognize medical device sales and service revenue from the following sources fees for maintenance services 
we provide equipment maintenance services to our partnerships as well as outside parties 
these services are billed either on a time and material basis or at a fixed monthly contractual rate 
fees for equipment sales  consumable sales and licensing applications 
we manufacture  sell and maintain lithotripters and certain medical tables 
we also manufacture and sell consumables related to the lithotripters 
with respect to some lithotripter sales  in addition to the original sales price  we receive a licensing fee from the buyer of the lithotripter for each patient treated with such lithotripter 
in exchange for this licensing fee  we provide the buyer of the lithotripter with certain consumables 
all the sales for devices and consumables are recognized when the related items are delivered 
revenues from licensing fees are recorded when the patient is treated 
recent developments on june   we entered into an interest and stock purchase agreement pursuant to which oshkosh agreed to acquire our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment for million in cash 
we completed this sale on july  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment to repay our term loan b in full and our mortgage debt related to our building in austin  texas 
on november   we sold our cryosurgery operations to advanced medical partners  inc  a closely held private company ampi 
we used the proceeds from the sale to acquire approximately of the outstanding shares of ampi 
due to the uncertainty of any future distributions related to our ampi shares  we have assigned no value to this investment 
on february   we entered into a stock purchase agreement and an interest purchase agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of keystone abg  inc  which owns a general partner interest in keystone mobile partners  lp the partnership  all of the outstanding capital stock of keystone kidney associates  pc  and an approximate limited partner interest in the partnership from the owners thereof  for an aggregate purchase price of  plus an earnout 
the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and the company can give no assurances that it will close 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets are both a critical accounting policy and estimate that requires judgment and is based on assumptions of future operations 
we are required to test for impairments at least annually or if circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we test for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter 
we now have two reporting units  urology services and medical products 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using estimated discounted future cash flow projections 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment to our goodwill totaling million related to our urology services segment and million related to our medical products segment 
the impairment to our urology services segment is due primarily to a decrease in the number of overall procedures during  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with the loss of certain partnerships and contracts late in the impairment in our medical products segment relates primarily to our decision to reduce or exit certain product lines during the fourth quarter of as of december   we had goodwill of million 
a second critical accounting policy and estimate which requires judgment of management is the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
we have based our estimates on historical collection amounts  current contracts with payors  current changes of the facts and circumstances relating to these matters and certain negotiations with related payors 
a third critical accounting policy is consolidation of our investment in partnerships or limited liability companies llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  and entities more than owned and limited partnerships or llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the related agreements provide us with broad powers 
the other parties do not participate in the management of the entity and do not have the substantial ability to remove us 
investment in entities in which our investment is less than ownership and we do not have significant control are accounted for by the equity method if ownership is between  or by the cost method if ownership is less than 
we have reviewed each of the underlying agreements and determined we have effective control  however  if it was determined this control did not exist  these investments would be reflected on the equity method of accounting 
although this would change individual line items within our consolidated financial statements  it would have no effect on our net income and or total stockholders equity 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues decreased  as compared to revenues from our urology services segment decreased  as compared to revenues from our lithotripsy business decreased  in as compared to  while revenues from our prostate business decreased  in as compared to the actual number of lithotripsy procedures performed in decreased by compared to  primarily due to weak performance across our western region partnerships and the loss of certain partnerships and contracts in late the average rate per procedure increased by in as compared to revenues for our medical products segment increased by  compared to primarily due to a mix of sales between external customers and sales to our urology services segment 
medical products revenues before intersegment eliminations totaled million for and million for we sold lithotripters and tables in compared to lithotripters and tables in revenues from our service operations and consumable sales decreased  in as compared to revenues from our new lab which started operations in january  totaled  for the year ended december  our costs of services and general and administrative expenses for increased  compared to our costs associated with salaries  wages and benefits in increased  compared to the primary cause of this increase relates to million in severance costs paid to two executives in  million of share based compensation cost recorded in and an increase in our medical products segment salaries of approximately million  primarily related to increased head count in our sales force and our new lab 
our costs associated with other costs of services for the year ended december  increased  compared to this increase relates primarily to increased medical supplies costs in our prostate operations as well as increased costs of travel primarily in our medical products segment 
our bad debt expense also increased approximately  in as compared to our general and administrative costs increased  over this increase relates primarily to additional recruiting costs related to the searches for our new ceo and cfo  totaling approximately  and additional board of director fees totaling approximately  related to a change in board compensation in late costs associated with legal and professional fees increased  in this increase is primarily due to million in fees from our strategic consultants 
manufacturing costs increased  in this increase is due primarily to the increase in sales to external customers  noted above 
in the future  we expect margins in medical products to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment to our goodwill totaling million related to our urology services segment and million related to our medical products segment 
the impairment to our urology services segment is due primarily to a decrease in the number of overall procedures during  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with the loss of certain partnerships and contracts late in the impairment in our medical products segment relates primarily to our decision to reduce or exit certain product lines during the fourth quarter of on june   we entered into an agreement to sell our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment 
accordingly  in we have classified this segment as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the sale was completed on july  as a result of the sale we realized a gain of million  which is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
this gain utilized approximately million of our deferred tax assets 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  in compared to minority interest in consolidated income for decreased  compared to  as a result of a decrease in income from our urology services segment due primarily to lower revenues noted above 
provision for income taxes in decreased  compared to due to a decrease in taxable income  primarily related to our goodwill impairment recorded in our effective tax rate significantly increased in as compared to  since approximately half of our goodwill impairment was not deductible for tax purposes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues increased  as compared to revenues from our urology services operations increased by  primarily related to the merger between prime and hss in november and significant growth in our greenlight laser operations 
urology services revenues associated with legacy hss entities increased million in from  primarily due to reflecting a full twelve months of operations of legacy hss entities  while greenlight laser revenues from our organic operations increased from  in to  in the actual number of procedures performed in increased by compared to  primarily due to reflecting a full twelve months of operations of legacy hss entities

the merger with hss in november  is the primary reason for the large increases in all expense categories  as reflects a full twelve months of operations as opposed to the two months of operations post merger in our costs associated with salaries  wages and benefits in increased  compared to our costs associated with other costs of services for the year ended december  increased  compared to  primarily due to reflecting the full year of legacy hss operations as well as million in additional supply costs related to green light lasers 
our general and administrative costs increased  over costs associated with legal and professional fees increased  in manufacturing costs increased  in this increase is due primarily to the increase in sales to external customers 
in the future  we expect margins in medical products to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales

provision for income taxes in increased  compared to due to an increase in taxable income 
the effective tax rate increased in as compared to due to contingencies being reversed in  as the statute of limitations expired 
outlook as discussed above under recent developments  the urology services segment experienced a decrease in overall lithotripsy procedures during as compared to  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with loss of certain partnerships and contracts in the fourth quarter of in addition  we exited or reduced sales efforts in certain product lines in the medical products segment in the fourth quarter of the numbers of procedures performed have remained relatively stable over the third and fourth quarters of we intend to increase our urology services operations primarily through forming new operating partnerships in new markets as well as by acquisitions 
we intend to grow our medical products operations by offering new equipment and expanding our customer base 
as of the date of filing this annual report on form k  we anticipate that the levels of revenues and income from continuing operations exclusive of goodwill impairments for will be materially consistent with or lower than the reported financial results for we cannot provide assurances that the results will be materially consistent with our results 
see forward looking statements under this item and risk factors under part i  item liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were  and  at december  and  respectively 
our subsidiaries generally distribute all of their available cash quarterly  after establishing reserves for estimated capital expenditures and working capital 
for the years ended december  and  our subsidiaries distributed cash of approximately  and  respectively  to minority interest holders 
cash provided by our operations was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  from to  fee and other revenue collected decreased by  due primarily to decreased revenues 
cash paid to employees  suppliers of goods and others decreased by  in these fluctuations are attributable to the significant payoff of accrued expenses in as well as a decrease in inventory purchases in cash provided by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  we purchased equipment and leasehold improvements totaling  in cash from discontinued operations was  and consisted primarily of the sales proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment 
cash used by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  primarily due to  in equipment and leasehold improvements purchases

bad debt expense was approximately  for senior credit facility our senior credit facility is comprised of a five year million revolver and a million senior secured term loan b due we entered into this senior credit facility in march the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor to or prime 
to 
on july   we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment to repay the term loan b in full 
as of december   there were no amounts drawn on the revolver 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  create liens  make investments  sell assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and make acquisitions 
in addition  our facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility as of december  notes in april  our million term loan b referred to above was funded and we used the proceeds to redeem the million of unsecured senior subordinated notes 
the notes were subject to an rate of interest and interest was payable semi annually on april st and october st 
principal was due april other interest rate swap 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap which was designated as a fair value hedge pursuant to the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this swap was executed to convert million of the notes from a fixed to floating rate instrument 
the floating rate was based on libor plus 
in march  we amended our interest rate swap agreement to add an additional million with a floating rate based on libor plus 
we terminated the swaps in may in august  we entered into two new interest rate swaps for million each which were also designated as fair value hedges 
the floating rates of these two interest rate swap agreements were based on libor plus and  respectively 
in january  we terminated these swaps for approximately  in the second quarter of  approximately  in proceeds from these swaps were recognized when the notes were redeemed as described above 
other long term debt 
on july   we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment to repay approximately million of mortgage debt related to our building in austin  texas 
as of december   we had notes totaling million related to equipment purchased by our limited partnerships 
these notes are paid from the cash flows of the related partnerships 
they bear interest at libor or prime plus a certain premium and are due over the next three years 
other long term obligations 
at december   we had an obligation totaling  related to payments to the previous owner of one of our subsidiaries for  per quarter until march  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement 
also at december   as part of our medstone acquisition  we had an obligation totaling  related to payments to an employee for  a month until february  and  a month beginning march  and continuing until february  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement 
we also had as part of the prime hss merger  two obligations totaling  related to payments to two previous employees of hss

 of the put rights discussed in recent developments under this item in addition  the scheduled principal repayments for all long term debt as of december  are payable as follows in thousands thereafter total  our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our cash flows from operations and therefore our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors discussed under risk factors under part i 
likewise  our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility will depend on these factors  which will affect our ability to comply with the covenants in our facility and our ability to obtain waivers for  or otherwise address  any noncompliance with the terms of our facility with our lenders 
we intend to increase our urology services operations primarily through forming new operating subsidiaries in new markets as well as by acquisitions 
we seek opportunities to grow our medical products operations by offering new equipment and expanding our customer base 
we intend to fund the purchase price for future acquisitions and developments using borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash flows from our operations 
in addition  we may use shares of our common stock in such acquisitions where we deem appropriate 
based upon the current level of our operations and anticipated cost savings and revenue growth  we believe that cash flows from our operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our senior credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs both for the short term and for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that we will realize our anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
inflation our operations are not significantly affected by inflation because we are not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of our expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement 
the interpretations in sab contain guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach as well as provide transition guidance for correcting errors 
this interpretation does not change the requirements within sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb and fasb statement  for the correction of an error on financial statements 
sab is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  we adopted this interpretation on december  the adoption of sab did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin clearly scopes out income taxes from fasb no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect fin will have on our consolidated financial position  cash flows  or results from operations 
at its june meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus which was ratified by the fasb on eitf with regards to consolidation of limited partnership interests by the general partner 
the requirements replace counterpart requirements in statement of position sop  which provides guidance on accounting for investments in real estate ventures  but has come to be used for all types of limited partnerships 
eitf is based on the same presumption in sop that the general partner controls the limited partnership and should consolidate it  regardless of the level of its ownership interest 
however  eitf establishes a new framework for evaluating whether the presumption that the general partner controls the limited partnership is overcome 
the presumption of general partner control would be overcome only if the limited partners have either kick out rights the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or participating rights the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the partnership s business 
the kick out rights and the participating rights must be substantive in order to overcome the presumption of general partner control 
we adopted eitf effective january  and this adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in an accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas effective january   and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  amendment to arb no 
chapter sfas no 
 which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and the impact was not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we had long term debt including current portion totaling  of which  had fixed rates of to  and  incurred interest at a variable rate equal to a specified prime rate 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the remaining floating interest rate debt totaling  we make monthly or quarterly payments of principal and interest on  of the floating rate debt 
an increase in interest rates of would result in a  annual increase in interest expense on this existing principal balance
