item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k 
business overview rogers corporation is a global enterprise that provides its customers with innovative solutions with industry leading materials based specialty products for a variety of markets that include portable communications devices  communications infrastructure  computer and office equipment  aerospace and defense  ground transportation  and consumer markets 
the company generates revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacturing  and distribution of specialty material based products and components that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oem s and contract manufacturers  that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  rogers business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
the company s ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how the company s customers will react to these changing conditions  it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by the company s customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  the company s sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on net sales 
the company s current focus is on worldwide markets that have an increasing percentage of materials being used to support growing high technology applications  such as cellular base stations and antennas  handheld wireless devices  satellite television receivers  hard disk drives and automotive electronics 
the company continues to focus on business opportunities around the globe and particularly in the asian marketplace  as evidenced by the continued investment in and expansion of its manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china  which function as the company s manufacturing base to serve its customers in asia 
rogers goal is to become the supplier of choice for its customers in all of the various markets in which the company participates 
to achieve this goal  the company strives to make the best products in these respective markets and to deliver the highest level of service to its customers 
in the past few years the company has worked to better align its business with its customers  which includes having manufacturing capacity close to its customers in order to be responsive to their needs and to manufacture the highest quality products 
to reach these goals  the company has invested significantly in its operations in china  as many of its products  including electroluminescent el lamps  busbars  elastomer components and floats are now being manufactured at its campus in suzhou  china 
the company continues to focus on the expansion of this facility  particularly as the demand for certain key products  such as el lamps  continues to grow from its asian customers 
the company has future plans to expand this facility s manufacturing capacity to include printed circuit materials  as well as new polyurethane foam capacity at its rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris joint venture 
most of the manufacturing capacity that has been placed in china is now operating at yield and efficiency levels comparable to its us and belgian operations  allowing the company to further leverage the favorable cost and tax structures available in china 
much of the company s recently experienced record operating results are directly attributable to the china operations and the increasing demand for the company s industry leading products 
the company continues to focus on growing its key strategic businesses  particularly those that serve the portable communications devices markets 
as a result of the substantial efforts made in the last few years to reshape and grow the business  the company experienced record sales and profit levels in management believes that the company is taking the steps to ensure that it has sufficient resources to focus on new business development and the necessary production capacity in place in its key markets to further grow its strategic businesses and believes that the strong performance experienced in will continue in going forward  the company is also focused on developing new markets  such as semiconductor thermal management  that it believes will provide growth opportunities for its specialty materials products 
as such  the company entered into a strategic partnership with thermal transfer composites corporation ttc  a company that has significant intellectual property associated with certain products in the semiconductor thermal management market  in the third quarter 
under this agreement  the company will support ttc s research and development efforts that will enable the further development of ttc s proprietary technology and also provide ttc with additional distribution channels to broaden its range of potential customers 
the agreement also includes an option to buy the business after a set period of time if certain milestones are achieved 
the company believes that pursuing these types of arrangements with companies that have emerging technologies and products will help foster and drive its future growth and allow the company to diversify its product and market base  while minimizing the risk to the company 
in addition  in november  the company purchased the composite business of precision castparts corp 
pcc  which is a worldwide manufacturer of complex metal components and products 
in conjunction with the partnership with ttc  the company now believes that it has the ability to deliver the largest range of metal matrix composite solutions in the world 
realigning certain businesses  particularly in its other polymer products reportable segment  to fit the long term strategic goals of the company and to bring that segment to acceptable profitability levels is another focus of the company 
as evidenced by the impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of on both its polyolefin foam and polyester based industrial laminates businesses  the company is aggressively evaluating the long term prospects of each of its businesses in an effort to further strengthen its core product base and to focus on the key businesses that management believes will allow the company to continue to grow in the future 
rogers continues to work diligently to constantly improve its processes and to expand its presence in the markets in which it participates 
to help drive these improvements  the company continues to invest in its six sigma initiatives to help streamline and improve its processes from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service 
the company continuously has projects in progress as it is focused on gaining both operational and transactional efficiencies as a result of its six sigma efforts 
also  as part of the efforts to standardize the operational and financial processes and procedures it relies upon around the world  the company is focusing significant effort and making strong progress in the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will bring its worldwide locations under a common system and allow for timely sharing of information around the globe 
as with its past initiatives  the company expects that these future undertakings will better position the company for the long term  but that it will take some time before the company is able to achieve the desired benefits 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales manufacturing margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating profit equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income income before income taxes income taxes net income vs 
net sales the company experienced record sales in of million  an increase of from million of sales in the increase in sales is primarily due to an increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in  as well as slight increases in sales in each of the company s three other reportable segments 
the factors resulting in these sales increases are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased approximately basis points to in from in the increase in margins is primarily attributable to an increase of percentage points in margins in the custom electrical components reportable segment to in from in this increase is primarily driven from the increase in operating leverages due to the sales growth mentioned above  as well as improved production efficiencies  particularly in the new manufacturing operations in china 
in addition  margins in the other polymer products reportable segment increased to in from in primarily due to the improved operating results in polyolefin foams in as compared to  as a result of the restructuring activities that occurred in manufacturing margins in the high performance foams and printed circuit materials reportable segments were relatively flat year over year 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was driven by additional incentive compensation expense in  primarily related to the increase in sales volume and operating results in  as well as the expensing of stock options and other equity awards as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in the first quarter of overall selling and administrative expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses decreased slightly in to as compared to in the company s strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
the company continues to invest in research and development to improve its existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that the company believes will complement its existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in charges were comprised of million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the polyolefin foam business and million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the polyester based industrial laminates business 
charges included million related to the impairment of certain assets of the polyolefin foam business and million in charges related to the impairment of certain machinery and equipment associated with the company s high frequency materials business 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows polyolefin foams the company acquired certain assets of the polyolefin foam business  including intellectual property rights  inventory  machinery and equipment  and customer lists from cellect llc  in the beginning of fiscal year the company migrated the manufacturing process to its carol stream  illinois facility  which was completed at the end of the third quarter of this migration included the development of new process technology and the purchase of custom machinery  which the company believed at the time would allow it to gain efficiencies in the manufacturing process and improvements in product quality 
after completing this transition  the company focused on realizing these previously anticipated efficiencies and improvements  but encountered a variety of business issues  including changing customer requirements in the polyolefin marketplace  a significant increase in raw material costs  and other quality and delivery issues 
in light of these circumstances  the company commenced a study in the first quarter of to update its market understanding and assess the long term viability of the polyolefin business 
this study was completed in the second quarter of and confirmed that the business environment surrounding the polyolefin foam business had changed from the time of the company s initial purchase in  which caused the company to revisit its business plan for the polyolefin foam business 
at that time  the polyolefin business was experiencing significant operating losses and  during the second quarter of  the company concluded that under the existing circumstances it would be very difficult and cost prohibitive to produce the current polyolefin products on a profitable basis and decided to scale back on the business by shedding unprofitable customers and concentrating on developing new  more profitable polyolefin products 
this conclusion led to the performance of an impairment analysis that was conducted in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and resulted in the million charge recorded in subsequent to the second quarter of  the company worked to improve the operating performance and cash flows of the newly restructured business 
the company shed its most unprofitable product lines  which resulted in the retention of only one significant customer 
in order to achieve acceptable profitability levels  the company negotiated a prospective arrangement with this customer  which included a significant pricing increase and preferred supplier status for this particular product 
this agreement would be effective for a one year period beginning in january however  given the apparent mutually beneficial relationship with this customer at that time  the company believed that this arrangement would be sustained for a longer period of time  which would generate sufficient cash flows to allow further growth in this business 
in particular  the company believed that the related polyolefin products being purchased by this customer had a distinct technological advantage in the marketplace 
at the end of  the long term projections associated with this business were based on the newly negotiated contract  the assumption that this contract would be renewed at the end of  and the organic growth the company had experienced with this customer since the acquisition of the business  which the company believed would continue in the future 
the anticipated improvements in the business were further validated by the significant improvements in operating results and cash flows in the second half of as compared to the first half of the year and the further improvement achieved in the first half of overall  these projections supported the recoverability of the residual asset base of the polyolefin business and the company determined that no additional impairment charges were necessary at the end of in the second quarter of  however  this customer approached the company with a demand to significantly reduce the pricing of its products  as well as to reduce volume levels of purchases from the company 
although this demand was not prohibited under the terms of the existing supply agreement  compliance would result in immediate and significant reductions in profitability levels that were inconsistent with previous projections 
this led the company to begin negotiations on a new contract that would be effective after the existing contract expired at the end of the company believed that  even under the most favorable outcome  the results of this negotiation would have a significant negative impact on the long term outlook of its polyolefin foam business as the business would be impacted by both lower product pricing and lower volume levels  resulting in lower long term revenues and operating margins 
the company concluded that this pending contract and change in the business relationship with this customer was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the remaining assets of the polyolefin foam business under sfas and sfas the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process  resulted in the company recording an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of related to the goodwill associated with this business  which is aggregated into the company s other polymer products reportable segment 
polyester based industrial laminates in the second quarter of  the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the polyester based industrial laminates pbil business  which is aggregated into the company s other polymer products reportable segment 
this business has historically focused its product offerings in the cable market  which is a market that has become more commodity based with increased competition  and has experienced significant raw material price increases  particularly in copper and aluminum 
over the past few years  the company chose to change its strategic focus and long term operational plans to the non cable industry  which it believed would yield higher margins and less competition 
in the second quarter of  a customer notified the company that a key program related to a new  emerging technology had been cancelled 
this customer  a major automotive manufacturer  had initially designed the company s new product into one of its programs  but decided to incorporate a different  less expensive technology into the program instead 
this program was a key strategic initiative related to the long term growth of this business in the non cable industry 
the company is currently evaluating other potential customers for this technology  but is currently not designed into any specific programs 
the nature of this product requires a design in period of at least a few years in advance of the end product becoming available to consumers  therefore  the cancellation of this program significantly impacted the long term forecasts and projections of the business and consequently  the fair value of the business 
the company determined that the cancellation of this program was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenue and margin growth of this business 
consequently  the company performed an impairment analysis on the pbil business under sfas in the previous impairment analysis prepared by the company in the fourth quarter of as part of its annual valuation performed in accordance with sfas  the company utilized annual revenue growth rates of approximately  which considered the future sales of this new technology in the program it was designed into at that time 
as a result of the cancellation of the program  the company revised its growth projections to approximately annually and also revised its projected margin levels for the revised product mix projections and higher than expected raw material prices 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process  resulted in the company recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the entity s other long lived assets 
at december   the pbil business has a remaining book value of approximately million  comprised primarily of accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets and residual goodwill of approximately million 
high frequency materials also in  an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter on certain manufacturing equipment related to the high frequency materials operating segment 
specifically  the charge related to certain idle presses used in the high frequency manufacturing processes 
at the end of  the company had no current plan to use the equipment in the near future  therefore  it determined that recording the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was appropriate 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the success of rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris  the company s high performance foams joint venture in suzhou  china 
ris started operations in china in early and experienced operating losses in the first half of that year 
ris began to contribute positively to the company s results in the fourth quarter of and has continued this positive trend throughout results at the company s other joint ventures were relatively flat year over year 
other income expense other income increased from million in to million in this increase is attributable primarily to certain charges in which did not recur in  including a million charge for certain environmental remediation matters at the company s facility in south windham  connecticut and a million charge related to the buy out of certain tenant lease arrangements in the company s suzhou  china facilities 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in and in in  the effective tax rate benefited from profits generated in jurisdictions with low tax rates percentage point reduction and non taxable foreign sales income two percentage point reduction 
also in  the effective tax rate continued to benefit from general business credits one percentage point reduction  partially offset by expense related to repatriation of foreign profits three percentage point increase 
in  the effective tax rate benefited from non taxable foreign sales income percentage point reduction  profits generated in jurisdictions with low tax rates percentage point reduction as well as an adjustment to reconcile the tax return as filed in the third quarter of to the year end projections percentage point reduction 
it is the company s policy  in accordance with apb  that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
the company provides deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of its japanese high performance foams joint venture 
the net deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits available in excess of the expected tax on the undistributed income is entirely offset by a corresponding valuation allowance due to the future uncertainty of the recognition of such credits as they may be limited under the us tax code 
the company also claims a us benefit for nontaxable foreign sales income as allowed under the current extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
the world trade organization has upheld a challenge of this regime by the european union and  in response  the us has enacted the american jobs creation act of that repealed eti and created a manufacturers activity deduction 
eti will be phased out by limiting the calculated deduction to in  in and thereafter 
the manufacturing deduction is in the process of being phased in as a deduction on the income from certain qualifying activities in and increasing to a deduction in the company has determined that the net effect of these items will not materially affect its tax rate in the short term  but may have an impact  given the nature of the company s international business  once these changes are fully phased in 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to eti is two percentage points and percentage points for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to the manufacturers activity deduction is less than one percentage point and two percentage points for and  respectively 
the company is eligible for a tax holiday on its earnings in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations are taxed at a zero percent tax rate 
in  the second year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to the zero percent tax rate  resulting in a decrease in the company s effective tax rate of percentage points  or in diluted earnings per share 
in years three through five of the tax holiday the tax rate in effect is and in year six and beyond  the tax rate is  subject to local government approval 
backlog the company s backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at january  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for electroluminescent lamps  primarily into the portable handheld communication device market  increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end  in addition to increases in the backlog for other products sold in that segment 
vs 
net sales net sales decreased by in to million from sales of million in the decline in sales is primarily due to a decline in sales in the printed circuit materials reportable segment from million in to million in  as well as a decline in sales of the company s other polymer products reportable segment from million in to million in these sales declines were partially mitigated by a increase in sales of the high performance foams reportable segment from million to million and an increase in the custom electrical components reportable segment of from million in to million in these sales fluctuations are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased approximately basis points to in from in the decline in margins is primarily attributable to a decline of percentage points in margins in the custom electrical components reportable segment due primarily to the start up of operations in asia in both the electroluminescent lamp and busbar operations 
margins related to electroluminescent lamps were below expected levels  particularly in the beginning of  as this was the first time the company had manufactured this type of lamp using its new technology 
as a result  yields were low as the company worked to improve production results as a result of the learning curve typically associated with the introduction of a new product 
at the end of  margins had improved substantially on these lamps  both in the us and in asia  although not enough to compensate for the unfavorable results experienced in the beginning of the year 
partially mitigating this negative impact was a basis point increase in margins in the high performance foams reportable segment  driven primarily by operating efficiencies gained in the silicone foams product line as margins of polyurethane foams remained consistent with results 
margins in the printed circuit materials reportable segment were relatively flat year over year and margins in the other polymer products reportable segment were also materially consistent in as compared to selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses of million in were consistent with expenditures in and increased slightly as a percentage of sales from in to in the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is due primarily to the sales decline in as compared to as expenses remained consistent with spending levels 
research and development expenses research and development expenses remained relatively consistent in as compared to  decreasing slightly from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses increased slightly in to as compared to in the company s strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
the company continues to invest in research and development to improve its existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that the company believes will complement its existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in charges included million related to the impairment of certain assets of the polyolefin foam business and million in charges related to the impairment of certain machinery and equipment associated with the company s high frequency materials business 
charges were comprised of approximately million due to the relocation of the company s elastomer component business from connecticut to china and million related to severance charges for certain employees of the company s durel division 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows polyolefin foams the company acquired certain assets of the polyolefin foam business  including intellectual property rights  inventory  machinery and equipment  and customer lists from cellect llc  in the beginning of fiscal year the company migrated the manufacturing process to its carol stream  illinois facility  which was completed at the end of the third quarter of this migration included the development of new process technology and the purchase of custom machinery  which the company believed at the time would allow it to gain efficiencies in the manufacturing process and improvements in product quality

this charge includes a million impairment charge on certain long lived assets and million in charges related to the write down of inventory and receivables related to the polyolefin foam business 
high frequency materials also in  an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter on certain manufacturing equipment related to the high frequency materials operating segment 
specifically  the charge relates to certain idle presses used in the high frequency manufacturing processes 
at the end of  the company had no current plan to use the equipment in the near future  therefore  it determined that recording the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was appropriate 
south windham facility on january   the company announced that it would cease operations at its south windham  connecticut facility by the end of the relocation of manufacturing operations of the company s molded polyurethane materials and nitrile rubber floats to the company s facility in suzhou  china was completed in the third quarter of total charges associated with this transaction amounted to approximately million related primarily to severance that was paid to employees upon termination and completion of service requirements 
in addition  the company recognized a million curtailment charge on its defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of as a result of the termination of employees as the amortizable prior service cost related to terminated employees was accelerated into as a result of the shutdown 
durel on october   the company announced a restructuring plan that resulted in a headcount reduction at durel 
the terminations occurred early in the fourth quarter of and  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the company recognized approximately  in charges associated with related severance amounts due to eligible employees 
all amounts were paid as of year end equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the start up of operations at the company s new foam joint venture in china  ris 
operations for ris began in late and did not become profitable until late  thus mitigating the positive operating results experienced at the company s other joint ventures  rcct and ric 
other income expense other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease was attributable primarily to the following factors i a decrease of approximately million in royalty income as a royalty agreement that was entered into when the company divested its moldable composites division in comes to an end as payments associated with this agreement decline over the life of the agreement  ii million gain on the sale of a building in arizona in  iii million charge in to accrue for certain environmental remediation matters at the company s facility in south windham  connecticut  and iv million charge in related to the buy out of certain tenant lease arrangements in the company s suzhou  china facilities

backlog the company s backlog of firm orders was million at fiscal year end  as compared to million at fiscal year end the increase in is due primarily to orders related to the printed circuit materials reportable segment  as backlog increased by almost million at year end as compared to year end due to the increase in orders in certain markets  particularly satellite television and communications 
segment sales and operations printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income sales in the printed circuit materials reportable segment increased by in as compared to  in which it declined by from this increase was driven by an increase in sales of high frequency material products of in  partially offset by a decline in sales in the flexible circuit materials business of in the overall increase in sales in this segment was driven by sales into the segment s key strategic end markets cellular communications infrastructure and satellite dishes for television reception 
this segment is also experiencing improved traction with its advanced circuit materials in smaller emerging markets  such as local area networks  semiconductor chip packaging  and wifi and wimax as its high performance materials are uniquely suited for the increasingly higher data transmission rates required for newer small and large scale wireless applications 
operating income includes stock compensation and other incentive compensation expense in of million  which was not incurred in excluding the additional compensation expense  operating income  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in as compared to in and in the primary driver of this decline was sales volume in the flex circuit materials business as the company was able to leverage its existing overhead structure to drive profit performance in  while having to absorb these costs at lower volume levels in and custom electrical components dollars in millions net sales operating income loss net sales of the custom electrical components reportable segment increased in as compared to and in as compared to the increase in sales in and to record levels was driven primarily by sales of electroluminescent el lamps into the portable handheld communication device market  particularly in cell phone applications 
much of the sales growth is attributable to expansion in china that enabled the company to increase its el lamp manufacturing capacity to meet current market demand and drove sales growth 
consumer trends toward thin profile phones  with superior backlit keypads utilizing el lamps  are expected to continue to drive sales in this segment through sales of the company s power distribution component products were also strong  up in as compared to  as the company began to utilize the capacity added in china late in and as it further penetrates the asian marketplace 
operating income loss includes stock compensation and other incentive compensation expense in of million  which was not incurred in excluding the additional compensation expense  operating income loss  as a percentage of sales  increased to in as compared to in and in the increase in is due primarily to the increase in sales discussed above  as the company was better able to leverage its overhead base at these higher volumes to maximize returns on its sales volumes and due to significant improvement in manufacturing efficiencies in suzhou  china 
high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income high performance foams reportable segment net sales increased in as compared to and in as compared to the sales increase is attributable to the continued growth in poron urethane foam product sales  which increased in as compared to and in as compared to sales of silicone foams also increased in by as compared to  as opposed to a decrease in of as compared to high performance foam materials are sold into every market segment the company addresses  and most showed strength in thinner  low density foam products introduced earlier in sold well into a variety of handheld electronics products for cushioning and dust sealing applications 
operating income includes stock compensation and other incentive compensation expense in of million  which was not incurred in excluding the additional compensation expense  operating income  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively consistent at in as compared to in and in the increase from to was primarily attributable to the company being able to better leverage the increase in sales against its overhead base to maximize returns on its sales volumes 
other polymer products dollars in millions net sales operating loss the company s other polymer products reportable segment includes elastomer components and floats  composite materials  industrial laminates  and polyolefin foams 
net sales of the other polymer products reportable segment increased in as compared to and decreased in as compared to the sales increase in is primarily attributable to increases in the elastomer components and floats  industrial laminates and polyolefin foams businesses 
the sales decline in as compared to was attributable primarily to the restructuring of the polyolefin foam business  where the company eliminated several unprofitable customers  and to the decline in sales of elastomer components of in as compared to  which stemmed from volatility in the automotive market 
operating loss includes stock compensation and other incentive compensation expense in of million  which was not incurred in in addition  the company recorded restructuring charges of million in and million in see restructuring and impairment charges above for further discussion 
excluding these charges  the other polymer products reportable segment operating income  as a percentage of sales  was in as compared to an operating loss  as a percentage of sales  of in and in the improvement in operating results in is primarily attributable the increase in sales across the various businesses in the other polymer products reportable segment and the benefits from the restructuring activities 
the company continues to evaluate the viability of its current product portfolio in this segment and constantly pursues other opportunities to further improve the results of this segment

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin 
fin is effective for accounting periods commencing after december  and the company intends to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the company is currently assessing the impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believes that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances known to the company  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used  or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows environmental and product liabilities the company accrues for its environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prp s  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
the company is exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
in late  the company determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to it at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine its potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  the company s limited claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  the company believes that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  the company also believes that its ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required the company to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
the company believes the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of its asbestos litigation 
the original liability model determined the company s future liability annually for a year period and was updated at the end of the company believes  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to it  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify its liability is five years  resulting in a liability at december  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if the company were to adjust its assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from five years to seven years would be an increase to the liability of million  which the company believes would be substantially covered by insurance  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from five years to three years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  the company plans to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and the company will update them if needed based on the company s experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that the company s accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate its actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that its accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that it will incur additional charges for its asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot estimate such excess amounts at this time 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards to be used in determining the effect of income taxes 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the company establishes a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under sfas and in evaluating tax positions 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
the company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
inventory allowances the company maintains a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
the company s obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a basis point adjustment to the december  obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
determining the fair value of an operating segment is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
the company believes that the assumptions and rates used in its annual impairment test under sfas are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of on the four operating segments for which the company had goodwill recorded as of the fourth quarter of  the annual testing date  and did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for two of the operating segments  which carry million of the total million goodwill  as of the fourth quarter of ranged from approximately million to million 
for the other two operating segments  which carry million of the million goodwill  the excess of fair value over carrying value as of the fourth quarter of ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each operating segment  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
long lived assets the company reviews property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
although the company did not record any impairment charges in related to its property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  deterioration in its business in the future could lead to such impairment charges in future periods 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives could differ from those used in calculating the expected future undiscounted cash flows  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful lives 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company provides various defined benefit pension plans for its us employees and sponsors three defined benefit healthcare and life insurance plans 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used by the company were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the moody s aa bond index and  to a lesser extent  the citigroup index  which represents a yield curve  ii the salary growth is based on the company s historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectations of future returns 
the rates used to determine the company s costs and obligations under its pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in footnote of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a basis point increase in the salary growth rate used would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when the company is made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
historically over the past three years  the company s allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in the company s current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase its allowance reserve by approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk currently  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company monitors foreign exchange and interest rate risks and manages such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
the company has various borrowing facilities where the interest rates  although not fixed  are relatively low 
currently  an increase in the associated interest rates would not significantly impact interest expense on these facilities  as the company currently has no debt 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and short term nature of the company s investment portfolio and the relative insignificance of interest income to consolidated pre tax income 
the company s financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which the company does business 
the company s primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing the company to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another  however  no such material hedges were outstanding at year end 
the company can initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively
