additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect the business  financial condition  and or operating results of the company 
the success of the business depends on the company s ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demands 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to originate and define fashion product trends  as well as to anticipate  gauge  and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
the retail business fluctuates according to consumer preferences  dictated in part by fashion and season 
decisions with respect to product designs are generally made well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases 
to the extent the company fails to anticipate  identify  and respond effectively to consumer preferences  sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect the company s operating results 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with national department stores as well as regional department store chains 
the company also competes with other specialty retailers and catalog companies 
the company is faced with a variety of competitive challenges including anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition  developing high quality merchandise in sizes  colors  and styles that appeal to consumers  appropriately managing inventory levels  sourcing merchandise efficiently  effectively marketing the company s products to consumers  and pricing the company s merchandise appropriately 
increased competition could cause the company s sales and margins to be reduced and adversely affect results of operations

jill s operations 
the company acquired j 
jill in may the company s ability to continue to grow and sustain long term profitability may depend upon effectively integrating and growing the j 
jill business 
the realization of any revenue growth  cost savings or synergies related to j 
jill will depend largely upon the company s ability to implement key design changes to the j 
jill brand merchandise that will lead to increased sales  appropriately price the j 
jill brand merchandise  open j 
jill brand stores in locations where operations will be profitable  successfully integrate back office functions  including operational  financial  and management systems and controls in a timely manner  and execute strategies for the j 
jill brand without adversely impacting the existing talbots brand 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully execute any of the actions above or that the company s strategies for the j 
jill brand will achieve the results necessary to generate profits 
if the company fails to integrate the j 
jill operations or cannot successfully execute its growth strategy  the company s results will be adversely impacted 
the company cannot assure the successful implementation of its growth strategy 
the company s continued growth depends on its ability to open and operate stores successfully and to manage the company s planned expansion 
during  the company plans to open approximately talbots brand stores and j 
jill brand stores  which is fewer stores on an annual basis than its historic trends 
the company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending  the level of sales volume and profitability at existing store locations  the availability of sufficient capital resources to effect expansion plans  the continuing availability of desirable locations  the ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms for prospective new and expanded locations  sourcing sufficient levels of inventory  hiring and training qualified management level and other associates  and integrating new stores into its existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that such expansion will be profitable or that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively 
the company incurred substantial debt to finance the j 
jill acquisition 
in february  the company entered into a million bridge loan agreement in connection with its planned acquisition of j 
jill 
in july  the bridge loan was converted into a term loan the acquisition debt to be repaid in equal quarterly installments over a five year period 
additionally  since the acquisition  borrowings under the company s short term facilities have been higher than it has historically experienced in order to meet current cash needs 
the company s ability to satisfy its obligations and to reduce its total debt depends on the company s future operating performance 
the company s business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations 
if the company is unable to service its debt and fund its business  the company may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  or seek additional financing or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash requirements will be met by existing available borrowing facilities 
additionally  the company s outstanding debt accrues interest at variable rates  therefore interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
restrictions in the company s acquisition loan agreement may limit its activities 
the company s acquisition loan agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit the company s ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit it  including restrictions on the company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  make investments  
table of contents create liens  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate  or merge 
the company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of its acquisition loan agreement 
the company s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on its future performance 
the company s failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under its acquisition loan agreement  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require the company to repay that debt before its scheduled due date 
if an event of default occurs  the company may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under its indebtedness 
the company cannot assure a successful search for mr 
zetcher s successor as chief executive officer 
on february   arnold b 
zetcher announced his plan to retire as president and chief executive officer of the company at the end of fiscal  and the company has announced that a search committee has been established and is functioning in its search for mr 
zetcher s successor 
mr 
zetcher has been the chief executive officer of the company for nearly years 
there can be no assurance that a successor will be found in an appropriate time period 
the company experiences fluctuations in comparable store sales results 
comparable stores are those that were open for at least one full fiscal year 
when a new talbots petites store  talbots woman store  or talbots accessories shoes store is opened adjacent to or in close proximity to an existing comparable misses store  such misses store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of months so that the performance of the full misses assortment may be properly compared 
the company s comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past on a monthly  quarterly  and annual basis  and are expected to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect comparable store sales results  including changes in fashion trends  timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events  changes in the company s merchandise mix  timing of catalog mailings  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions  and general economic conditions 
past comparable store sales are not an indicator of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 
the company s comparable store sales performance is likely to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in operating results 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
among the factors that may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate are customers response to merchandise offerings  the timing of the rollout of new stores  seasonal variations in sales  the timing and size of catalog mailings  the costs of producing and mailing catalogs  the timing of merchandise receipts  the level of merchandise returns  changes in merchandise mix and presentation  the company s cost of merchandise  unanticipated operating costs  and other factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors 
as a result of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
if the company fails to maintain the value of its brands  sales are likely to decline 
the company s success depends on the value of the talbots and j 
jill brands 
the talbots brand name and classic niche is integral to the success of the brand s business 
maintaining  promoting  and positioning the talbots brand will depend largely on the success of the company s marketing and merchandising efforts and the ability to provide a consistent  high quality customer experience 
the talbots brand could be adversely affected if the company fails to achieve these objectives or if the company s public image is tarnished by negative publicity 

table of contents the company s success depends upon its ability to effectively define  evolve and promote the j 
jill brand 
with the implementation of new merchandising leadership  the company has begun to implement initiatives to improve the brand s merchandise 
in addition  the company is taking steps designed to further develop the brand through client research  in store and direct marketing 
while the company believes that the changes will help to build brand awareness and attract new customers  the company cannot provide assurance that they will result in increased sales or profitability in the future 
the company cannot assure that it will be successful in introducing new business concepts that will result in increased profitability for the company 
the company has introduced new business concepts within the talbots brand  including talbots petites  talbots kids  talbots accessories shoes  talbots woman  talbots woman petites  talbots collection  and talbots mens 
the company may introduce new business concepts in the future  either under the talbots or j 
jill brand 
there can be no assurance that these new concepts will be successful or that the company s overall profitability will increase as a result of introducing these concepts 
the company cannot assure that internet sales will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth 
the company sells merchandise over the internet through its websites  www 
talbots 
com and www 
jjill 
com 
the company s internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures  and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
the internet operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on the company s results of operations  including potential electronic break ins or other security breaches  hiring  retention and training of personnel to conduct the company s internet operations  diversion of sales from the company s stores  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  violations of state or federal privacy laws  and risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and similar disruptions 
there can be no assurance that the company s internet operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth or even remain at their current level 
the company could be adversely affected if any of its distribution centers are shut down 
the company operates store distribution and catalog fulfillment facilities in lakeville  massachusetts  and tilton  new hampshire for all of its us stores and worldwide catalog operations 
if one center were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason  the other center may not be able to adequately support the resulting additional distribution and fulfillment demands  in part because of capacity constraints and in part because each center services a particular brand 
as a result  the company could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to its stores and or fulfill catalog and internet orders  which could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
talented personnel are critical to the company s success 
the company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends to a significant extent on both the performance of its current executive and senior management team and its ability to attract  hire  motivate  and retain additional qualified and talented management personnel in the future 
the company s inability to recruit and retain such personnel  or the loss of services of any of its current key employees  could adversely impact the company s operations 
the company s overseas merchandise purchasing strategy makes it vulnerable to a number of risks 
the company purchases a significant portion of its merchandise directly from foreign sources 
approximately of the talbots brand merchandise and of the j 
jill brand merchandise purchased in was purchased directly from foreign sources 
in addition  goods purchased from domestic vendors may be sourced abroad by such 
table of contents vendors 
as a result  the company s business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political instability  imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods that may be imported into the us from countries in a region where the company does business  imposition of duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  natural disasters and public health concerns  potential delays or disruption in shipping and related pricing impacts  and local business practices and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
the company cannot predict whether the foreign countries in which the company s apparel and accessories are currently manufactured or any of the foreign countries in which the company s apparel and accessories may be manufactured in the future will be subject to import restrictions by the us government  including the likelihood  type or effect of any trade retaliation 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or more restrictive quotas  applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel and  in that event  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to the company and adversely affect the company s operations 
a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items which could adversely affect the company s sales 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industry  including general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  employment levels  political conditions such as war  terrorism and political unrest  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items may decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is lower 
a downturn in the economies in which the company sells its products  whether in the us or abroad  may adversely affect the company s operations 
a major failure of the company s information systems could harm the business 
the company depends on information systems to manage its operations 
the company s information systems consist of a full range of retail  financial  and merchandising systems  including credit  inventory distribution and control  sales reporting  accounts payable  budgeting and forecasting  financial reporting  merchandise reporting  and distribution 
the company regularly makes investments to upgrade  enhance  or replace such systems 
any delays or difficulties in transitioning to these new systems  or in integrating these systems with the company s current systems  or any other disruptions affecting the company s information systems  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 

table of contents the market price of the company s common stock is volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or disclosures concerning the company or its competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by the company or by analysts  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets  in general  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies

the company s well balanced assortment of updated modern classic merchandise coupled with the implementation of its key initiatives contributed to stronger top line sales throughout the middle portion of the year 
these key initiatives included increasing its style count to provide greater choices and diversity to customers  sharpening price points across virtually all categories of merchandise  and changing its markdown strategy and merchandise flow in the third quarter 
the merchandise offerings and initiatives proved to be a success as the talbots brand experienced six months of healthy comparable store sales  or growth over the prior year for the months of april through september 
this positive sales momentum fueled the company s optimism for sustained strength for the brand through the balance of the year  which proved to be far more challenging 
the company saw comparable store sales for the talbots brand drop off unexpectedly in the fourth quarter  a decline of in comparison to the same period of the prior year  which led to higher levels of markdown merchandise and deeper discounts towards the end of the fourth quarter 
the company was pleased with the growth it experienced in from its talbots woman and kids concepts  with comparable store sales increases for the year of in talbots us woman and in kids 
to increase awareness and penetration of the talbots woman concept  the company opened talbots woman stores and added talbots woman departments to existing misses stores in for the j

the company has executed certain key initiatives which management believes have contributed to improved comparable store sales  such as making adjustments to the color offering of merchandise  offering the customer a more consistent price structure across virtually all merchandise classifications  and unifying the promotional and marketing calendars 
the overall effect of implementing these initiatives is expected to be more fully realized in with the acquisition of j 
jill  the company acquired j 
jill s direct marketing business  which consists of both catalog and internet channels 
the acquired business primarily contributed to the growth in the combined direct marketing business over the prior year 
internet sales across both brands accounted for approximately of total direct marketing sales  up from in for the talbots brand only 

table of contents total inventories at the end of were million  an increase of from million at the end of the increase was partially due to the million acquired inventory with the acquisition of j 
jill 
also contributing to the increase was the higher level of in transit inventory in due to timing of spring deliveries 
finally  because the company had experienced strong sales toward the start of the fall selling season  the company increased its inventory commitments 
the anticipated strong sales did not continue into the fourth quarter  therefore  at year end  inventory levels were elevated 
for  the company is currently planning for per square foot inventories to be flat on average in the spring season 
customer accounts receivable at the end of were million  down from at the end of  primarily due to the fact that ended one week later than allowing customers an extra week to make payments against holiday purchases

jill brand name  which is below the company s recent historical rate of store expansion 
the additional talbots brand stores will primarily be in its misses  petites  and woman concepts 
the company will continue to study the kids  mens  and collection concepts further for their expansion potential

jill brand net direct marketing sales total company total net sales net sales in were  million compared to net sales of  an increase of million  or 
talbots brand retail stores the million  or  increase in talbots brand retail store sales was driven by two factors 
first  driving increased sales was the increase in the number of talbots brand stores 
as of february   the company 
table of contents operated a total of  talbots brand stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
this represents an increase of approximately in gross and selling square footage from january   when the company operated  stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
secondly  reflected in retail stores sales was a million  or  increase in comparable stores sales 
comparable store sales were strong during the april to september period  these months representing a combined increase over the prior year  offset by declines in the other months 
management believes that comparable store sales were primarily driven by the brand s improved classic merchandise offering during the period  as well as certain key initiatives put into place during the third quarter  such as offering its customer more choices and diversity by increasing style count  sharpening price points across virtually all categories of merchandise  and responding to the customers buying patterns and adjusting the company s marketing and promotional calendar 
due to the success of the early fall season  the company anticipated continued strong sales trends for the fourth quarter and therefore increased inventory purchases 
the fourth quarter sales trends were lower than anticipated leading to higher levels of markdown merchandise and deeper discounts during the fourth quarter 
additionally  management believes that the timing of promotions  underperforming catalogs  as well as adverse weather conditions in key markets led to decreased customer traffic and declines in comparable store sales in february and march of j 
jill brand retail stores as of february   the company operated j 
jill brand retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million and million  respectively 
since the date of acquisition  may   the company has opened j 
jill brand stores 
the j 
jill brand s retail store sales reflected a decline in comparable store sales since the date of acquisition compared to the same period of the prior year  which management believes was a continuation of sales trends resulting from strategies put in place prior to the acquisition 
specifically  management believes that comparable store sales were influenced by a weak top line performance of merchandise that was not brand appropriate  which negatively impacted regular and markdown selling for the brand 
additionally  management believes that a number of significant shifts in the promotional calendar  as well as the reduction in catalog circulation during the period  led to decreased customer traffic and spending resulting in lower than expected retail sales for the brand 
the company has seen a sequential quarterly improvement during in comparable store sales performance since the date of acquisition  with the fourth quarter yielding positive comparable store sales results 
the company executed certain key initiatives which management believes assisted in improved comparable store sales  such as making adjustments to the color offering of the merchandise  offering the customer a more consistent price structure across all merchandise classifications  and unifying the promotional and marketing calendars 
management expects to see the greater impact from these initiatives in direct marketing sales the million  or  increase in direct marketing sales is primarily attributable to the acquired catalog and internet business of the j

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the applicable balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the applicable reporting periods 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  and purchase price allocation 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results would differ from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 
inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant asset on the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at february  the company manages its talbots brand inventory levels by typically holding four major sale events per year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
in  the company added a fifth minor clearance sales event in august to offer customers transitional merchandise at a more relevant  wear now time 
no other major promotional sale events are typically held  however a sixth minor sales event was added in february these events serve to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods are transferred to the talbots brand outlet stores 
the company has managed its j 
jill brand inventory levels by internal and external liquidation vehicles 
internet channels  including sales catalogs  price reductions in the retail stores and the j 
jill brand outlet stores are utilized first 
after the internal capacity is exceeded  external channels such as discount marketers and inventory liquidators have been utilized 
at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown past season inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise based on historical markdown percentages 
these percentages are reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
if market conditions were to decline or customer acceptance of product was not favorable  the company may be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
management believes that at february  and january   the markdown reserve was reasonable based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and forecasts of future sales of markdown inventory 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management 
table of contents estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six or twelve month period and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six or twelve month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the direct marketing component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
management believes that at february  and january   the reserve was sufficient based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
the company maintains a customer loyalty program in which talbots us brand customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each one dollar of purchase 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year the customer is issued a twenty five dollar appreciation award 
typically  the company runs two promotional events  in march and september  where the customer is credited two points for each one dollar purchased 
in and  the company also offered this promotion in december 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
each month  the company performs an analysis of the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned 
the company also performs a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes that at february  and january   its accrual was sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
retirement plans 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time talbots brand employees  two non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain talbots brand key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and provides certain medical benefits for most talbots brand retired employees under postretirement medical plans 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the plans are valued annually as of december st 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plans 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based  in part  upon a discount rate modeling process that involves selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds rated aa or higher with maturities that match the cash flows of the plan 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s obligation and periodic expense pursuant to its employee benefits plans 
at december  and  the discount rate used 
table of contents was and  respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based on an analysis which considers actual net returns for the pension plan since inception  ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the two major classes of investments in which the company invests debt and equity securities for the period since the pension plan s inception and for the longer period commencing when the return data was first tracked  and expectations of future market returns from outside sources for the two major classes of investments in which the company invests 
this rate is utilized primarily in estimating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately five years 
during both and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
the company utilized a rate of for both the periods beginning december  and december  this rate is utilized principally in estimating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plans 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at december  and  the company used and  respectively  as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  the company s obligation and associated expense are increased or decreased accordingly 
at december  and  management believes that the assumptions used in the calculation of its retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically reviews the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
the company monitors the carrying value of its assets for potential impairment based primarily on projected future cash flows 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment is recorded as appropriate 
impairment losses are significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
while the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows could affect the company s evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to goodwill and trademarks and reviews annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the company has elected the first day of each fiscal year as its annual measurement date 
no impairment charges were recorded during the fiscal years ending february   january   and january  in assessing impairment for goodwill and trademarks  the company uses a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
the evaluation of goodwill and trademarks requires the company to use significant judgments and estimates  including  but not limited to  projected future revenues  cash flows  and discount rates  the company believes that  based on current conditions  material goodwill and intangible impairments are not likely to occur 
however  a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of material impairment 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in response to this  management records accruals for estimates of audit adjustments and associated interest  where applicable 
the eventual resolution of these audits might include increases or decreases in liabilities 
management believes that at february  and january   the accruals for income taxes were reasonable 

table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicated it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
in implementing fin no 
 the company will need to evaluate each tax benefit using these evaluation methods and will need to make judgments on how to disaggregate its various tax positions and then analyze the tax positions 
the provisions of fin no 
will be effective for the company commencing at the start of fiscal  february  upon initial adoption of fin no 
 the company will recognize the cumulative effect of fin no 
as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the company is evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r 
to calculate the fair value of options  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated expected volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  the expected dividend rate  and the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon bond issues with a term approximately equal to the expected life of the options 
in addition  an estimated forfeiture rate is applied in the recognition of the compensation charge 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount of expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the future impact of the cost of share based compensation on our results of operations  including net income and earnings per diluted share  will depend on  among other factors  the level of our equity awards as well as the market price of our shares at the time of award as well as various other assumptions used in valuing such awards 
purchase price allocation 
the company accounted for its acquisition of j 
jill under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which provides that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition  and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the acquisition of j 
jill was completed in may for a total purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million 
the company has finalized its determination of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
as part of the purchase price allocations  all intangible assets were identified and valued 
of the total purchase price  million was assigned to trademarks  and million was assigned to other intangible assets using income and cost approaches 
if the company had utilized different valuation techniques and assumptions  the assigned values and assigned useful lives may have varied significantly  causing goodwill and the amortization expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings to be significantly impacted
