the organic sales growth was primarily driven by growth in european and developing economies  growth in the distribution and general engineering markets and favorable conditions in certain other markets  particularly in the energy and mining markets 
these increases in sales were partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of million  primarily the divestiture of j l 
sales of  million in increased percent versus  million in the increase in sales was primarily attributed to organic sales growth of million and incremental sales due to acquisitions of million

asset impairment charges during  we completed our strategic analysis and plan for our widia brand 
as a key element of our channel and brand strategy  we will leverage the strength of this brand to accelerate growth in the distribution market 
since demand in the distribution market is mostly for standard products and to further our relationship with our widia distributors  we intend to migrate direct sales of widia custom solutions products to the kennametal brand 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to our mssg widia trademark during the third quarter of in  we did not incur any impairment charges with respect to our continuing operations

amortization of intangibles amortization expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the impact of our business acquisitions 
amortization expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributed to the acquisition of extrude hone effective march  interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in compared with million in this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in average domestic borrowings partially offset by the impact of higher average borrowing rates 
the weighted average domestic borrowing rate increased from percent in to percent in due primarily to repayments of lower cost floating rate debt during the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively

other income  net for and included fees of million and million  respectively  related to the accounts receivable securitization program 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the decrease in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by the continuing operational performance of our pan european centralized business model  a favorable valuation allowance adjustment related to net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes  unfavorable permanent differences in related to the j l divestiture and income tax expense in associated with cash repatriated under the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the impact of these items was partially offset by a tax charge recognized in for tax contingencies in europe  as well as the favorable resolution of tax contingencies in that were primarily related to a research and development credit claim 
during  we implemented an enhanced pan european centralized business model  which involved the establishment of a principal company 
in this structure  key management decision making and responsibility are centralized in the principal company that maintains the responsibility to drive all strategic and operational initiatives of the european business 
manufacturing and sales operations have been transformed into toll manufacturers and limited risk distributors 
service functions have also been organized into separate units 
this enables these functions to intensify their focus on and increase their efficiency in production  sales growth and supporting services  following clearly defined and uniform processes as directed by the principal company 
on october   the ajca was enacted 
during  we completed our evaluation of a provision within the ajca that provides for a special one time deduction of percent of foreign earnings that are repatriated to the united states  as defined by the ajca  and repatriated million of foreign earnings under the ajca 
notwithstanding this one time repatriation  we maintain that the unremitted earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection therewith 

table of contents the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the increase in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by permanent differences related to the divestiture of j l  the income tax expense associated with cash repatriated under the ajca  impairment charges related to the divestiture of presto for which tax benefits could not be recognized  and the impact of adopting sfas r 
the impact of these items was partially reduced by a favorable resolution of tax contingencies with the internal revenue service  which was primarily related to a research and development tax credit claim  the favorable effect of operating under our new business model in europe  and reversal of a valuation allowance that resulted from a change in circumstances that caused a change in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in europe 
during the first quarter of  the german government enacted a tax reform bill that included a reduction of its corporate income tax rate 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we will adjust the balance of our net deferred tax assets in germany for the effect of this change in tax rate  which will be an increase to deferred tax expense of approximately million 
we expect the impact of this tax rate change will have a favorable effect on our effective tax rate on a prospective basis  however  we do not expect the impact will be material to our results of operations or financial condition

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and internal growth 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs throughout changes in the economic cycle 
in march  we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen

borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  we obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million of notes payable and million of term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  approximately percent and percent of our debt  respectively  was exposed to variable rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for variable versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of variable to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it

discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer  and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and prior to the divestiture in  fss management contracts contained two major deliverables product procurement and inventory management 
under the fixed fee contracts  we recognized revenue evenly over the contract term 
revenue was recognized upon shipment for cost plus contracts 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for unvested awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r on july  we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish fair value of all awards 

table of contents accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
this evaluation is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would increase or decrease our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care costs is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would decrease or increase our pre tax income by million and million  respectively 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 

table of contents income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
eitf requires that tax benefits generated by dividends paid during the vesting period on certain equity classified share based compensation awards be classified as additional paid in capital and included in a pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies from share based payment awards 
eitf is effective for kennametal on july  and is to be applied on a prospective basis 
we are in the process of evaluating the provisions of this eitf to determine the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to measure many financial instruments at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for kennametal as of july  we are in the process of evaluating the provisions of sfas to determine the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income of a business entity in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the funded status of each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is currently measured as of june we adopted sfas effective june  the provisions of sfas are to be applied on a prospective basis  therefore  prior periods presented have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas had the following impacts on our consolidated balance sheet a million reduction in intangible assets  a million increase in long term deferred tax assets  a million reduction in other long term assets  an million increase in other current liabilities  a million reduction in long term deferred tax liabilities  a million reduction in accrued postretirement benefits  a million reduction in accrued pension benefits and a million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item for required disclosure

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility for both earnings and cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income  net in the current period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have paid million and million at june  and  respectively  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these agreements 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
the outstanding agreements mature in june of we would have received million and million at june  and  respectively  to settle these interest rate swap agreements  which represents the fair value of these agreements 

table of contents fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to variable interest rates 
these agreements mature in june but provide for a one time optional early termination for the bank counterparty in june at the then prevailing market value of the swap agreements 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt  including capital leases and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have materially increased earnings in  reduced earnings in and increased earnings in as compared to the prior year periods 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
