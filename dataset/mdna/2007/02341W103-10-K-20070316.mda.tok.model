item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  specialty minerals company and earn our revenues and profits from a diverse group of industrial and consumer product lines 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the united states  australia and china 
additionally  through our affiliates and joint ventures  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india and mexico 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which require us to identify which markets our reserves can serve 
we believe that our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are the core components of our longevity and future prospects 
we operate in five segments minerals  environmental  oilfield services  transportation and corporate 
prior to the third quarter of  we did not report our oilfield services business as a separate segment 
this business was included as part of our environmental segment 
in the third quarter of  we reorganized how we view and manage our business 
we began capturing discrete financial information for our oilfield services business and reporting it separately to management 
as a result  commencing in the third quarter of  we recognized oilfield services as a stand alone segment  separate from our environmental segment 
we have revised the segment information for prior periods to conform to this new presentation 
both our minerals and environmental segments operate manufacturing facilities in north america  europe  and asia pacific regions 
our oilfield services segment operates principally in north america  europe and africa 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that performs trucking services for our domestic minerals and environmental businesses as well as third parties 
our customers are engaged in varied end markets and geographies 
customers in the minerals segment range from foundries that produce castings for automotive  industrial  and transportation equipment  including heavy duty trucks and railroad cars  to producers of consumer goods  including cat box filler  cosmetics and detergents 
the customers for our lining technologies and building materials products are predominantly engineering contractors 
the oilfield services customer base is primarily comprised of oil and gas service or exploration companies 
a significant portion of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our business is performed under short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
approximately of our revenue is generated in north america  consequently  the state of the us economy impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in the asia pacific and european regions  which have continued to outpace the united states in economic growth 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we employ a number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal o organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have a history of commitment to research and development and using this resource to bring innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 
o globalization we have expanded our manufacturing and marketing organizations into europe and asia pacific over the last years 
this operating experience enables us to expand further into emerging markets 
we see the significant opportunities in the asia pacific region for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow 
we expect to take advantage of these growth areas either through our wholly owned subsidiaries or investments in affiliates and joint ventures 
o mineral development bentonite is a component in a majority of the products we produce 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure that new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 
o acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to add complementary businesses to our portfolio of products 
in  we acquired a number of businesses for a total cost of approximately million 
a strong financial position will enable us to continue to acquire businesses which  in our assessment  are valued fairly and fit with our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in general  the significance of these risks has not changed over the past year 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our financial statements are based in part upon critical accounting policies that involve complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our selection of accounting policies has resulted in actual results approximating the estimated amounts in each respective area 
these policies are discussed below and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
our process to evaluate inventories for excess or obsolete items is comprehensive 
we quantify the amount of inventory on hand that  based on projected demand  is not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  is excess or obsolete 
this involves a review by sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets we have made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and have a moderate investment in goodwill 
for property  plant and equipment  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  we perform an annual impairment assessment at the reporting unit level or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in analyzing the fair value of each reporting unit and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  management uses models which are based on estimates of future operating performance and related cash flows 
in preparing these models  management must make estimates in projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  in selecting a discount rate that reflects the related business risks  and in determining the appropriate perpetuity or disposal value 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
our estimates related to the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our united states employees hired on or before december  in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  we must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with our actuaries 
to determine our net accrued benefit and net periodic benefit cost  we form judgments about the best estimate for each assumption used in the actuarial computation 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield of a standardized benchmark  the moody s aa corporate bond index  which consists of high quality fixed income investments  and round it to the nearest basis points 
the discount rate used to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at september   was 
a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation at december  by million and would increase net cost expected in by  or thousand 
likewise at december   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by million and would decrease the net cost expected in by  or thousand 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the historical long term performance  as adjusted for existing market conditions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
we assumed a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of to determine our net benefit cost in a basis point decrease in the expected return would increase the net cost expected in by approximately  or thousand 
likewise  a basis point increase in the expected return would decrease the net cost expected in by thousand 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe our positions may be overturned 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
our estimates of income tax items  expense and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
valuation allowances are recorded  if necessary  to measure a deferred tax asset at an estimated realizable value 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
changes in a valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we determine events have occurred that will impact the realizable value of the asset 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve or valuation allowance  is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our united states federal income tax returns have been completed for our income tax returns relating to fiscal years of and prior 
state income tax returns are audited more infrequently 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recording of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution

metalcasting sales principally increased due to an acquisition completed in october 
after factoring out the acquisition  domestic sales declined due to lower volumes of specialty products 
asia pacific sales increased due to continued market expansion  particularly in china 
specialty minerals revenues increased due to higher pricing and volume levels for oil and gas drilling fluid additives along with increased market penetration for health and beauty product lines 
detergent additives volumes declined in lower volumes due to customer losses led to decreased pet products sales 
gross profit improved with the increase in net sales  however  gross margin declined by basis points

income taxes the effective income tax rate for was  compared with in and in a schedule reconciling the us federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense was positively impacted in by completion of audits of amended income tax returns filed in  as described below 
the result was a reduction in our tax contingency reserves of approximately million 
in addition  we estimated higher depletion deductions in and reported more of our earnings from overseas subsidiaries  which have lower average income tax rates 
the largest benefit to the tax rate in was higher depletion deductions  lower average foreign tax rates and reductions in estimates of taxes payable which were determined in conjunction with preparation of the income tax returns in in  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of million associated with depletion deductions and research and development credits available in computing income tax expense 
approximately million of this amount relates to changes in estimates resulting from the finalization  in  of the tax return for the tax year 
the remaining million relates to the filing of amended federal income tax returns dating from through regarding the amended income tax returns  after consultation with tax advisors  we recomputed our federal income tax liability for these periods after determining that we could increase certain deductions and credits as allowed under the internal revenue code 
the total refund claimed on the returns was million  however  we determined that a contingency reserve was necessary to reflect potential reduction of the refund after examination of the returns by the irs 
no adjustments were recorded in to the contingency reserve established for these refund claims 
we also recorded  in  a million credit to income tax expense for the adjustment of deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable at a uk subsidiary

the major component of the increase for each of the last two years was largely related to our investments in two businesses based in india  we own of the larger business and of the other 
the larger business has substantial bauxite and bentonite operations 
bauxite is used to produce alumina  which is then used to produce aluminum 
the bauxite business had particularly strong earnings over the last two years 
the second business in india is engaged in manufacturing  marketing and distributing a specialized bentonite application involving clarification of edible oils 
that business has continued to increase its profits over the last two years 
discontinued operations in july  the internal revenue service completed audits of amended income tax returns which were filed in but relate to years prior to and are described in the income tax section of this report 
we accounted for million of the settlement as interest income related to that portion of the settlement as a discontinued operation since it related to a business we sold in in september  we filed an amended income tax return in the state of mississippi requesting a refund of approximately million of taxes paid relating to the gain on the sale of our absorbent polymer segment 
the sale of the segment was reported as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of with the assistance of a professional accounting firm  we concluded that a gain on the sale of a business under these circumstances was not taxable in mississippi according to its laws 
after negotiations and hearings with officials  the board of review of the mississippi state tax commission accepted our settlement offer of million in june  and we received payment of this refund in july net income net income for was million compared with million and million in and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations  borrowings from a revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees have been our sources of funds to purchase property  plant and equipment  acquire businesses  repurchase common stock  and pay dividends to shareholders 
effective march   we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase our borrowing capacity from million to million  all other substantive terms and conditions remained the same 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowing capabilities are adequate to support our operating plans for the next to months 
following is a discussion and analysis of our cash flow activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows within item of this report 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in was million  compared with million in and million in the improvements in and largely result from greater income from continuing operations

net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million in  compared with and million in and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in both comparable periods was due to a number of new sites including a metalcasting products plant in china  a lining technologies manufacturing plant in spain and infrastructure investments at our us mining site facilities 
acquisitions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we acquired three businesses 
two of the businesses are included within our oilfield services segment and the other in the minerals segment 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities was million in financing cash flows are primarily affected by borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we had net borrowings from the revolving credit facility totaling million and million in and  respectively 
net borrowings were negligible in the increase in borrowings in and was attributed to acquisitions as well capital expenditures 
as noted in item of this form k  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock in compared with million in and million in we elect to repurchase our common stock in the open market from time to time when we believe utilizing funds in this manner will provide a good return to our shareholders 
we have up to million of funds authorized by our board of directors to use for stock repurchases until november  dividends on our common stock were million in  compared with million in and million in declared dividends were per share in  compared with per share in and per share in as of december   we had outstanding debt of million and cash of million  compared with million of outstanding debt and million of cash at december  total funded debt represented  and of total capitalization at december   and  respectively 
working capital was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities was to and to as of the end of and  respectively 
greater sales generated by our international businesses resulted in increased working capital in since customer payment terms tend to be longer in those areas 
since the mid s  we and or our subsidiaries have been named as one of a number of defendants in product liability lawsuits relating to the minor free silica content of our bentonite products used in the metalcasting industry 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are primarily employees of our foundry customers 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs in defending these matters 
we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and do not believe the litigation will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  liquidity or results of the operations

long term debt includes bank debt of approximately million due under a revolving credit agreement  which provides for a commitment of million in borrowing capacity and matures on october  effective march   we amended this revolving credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million and extend the maturity to april   all other substantive terms and conditions remained the same 
the agreement is a multi currency arrangement that allows us to borrow certain foreign currencies at rates that can range from to above the london inter bank offered rate libor  depending upon the amount of the credit line used and certain capitalization ratios

such payments are excluded from the above table as they are entered into in the ordinary course of business  and we believe the anticipated expenditures associated with them are not material 
we have recorded million of liabilities to satisfy the land reclamation obligations discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenditures to satisfy these liabilities are excluded from the above table of contractual obligations as the timing of these payments are not contractually due until the expiration of individual mining permits  which are frequently renewed 
we anticipate our funding obligation for our defined benefit pension plan will approximate million in that amount principally represents contributions required by regulations or laws 
we have not presented this obligation or the obligation for future years in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in fair value of pension plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
at december  and  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively  which are not included in the obligations in the table above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world  we are subject to certain market risks  including those related to foreign currency  interest rates and government actions 
we use a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments only for risk management and do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound  and the polish zloty 
we also have significant exposure to changes in exchange rates between the british pound and the euro and the polish zloty and the euro 
our various currency exposures often offset each other  providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
periodically  specific foreign currency transactions eg inventory purchases are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk 
as of december   we did not have any material foreign currency contracts outstanding

these instruments allow us to change the characteristics of variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate 
interest rate differentials are paid or received on these arrangements over the life of the agreements 
at the end of and  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base 
we currently believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
our accounts receivable financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair value
