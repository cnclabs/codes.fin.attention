item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have developed a broad line of pre programmed universal wireless control products and audio video accessories that are marketed to enhance home entertainment systems 
our channels of distribution include international retail  us retail  private label  oems  cable and satellite service providers  cedia  and companies in the computing industry 
we believe that our universal remote control database contains device codes that are capable of controlling virtually all infrared remote ir controlled tvs  vcrs  dvd players  cable converters  cd players  audio components and satellite receivers  as well as most other infrared remote controlled devices worldwide 
beginning in and continuing today  we have compiled an extensive library that covers nearly  individual device functions and over  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
our library is regularly updated with new ir codes used in newly introduced video and audio devices 
all such ir codes are captured from the original manufacturer s remote control devices or manufacturer s specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
we have also developed patented technologies that provide the capability to easily upgrade the memory of the wireless control device by adding ir codes from the library that were not originally included 
in the second quarter of  we introduced a new product named nevosl 
nevosl is a universal controller that delivers complete audio  visual and wi fi digital media control for the networked home 
in  we continued to enhance our product lines by introducing nevostudio  an update to our software suite for nevosl 
from october  through december   we acquired over of the outstanding shares of simpledevices  inc simpledevices for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  plus a performance based payment of our unregistered common stock to be paid in the first quarter of if certain financial objectives were achieved 
the performance based payment was not reflected as part of the purchase price as of december   since the performance metrics were not met 
the value we received from this acquisition relates primarily to simpledevices unique capabilities  as well as its complete and in process technology 
simpledevices has developed connected device technology solutions that link the home computer and the internet to existing consumer electronic devices in the home and car 
the company provides upnp compatible software to transform common home devices into connected devices that is  devices that can find  control and share entertainment media across a home network 
upnp is an architecture for pervasive peer to peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances  wireless devices and pcs of all form factors 
it is designed to bring standards based connectivity to ad hoc or unmanaged networks  whether in the home  in a small business  in public spaces or attached to the internet 
upnp is a distributed  open networking architecture that leverages tcp ip and web technologies to enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control and data transfer among networked devices in the home  office and public spaces 
since acquiring simpledevices  we have integrated  and in certain respects improved upon  simpledevices technologies with and into our own technology  resulting in the creation of new wireless control devices that will allow for media control 
moreover  through this integration of technologies  we have improved and expanded our relationships with our customers and with simpledevices customers  resulting in more cross selling of products and technology 
in addition  we have integrated simpledevices sales  engineering and administrative functions into our own  resulting in both operational efficiencies and cost savings 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranties  inventory valuation  business combination purchase price allocations  our review for impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
actual results may differ from the estimates  and these estimates may be adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustment could be significant 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of products when delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
the provision recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the period the related revenue is recorded 
we accrue for discounts and rebates on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded based on historical experience 
changes in such accruals may be required if future rebates and incentives differ from our estimates 
rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized as cost of sales if we provide products or services for payment 
sales allowances reduce gross accounts receivable to arrive at accounts receivable  net in the same period the related receivable is recorded 
we have no obligations after delivery of our products other than the associated warranties 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a variety of factors  including historical experience  length of time receivables are past due  current economic trends and changes in customer payment behavior 
also  we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to a customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of the receivables would be further adjusted  either upward or downward 
we generate service revenue  which is paid monthly  as a result of providing consumer support programs to some of our customers through our call centers 
these service revenues are recognized when services are performed  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also license our intellectual property including our patented technologies  trade secrets  trademarks  and database of infrared codes 
we record license revenue when our customers ship products incorporating our intellectual property  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value 
the fair values for the multiple elements are determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  or the price charged when the element is sold separately 
the residual method is utilized when vsoe exists for all the undelivered elements  but not for the delivered element 
this is performed by allocating revenue to the undelivered elements that have vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
when the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we account for revenue under software licensing arrangements involving significant production  modification or customization of software in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
when applying the percentage of completion method  we rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue and labor hours which are provided by our project managers 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and labor applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known  and losses are accrued when identified 
warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship arising during normal use 
we service warranty claims directly through our customer service department or contracted third party warranty repair facilities 
our warranty period ranges up to three years 
we provide for estimated product warranty expenses  which are included in cost of sales  as we sell the related products 
because warranty expense is a forecast based on the best available information  primarily historical claims experience  actual claim costs may differ from the amounts provided 
if a significant product defect were to be discovered on a high volume product  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
historically  product defects have been less than of net sales units 
each change in the ratio of product defects to net sales units impacts the warranty reserve and cost of sales by approximately thousand 
inventories our inventories consist of wireless control devices  including but not limited to universal remote controls  antennas and integrated circuits and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we carry inventory in amounts necessary to satisfy our customers inventory requirements on a timely basis 
new product innovations and technological advances may shorten a given product s life cycle 
we continually monitor our inventory status to control inventory levels and dispose of any excess or obsolete inventories on hand 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory s cost and its estimated market value based upon our best estimates about future demand and market conditions 
if 
table of contents actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  new technology is developed that renders our products obsolete or significant price decreases occur in component parts  such as integrated circuits  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
our total excess and obsolete inventory reserve as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively  or and of total inventory 
each change in the ratio of excess and obsolete inventory reserve to inventory would impact cost of sales by approximately thousand 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
in october  we purchased simpledevices  for approximately million  including direct acquisition costs  the purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer contracts  developed and core technology and trade names 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future free cash flow from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and cash flows from the products once they are completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates utilized in discounted cash flow models 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we assess long lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review if significant include the following underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  changes in the strategy of our overall business  negative industry or economic trends  a decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset or an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we perform an impairment review 
if the carrying value of the asset is larger than the undiscounted cash flows  the 
table of contents asset is impaired 
we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available  and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
our domestic and international operations represent components of the core business segment 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we must provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  we provide for tax liabilities when we believe such liabilities are probable under sfas  accounting for contingent liabilities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 

table of contents stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore we have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards granted after january  or granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize such compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures  but only for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of three to four years 
in march  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based compensation for public companies 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for options granted under these plans using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas under the intrinsic value method of apb  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we grant options with an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant  therefore no compensation expense was recognized related to those options for the and fiscal years 
we issue restricted stock awards to the outside directors for services performed 
under both apb no 
and sfas no 
r  compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the shares awarded as of the grant date 
compensation expense for the restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of one year 
the fair value of nonvested shares is determined based on the closing trade price of the company s shares on the grant date 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  companies may no longer account for unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock awards as deferred compensation 
sfas no 
r requires that any existing balance of deferred compensation as of the adoption date be reclassified to additional paid in capital 
because the company adopted sfas no 
r on the modified prospective basis  results from prior periods have not been restated to conform to the current presentation 
during the year ended  and  restricted shares totaling   and  were issued  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is presented in the same income statement line as cash compensation paid to the same employees or directors 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in pre tax stock based compensation expense 
included in sg a stock based compensation expense is million in pre tax stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock 
the stock based compensation expense was attributable to the following december  in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense before income taxes the total amount of stock based compensation expense related to non vested awards not yet recognized as of december  was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average life of years 
additionally  the total amount of compensation expense related to non vested restricted awards not yet recognized as of december  was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average life of months 

table of contents determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the utilization of highly subjective assumptions  including with respect to the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management determined that historical volatility calculated based on our actively traded common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the amount of stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount recorded 
if the forfeiture rate decreased by  stock based compensation expense would have increased by approximately million for the year ended december  in  we granted  stock options to employees 
due to the minimal amount of stock options granted in  our stock based compensation expense relating to these stock options will not be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in this increase in sales resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in remote control sales volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators and market share gains with a few key subscription broadcasting customers 
these advanced functions include digital video recording dvr  video on demand vod  and high definition television hdtv 
we expect that the 
table of contents deployment of the advanced function set top boxes by the service operators will continue into the foreseeable future as penetration for each of the functions cited continues to increase 
as a result  we expect business category revenue to range between and million in net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our consumer lines for increased by to million  from million in retail sales outside north america and europe increased by million compared to due to a new distributor in australia and strong sales in argentina  brazil and new zealand 
the increase in consumer lines net sales was also driven by the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately million 
however  excluding the positive foreign exchange impact  the dollar amount of european retail sales was constant  compared to the prior year 
this increase in consumer lines net sales was also driven by our entry into the custom electronic design installation association cedia market in the second quarter of  as cedia sales increased by million from partially offsetting these increases was private label sales  which decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this was due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales in the united states

we expect consumer category revenue to range between and million in gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to subscription broadcast sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate as compared to our other sales  representing a larger percentage of our total business 
the impact of this change in mix was a reduction in the gross profit rate 
partially offsetting this decrease in the gross profit rate was a reduction of million of freight expense recorded in as compared to in  there was a decrease in the percentage of units that were shipped by air 
lower freight expense contributed to a increase in the gross profit rate 
a reduction in inventory scrap expense of million added to the gross profit rate 
scrap expense has declined as inventory management has improved 
royalty expense increased thousand  but added to the gross profit rate 
royalty expense is tied to consumer sales  which have declined as a percentage of our total business 
warranty expense decreased by million  which added to the profit rate 
gross profit was also favorably impacted by the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in gross profit of approximately million and an increase of in the gross profit rate 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the expensing of stock options  which was adopted on january  sfas r  accounted for million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is related to development efforts with radio frequency technology using the z wave platform  continued expansion of the nevo platform and development efforts taking place at our san mateo location 
we expect research and development expenses to remain near current levels for the full year selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in employee performance based bonuses increased by million  payroll and benefits increased by million due to the growth of our company  expensing of stock options  which was adopted on january  sfas r  amounted to million  travel increased million  delivery and freight costs increased by million due to the increase in sales volume  advertising increased by million  million is attributable to tradeshows and million due to the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar 
these items were partially offset by lower bad debt expense  which decreased by million 
fiscal bad debt expense included a million write down for a receivable due from a former european distributor 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will range between and million for the full year

royalty revenue revenue earned through licensing of intellectual property recognized in attributable to agreements signed in the fourth quarter of of million and the acquisition of simpledevices also contributed to the increase in net sales 
the acquisition of simpledevices added net sales of million and to the business category net sales growth 
net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were approximately of net sales for compared to for net sales in our consumer lines for decreased by to million  from million in the decrease in sales resulted primarily from a decrease in european retail sales  which were down to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes in the uk market and the weakening of both the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar 
the impact of the weakening currencies resulted in a decrease in net sales of approximately million 
excluding the negative foreign exchange impact  european retail sales decreased million compared to private label sales decreased by to million in from million in this was due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
kameleon sales declined during compared to as a result of fewer new product introductions 
united states direct import licensing and product revenues for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
partially offsetting these decreases was our entry into the cedia market  in the second quarter of this added net sales of million and to the consumer category net sales growth as compared to 
table of contents gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to subscription broadcast sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate as compared to our other sales  representing a larger percentage of our total business 
the impact of this change in mix was a reduction in the gross profit rate 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by an additional million of freight expense recorded in as compared to a portion of this increase in freight relates to sales volume  however  the majority of the increase is due to a change in rate 
in  there was an increase in the percentage of units that were shipped by air versus ocean as well as a mix shift towards subscription broadcast sales 
freight contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
duties increased million  as a larger percentage of units were imported 
the increase in duty expense contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by the weakening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately million and a reduction of in the gross profit rate 
all other product costs  which include warranty expense  quality assurance expense  and component costs  increased million and reduced the gross profit rate by 
partially offsetting these decreases in the gross profit rate was a reduction in inventory scrap expense of million 
this reduction added to the gross profit rate 
in addition  royalty expense declined million due to the decline in the volume of kameleon sales  which added to the gross profit rate 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is related to our continued expansion of the nevo platform and development efforts taking place at simpledevices 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in the development of audio video accessories for sale in our retail channel 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to the acquisition of simpledevices  million to payroll and benefits  million to bad debt expense  which included a million reserve for a receivable due from a former european distributor  million to delivery and freight costs caused by the increase in volume  million to increased tax and audit fees  million to sales commissions  million to travel  million to trade shows  million to temporary clerical and warehouse staff  and million to all other selling  general  and administrative costs

the increase in cash flows from operations in compared to is primarily due to an increase in net sales  which resulted in an increase in net income of from million in to million in  as well as improvement in our days sales outstanding and overall inventory management 
our days sales outstanding improved from approximately days at december  to approximately days at december   due primarily to strong collections from our significant customers 
in addition  despite an increase in net sales of approximately from to  inventory levels remained relatively constant with the prior year

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of these risks and the use of financial instruments to mitigate our risk exposure 
on august   we amended our credit facility to extend for an additional three years  expiring on august  the interest payable under our revolving credit facility with our bank is variable and based on either i the bank s cost of funds or ii the libor rate plus a fixed margin of  the rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   we had no borrowings on our credit facility 
the interest rate in effect on the credit facility as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
at december  we had wholly owned subsidiaries in the netherlands  united kingdom  germany  france  argentina  spain and italy 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in local currencies including euros  british pounds and argentine pesos  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and  in some cases  to each other  may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and net income 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates that affect cash flows and our reported income 
contract terms for the foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than nine months 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the value of our net balance sheet positions held in foreign currency can also be impacted by fluctuating exchange rates  as can the value of the income generated by our european subsidiaries 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income  as it depends on the opening and closing rates  the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency and the amount of income generated in local currency 
we routinely forecast what these balance sheet positions and income generated in local currency may be  and we take steps to minimize exposure as we deem appropriate 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to the variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we believe that movements in foreign currency rates could have a material affect on our financial position 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   net income and cash flows in the first quarter of would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively
