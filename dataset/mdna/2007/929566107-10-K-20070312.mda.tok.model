item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to reposition wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our new credit facility  and contractual commitments 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
as part of our commitment to expand our customer base and grow our market leadership  we acquired transcraft corporation on march  transcraft s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements in the manufacturing segment from the date of acquisition 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through its retail branch network 
executive summary the year was mixed with both success and challenge for us 
we faced continued upward pressure from raw materials commodity prices  had a difficult launch of our new automated manufacturing line and faced disruptions related to our new enterprise resource planning erp system 
we have made significant progress throughout the year in overcoming most of these challenges 
in addition  we successfully completed the acquisition of transcraft corporation 
as we move forward  we expect the overall trailer market for to decline from and then recover in we continue to focus on the improvement of our manufacturing and retail operations  expanding our customer base  introducing products that meet customers needs  exiting non core operations and strengthening our capital structure 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective of being better today than yesterday  and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we have made improvements to our total recordable incident rate resulting in a reduction in our workers compensation costs in compared to we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield py 
py is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
in  py was adversely impacted with the implementation of our erp system  however  post implementation improvements enabled us to exceed previous year s levels 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
we utilize this information  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts  we have seen decreasing rates of warranty payments over the last three years 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our inventory turns  which is a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency  to approximately and turns per year in and  respectively  compared to approximately six turns in cost reduction 
during  we introduced our continuous improvement ci initiative 
since introduction  over ci events have been completed with executed in the scope in focused on the new erp system  improved supply chain performance  improving alpha line production levels  and continuing branch ci activity 
we rolled out ci training to additional key support associates to capture increased savings in  further embedding the continuous improvement culture into everything we do 
we also continue to refine our systems to ensure the processes we create are sustained going forward 
industry trends freight transportation in the united states  according to the american trucking association ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in the latest such information available 
ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment  accounting for approximately of freight industry revenue in the united states 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
information is obtained from sources such as act  ata  cass logistics and eno transportation foundation 
recent trends we have observed include the following improvement in the number of units shipped 
after reaching a high of approximately  units shipped in  shipments by the us trailer industry declined to approximately  units in unit shipments rebounded to approximately    and  in   and  respectively 
act estimates shipments will be approximately  in and  in our view is that shipments will be approximately to lower than the current act forecast due to a slower economic and freight demand environment and the impact of raw material costs on trailer prices 
increasing age of truckload motor carrier trailer fleets 
during the three year period ending december  the latest such information available  the average age of trailer fleets increased from approximately months to months 
we believe this increase resulted in part from deferred purchases by many motor carriers 
this trend suggests to us that there may be pent up replacement demand for trailers 
stable rate of new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placement rates remain stable  achieving per month ranges of  to  in  and  to  in total trailer orders in were  units  a increase from  units ordered in other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include new us federal truck emission regulations took effect in january   resulting in cleaner  yet less fuel efficient and more costly tractor engines 
as a consequence  many trucking firms accelerated purchases of tractors prior to the effective date of the regulation  significantly reducing the historical trailer to tractor ratio of to  to to during  according to act 
while we foresee the trailer to tractor ratio continuing at slightly better than this level in  we believe the ratio is unlikely to return to prior historic norms 
technology advances in trailer tracking and route management implemented by motor carriers  which have led to increased trailer utilization and lowered trailer to tractor ratios  could result in reduced trailer demand 
truck driver shortages experienced over the past several years have constrained freight market capacity growth in large part due to the difficulty in hiring and retaining drivers 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to grow and we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit general and administrative expenses selling expenses impairment of goodwill income from operations interest expense foreign exchange gains and losses  net loss on debt extinguishment other  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income compared to net sales net sales in were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows in millions  except unit data year ended december  change sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailers units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailers manufacturing segment sales in were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of million in sales  or approximately  units  from transcraft since the date of acquisition and increased average selling prices for van trailers as van unit volumes were flat 
the average selling prices for van trailers increased approximately from due to our ability to pass along a portion of the increases in material costs and changes in product mix as more higher priced refrigerated units and fewer lower priced convertible dollies and containers were sold compared to the prior year 
retail and distribution segment sales were million in  a decrease million  or  compared to new trailer sales in this segment decreased million and sales for parts and service declined million in primarily as a result of fewer retail outlets in operation during used trailer sales were comparable with the prior year although selling prices were less favorable in due to product mix 

gross profit gross profit in was million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in as discussed below  both of our segments were impacted as follows in millions year ended december  change gross profit by segment manufacturing retail and distribution intercompany profit eliminations total gross profit manufacturing segment gross profit in decreased million or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales was largely due to the impact of higher raw material costs  primarily steel and aluminum 
these were offset by gross profit contributions from transcraft of million since the date of acquisition 
additionally  the decrease was driven by manufacturing inefficiencies that arose in the second and third quarters of related to parts shortages and issues with inbound logistics that had a detrimental impact on scheduling and production 
these inefficiencies were primarily the result of issues arising from the implementation of our new erp system 
retail and distribution segment gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or compared to this was a result of lower sales primarily driven by fewer retail outlets in as compared with the retail and distribution segment s gross profit as a percent of sales was in  compared to in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was largely due to the inclusion of million from transcraft since the date of acquisition  including million of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired 
outside professional fees related to erp implementation of million  higher stock based compensation costs of million  primarily the result of adoption of sfas no 
r  and million of additional amortization of our new erp system  also contributed to the increase 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in employee compensation 
impairment of goodwill as part of the preparation of our financial statements  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that the goodwill within the retail and distribution reporting unit was impaired 
we determined that the book value of the reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit as determined using the present value of expected future cash flows on the assessment date 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill of million was impaired 
the goodwill impairment was the result of the revised outlook as determined by our budgeting process for future periods 
future periods are being impacted by recent changes in the pattern of used trailer grade activity by larger fleet operators resulting in longer trade cycles and increased levels of direct sales of used trailers by customers 
these changes impact both the profitability of used trailer and the parts and services operations 
also impacting future periods is the continued reduction of our retail locations 
other income expense interest expense increased million  or  in to million due to increased average borrowings during the year as our cost of borrowing remained relatively flat 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to a tax benefit of million in the effective rate for was 
this rate includes recognition of the reversal of valuation allowance and reserves primarily resulting from the settlement of certain state income tax positions totaling million 
we also recognized million of valuation allowance against foreign losses incurred during the year 
as of december   we had approximately million of remaining us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which will expire in if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations on use under internal revenue service rules 
in  we determined that a portion of our previously reserved deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on criteria set forth in sfas no 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowance previously recorded and  additionally  we utilized million of net operating losses nol to offset income 
compared to net sales net sales in increased million compared to the period 
by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows in millions  except unit data year ended december  change sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailers units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailers manufacturing segment sales increased due to higher unit volumes and prices  which were offset  in part  by a change in product mix resulting from an increased percentage of lower priced double  container and converter dolly units in as compared to the increase in sales prices resulted from our ability to pass through most increases in raw material costs 
the volume increase was driven by increases in the overall van industry  as well as our increased market share  penetration into the mid market and ability to add customers 
sales for in the retail and distribution segment were up million compared to the prior year 
new trailer sales in this segment increased million primarily as a result of higher selling prices  which outpaced the impact of a decline in unit volume 
an increase in used trailer sales of million was achieved despite inventory constraints through the first three quarters of  as selling prices were positively impacted by market conditions and product mix 
sales for parts and service declined million compared to the period  due to having seven fewer full service branches during part or all of leasing revenues declined million in from  as we continue to wind down that business 
gross profit gross profit in increased million to million compared to million in gross profit as a percent of sales was compared to in as discussed below  both of our segments were impacted as follows in millions year ended december  change gross profit by segment manufacturing retail and distribution intercompany profit eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit in was positively impacted by an increase in unit volume over and our ability to raise prices to offset increases in average per trailer raw material costs  including the effects of product mix 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  a percentage point decrease from the decrease in margin percentage was impacted by product mix including a larger percentage of lower margin units being sold in as compared to  manufacturing inefficiencies that arose towards the end of the second quarter related to the utilization of personnel  parts shortages and an increased focus on product quality  and start up inefficiencies in the production of a new container product resulted in higher material  labor and overhead costs per unit 
further  gross profit in was negatively impacted by higher warranty expense of million due in large part to additional provisions for trailers produced prior to we also incurred additional trailer delivery costs of million in compared to the period benefited from the favorable outcome of residual contingencies of million 
the retail and distribution segment attained improved gross profit in through favorable market conditions and internal initiatives 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit as a percent of sales increased to in from in parts and service margins as a percent of sales were up in compared to due to favorable parts pricing policy changes and service productivity gains from ci initiatives 
used trailer margins were up in due to the overall strength of the used trailer market 
new trailer margins declined slightly in as selling price increases were unable to fully offset material cost increases 
the period includes million of profit related to roadrailer bogies from our finance and leasing business and million of expense related to software that become fully amortized in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in from million in primarily due to reductions in outside professional fees and compensation costs 
the period included a recovery of taxes of million 
other income expense interest expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from primarily due to reduced borrowings 
loss on debt extinguishment in of million represents the write off of deferred debt costs associated with the pay off of our bank term loan with proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
other  net in was income of million compared to income of million in the income in was primarily related to gains on the sale of properties 
income taxes in  we analyzed our projected future income and determined that a portion of our previously reserved deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on criteria set forth in sfas no 
as a result  we have reversed million of valuation allowance previously recorded 
in addition  we utilized million of net operating losses nol to offset current year income 
we recognized income tax expense of million in the period primarily related to federal and state alternative minimum tax amt 
we also have a us federal tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire beginning in  if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations under irs rules 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure today  our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio is approximately our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities  pay dividends and fund potential stock repurchases

the revolving facility also contains additional customary affirmative covenants and events of default  including among other events  certain cross defaults  business disruption  condemnation and change in ownership 
previous amendments 
prior to entering into the revolving facility on february   we and our lenders entered into a consent and amendment of the prior facility 
the consent allowed the completion of the transcraft acquisition 
additionally  the definition of ebitda was amended to exclude expenses relating to stock options and restricted stock grants  which are additional add backs to ebitda 
on september   we and our lenders also entered into an amendment of the prior facility to  among other things  allow dividend payments up to million per fiscal year and allow the repurchase of up to million of common stock over the remaining term of the agreement 
under the repurchase program  adopted by our board of directors on september   we could repurchase up to two million shares of our common stock on the open market or in private transactions  at times and amounts deemed appropriate 
on august   our board of directors approved an amendment to our repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to million without limitation on the number of shares 
we may limit or terminate the program at any time 
during and  we repurchased  and  shares at a cost of million and million  respectively 
the total amount purchased under the program as of december  was  shares at a cost of million 
in and  we declared dividends of million and million  respectively 
cash flow operating activities provided million in cash in compared to million in working capital utilized million of cash in compared to million in the use by working capital in was more than offset by net income adjusted for non cash items of million in as outlined below accounts receivables decreased million during compared to an increase of million in  due to lower van sales in december compared to driven by the timing of customer shipments 
days sales outstanding dso  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  was approximately days in compared to days in inventory increased million during compared to an increase of million in the increase is due primarily to higher new trailer inventories  increased raw materials inventory related primarily to tires as we procured stock in advance of requirements to ensure availability of product and increased raw material prices for commodities such as steel and aluminum 
inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns  were times in compared to times in investing activities used million during  including million used for the transcraft acquisition and million for capital improvement projects  most notably our erp implementation of million 
financing activities used million during  primarily due to the repurchase of common stock and payment of dividends 
as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  amounted to approximately million and total debt and lease obligations amounted to approximately million  including million of off balance sheet operating leases 
we expect that in  we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements and quarterly dividend payments 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to million for and is anticipated to be in the range of million for outlook according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry sales are expected to be down from to approximately  units in and  units in as mentioned previously  our view is that shipments will be approximately to lower than the current act forecast 
act has further reported that industry order rates continue to be healthy with cancellations remaining lower than expected 
as we look ahead to  we anticipate only a modest decrease in van industry production 
act is estimating that the industry will ship  units in compared to  shipped in we expect to sell approximately  vans in  compared to  in this modest industry decrease reflects the expected slower economic growth in the first half of from a platform trailer standpoint  act is estimating that the industry will ship  units in  compared to  shipped in through transcraft  we expect to sell approximately  platform trailers  compared to  in the decrease in the platform market is attributed to a slower economy and new housing construction market 
overall  act is predicting that the trailer industry will remain healthy through we believe we are in a strong position in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailers maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the mid market carriers 
in  we added approximately new mid market customers accounting for orders of over  new trailers 
since implementing our mid market sales strategy three years ago  we have added over new mid market customers accounting for orders for over  new trailers 
the year will also see us facing pricing headwinds and continued pressure from raw material and component pricing 
as has been our policy  we expect to attempt to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
looking ahead  we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition to increase profitability 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows in millions thereafter total debt excluding interest senior convertible notes bank revolver due total debt other operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total other commercial commitments total obligations residual guarantees represent commitments related to certain new trailer sales transactions prior to where we had entered into agreements to guarantee end of term residual value 
the agreements also contain an option for us to purchase the used equipment at a predetermined price 
we have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments 
we have million in purchase commitments through december for aluminum  which is within normal production requirements 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions balance sheet caption item required approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and other assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required from time to time to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates discount rate deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have a significant impact on our business

the statement was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
for  we maintained an average floating rate borrowing level of million under our revolving line of credit 
based on this average borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to approximately a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates we are subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate that impact intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary  as well as us denominated transactions between the canadian subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
a five cent change in the canadian exchange rate would have an immaterial impact on results of operations 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
