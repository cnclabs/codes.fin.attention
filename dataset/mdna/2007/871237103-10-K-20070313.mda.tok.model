table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
on august   the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock 
a total of million shares have been repurchased under this program since inception 
the shares are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions

this million net change in assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million increase in receivables  a million increase in other assets partially offset by a million increase in taxes payable  a million increase in deferred revenue  and a million increase in other liabilities 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
during  approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
an available source of future cash flows from financing activities is from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which amount is subject to certain borrowing limitations 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  the amount of million may be increased up to a maximum of million with the prior written consent of the lenders

the credit facility prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness  subject to certain specific exclusions 
there were no borrowings in and and no outstanding balances as of december  and with million availability under the credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit facility 

table of contents at december   we had million in cash  of which approximately million was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future and stock repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition and the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab  as amended  and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provide guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
eitf provides further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
we recognize revenue from services as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenue for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
up front fees received in connection with certain constracts are deferred and recognized over the service period of the respective contracts 
royalty revenue is recognized when a contract has been fully executed  the product has been delivered or provided  the license fees or rights are fixed and determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no other contingencies 
revisions to these estimates  which could result in adjustments to fixed price contracts and estimated losses  are recorded in the period when such adjustments or losses are known or can be reasonably estimated 
product sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
we recognize revenue from licenses of our software products and rights when the agreement has been executed  the product or right has been delivered or provided  collectibility is probable and the software license fees or rights are fixed and determinable 
if any portion of the license fees or rights is subject to forfeiture  refund or other contractual contingencies  we defer revenue recognition until these contingencies have been resolved 
revenue from support and maintenance activities is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents revenue from contracts with multiple deliverables to include hardware  software  consulting and other services  or related contracts with the same client  are allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if the deliverables in the contract s meet the criteria for such treatment 
such criteria include whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item  whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control 
fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis  which generally consists of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service  the contract s is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenue between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
in some cases  revenue may be recognized over the contract period in proportion to the level of service provided on a systematic and rational basis  using the proportional performance method 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would reduce income from operations 
we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
at december   management determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
we have a contingent income tax liability of million consisting of amounts for subsidiaries located in both the americas and emea segments that is accounted for in income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of the contingent liability is based on an estimate of the probable liability in accordance with sfas no 
sfas accounting for contingencies  using available evidence  including detailed analyses of the potential income tax issues  income tax assessments and notices of disallowance  consultation with independent outside tax and legal advisors and our historical experience in settling similar issues without additional income tax liability 
changes in our assumptions  estimates and judgments could impact our estimate of the probable contingent income tax liability  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles  property and equipment  and investment in shps  incorporated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
periodically  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in foreign currency 
the principal foreign currency hedged has been the euro using foreign currency contracts ranging in periods from one to three months 
however  due to the strengthening philippine peso against the us dollar  in february the company entered into a foreign currency contract to purchase philippine pesos at a fixed price of million to settle on march  foreign currency contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis  with realized and unrealized gains or losses recognized in the current period  as we have not historically designated our foreign currency contracts as accounting hedges 
unrealized and realized gains or losses related to these contracts for the three years ended december  were immaterial 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended december   a one point increase in the weighted average interest rate  which generally equals the libor rate plus an applicable margin  would not have had a material impact on our annual interest expense 
at december   we had no debt outstanding at variable interest rates 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
