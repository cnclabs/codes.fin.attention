critical accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
certain accounting estimates  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
customer sales and discounts and allowances the company gives allowances and offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers that are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
the company records estimated reductions to sales for price promotion discounts at the time the product purchased by the independent sales distributor is sold to the customer distributor discounts at the time revenue is recognized coupon expense at the estimated redemption rate customer rebates at the time revenue is recognized cooperative advertising at the time the company s obligation to the customer is incurred product returns received from independent sales distributors price promotion discount expense is recorded when the related product being discounted is sold by the independent sales distributor to the customer 
the amount of the price promotion is captured when the independent sales distributor sells product to the customer 
the price promotion discount is based upon actual discounts per case based upon an approved price promotion calendar 
any increase or decrease in volume may result in variations to price discounts recorded each month 
independent sales distributors receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to customers  adjusted for price promotions and product returns 
direct customers receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product received 
discounts to distributors and customers are based on agreed upon rates  and amounts vary based upon volume 
coupon expense estimates are based upon the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage 
the estimated redemption percentages are based on data obtained from the company s third party coupon processor  and its experience with similar coupon drops 
upon monthly receipt of the actual coupon redemption report  the coupon expense is updated based upon actual coupon activity as well as changes in the forecasted redemption percentage as estimated by the third party coupon processor 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the required quantities to qualify for payment 
if the customers fall above or below the estimate as the year progresses  this could impact the estimate 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded based on the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program 
product returns are recorded as product is returned to the company 
at quarter end  an estimated reserve for product returns is recorded based upon sales and actual return experience in the last month of the quarter 
actual returns may vary from this estimate 
a product return reserve is established based on the actual product returns that come in subsequent to year end 
some customers take unauthorized deductions when they make payments to the company 
unauthorized deductions are taken by customers for various reasons  including  but not limited to missing or damaged product 
it is the company s policy to establish a reserve for each unauthorized deduction at the time it is taken by the customer 
the reserve is maintained until such time as the company can determine the validity of the deduction 
if it is ultimately determined after investigation that a deduction is not valid  the customer is charged back and the reserve is reversed 
since the company obtains updated information on every discount and allowance account each month  the risk that estimates are not properly recorded is generally limited to a percentage of one month s activity 
the average monthly amount of discounts and allowances was approximately million in historically  actual discounts and allowances have not varied significantly from estimates 
total discounts and allowances were of gross sales in this percentage is consistent with prior years and is a significant percentage of gross sales since all price discounts given to both independent sales distributors and third party distributors are reflected as reductions to gross sales 
provision for doubtful accounts the company aggressively pursues collection of accounts receivable balances 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition and makes quarterly estimates of its ability to collect its accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable trends and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  levels of customer deductions  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has three components 
the first component is a reserve against all accounts receivable balances based on the last five years of write off experience for the company 
the second component is for specific trade customer accounts receivable balances from customers whose ability to pay is in question  such as customers who file for bankruptcy while they have an outstanding balance due the company 
the third component is a reserve against any breached independent sales distributor accounts receivable balances that are not adequately covered by the independent sales distributor s equity in the route territory 
although the total allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated risk for all customer balances  if any one of our top twenty customers accounts receivable balances became fully uncollectible  it would have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and would negatively impact cash flow 
long lived asset impairment in accordance with sfas no  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in instances where the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the review for potential impairment utilizes estimates and assumptions of future cash flows directly related to the asset 
cash flow estimates are typically derived from the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
for assets where there is no plan for future use  the review for impairment includes estimates and assumptions of the fair market value of the asset  which is based on the best information available 
the company uses market prices  when available  and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their book value or market value 
adverse changes in future market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of an affected asset 
pension and postretirement plans accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  and mortality and employee turnover 
a sensitivity analysis for pensions is included in note and a sensitivity analysis for postretirement benefits other than pensions is included in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
licensed independent actuaries perform these required calculations to determine liability and expense in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in addition  the company may experience significant changes in its pension expense from year to year because of its election in to immediately recognize all pension gains and losses in excess of its pension corridor in the year that they occur 
for comparative purposes  this is relevant because most other public companies use an amortization method that allows recognition of pension gains and losses to be amortized over longer periods of time  up to years 
also  the final determination of the gains and losses that could potentially exceed the corridor is not known until the last day of the year  which makes it difficult to estimate 
the combination of low interest rates and low or negative rates of return on plan assets can cause higher levels of pension expense  conversely  high interest rates and high rates of return on assets could result in higher levels of pension income 
market conditions where interest rates and asset returns move inversely relative to each other  in most instances  cause the company to have pension expense or income within its allowable pension corridor 
actual results may differ from the company s assumptions and may impact the reported liability and expense amounts reported for pensions and postretirement benefits 
during long term corporate bond rates increased and overall pension asset returns were above the assumption 
in addition  the discount rate increased from at the end of to at the end of there were no gains or losses in excess of the pension corridor for or in the fourth quarter  the company recorded additional pension expense in the amount of in excess of the pension corridor 
with the implementation of medicare part d in january  the company no longer provides medical benefits for most of its post retirees 
in addition  incumbent retirees pay age based rates for life insurance benefits in excess of as a result of these benefit changes  the projected benefit obligation was remeasured and the company recognized a reduction in its other post retirement benefits opeb liability of approximately  which will be amortized over future periods 
in  the company recognized the amortization of this liability in a reduction of pre tax opeb expense of  this is primarily a non cash benefit 
workers compensation expense accounting for workers compensation expense requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including the ultimate severity of injuries  the timeliness of reporting injuries  and health care cost increases 
the company insures for workers compensation liabilities under a large deductible program where losses are incurred by the company up to certain specific and aggregate amounts 
accruals for claims under the large deductible insurance program are recorded as claims are incurred 
the company estimates the liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims  adjusted by loss development factors which account for the development of losses over time 
loss development factors are based on prior loss experience and on the age of incurred claims  and are reviewed by a third party claim loss specialist 
the company s estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years  adjusted for the limits on the aggregate amounts and discounted to present value 
the company evaluates the estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjusts it accordingly 
included in the estimate of liability is an estimate for expected changes in inflation and health care costs 
if there were to be an excessive number of workers compensation claims in a given accounting period and these actual results varied from the company s assumptions  these could have a material impact on our cash flow and consolidated statement of operations 
income tax valuation during the year  the company records income tax expense and liabilities based on estimates of book and tax income  and current tax rates 
these estimates could vary in the future due to uncertainties in company profits  new laws  new interpretations of existing laws  and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of federal and state income tax loss carryforwards nols 
these carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  the amount realized could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are not achieved 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of unused state tax credits which expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the state credits 
a valuation allowance in the amount of has been established as management believes that a portion of the state credits may not be realized

 accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fas fin  which clarifies the criteria for recognition and measurement of benefits from uncertain tax positions 
under fin  an entity should recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
the amount to be recognized should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
furthermore  any change in the recognition  derecognition or measurement of a tax position should be recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
on september   the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab  effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  in sab  the sec staff establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it essentially requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
from a transition perspective  sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the adoption of sab had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on september   the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles

   and r fas 
fas changes balance sheet accounting and requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets a liability and or an asset equal to the under funded or over funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
it is effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after december  the company s adoption date for fas is its fiscal year end  december the funded status that the company will report on its balance sheet under fas is to be measured as the difference between the fair market value of plan assets and the benefit obligation on a plan by plan basis 
for the company s defined benefit pension plan db plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation pbo 
for the opeb plans  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
the company s defined benefit plans include an under funded db plan  unfunded defined benefit serp plan db serp  and an unfunded db directors retirement plan 
additionally  the company has an unfunded opeb plan 
fas requires that previously disclosed but unrecognized gains losses  prior service costs credits  and transition assets obligations be recognized at adoption as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of applicable income taxes 
previously  these amounts were disclosed in the notes to the company s financial statements 
fas also requires that for each under funded plan  an amount equal to the next months expected benefit payments in excess of the plan s current assets be classified as current liability 
the remainder is to be classified as non current liability 
the required transition method of adoption for fas is prospective 
prior period statements will not be restated 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on the company s balance sheet for the defined benefit plans since it had recognized an additional minimum liability in in conjunction with the db plan 
the balance sheet is impacted by the adoption of fas for its opeb liability 
upon the adoption of fas  the company recognized an immediate reduction in its opeb liability of  with a corresponding increase in aoci of  net of tax effects of in february  the fasb issues statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value  and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the extent to which its current practices  financial statements and disclosures may change as a result of the adoption of fas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company has certain floating rate debt notes 
the company has hedged a portion of this risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts which fixed the interest rate for the term of the debt 
under current market conditions  the company believes that changes in interest rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
it is expected that a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the unhedged portion would result in additional annual expense of approximately the company also has notes receivable from sales distributors whose rates adjust every three years  and  therefore  these would partially offset the fluctuations in the company s interest rates on its notes payable 
the company also has the right to sell these notes receivable  and could use these proceeds to liquidate a corresponding amount of the debt on the notes payable 
information on the debt  including the interest rate swaps and notes receivable  can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements  notes and  respectively
