item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  the subscribenet service also has broad application beyond the software industry  including the delivery and entitlement management of digital goods such as video  music  and content 
accordingly  we are expanding our efforts to reach these new markets 
the primary features of the subscribenet service are software manager license manager channel manager evaluation manager commerce manager each of these features is described briefly below 
software manager subscribenet software manager is the service through which software companies can deliver software files in digital form  instead of manufacturing and shipping cds 
the software manager service enables software companies to easily deliver  track and manage the software they distribute to global customers  helps them manage complex entitlements  and strengthens their compliance controls 
for example  software manager allows software companies to ensure that software updates and upgrades are distributed only to end users who are entitled to receive them 
in addition  software manager automatically screens digital software deliveries for export compliance and provides independent third party evidence that software has been delivered for purposes of revenue recognition 
license manager the subscribenet license manager service allows customers to automatically generate and manage license keys for their products  which eliminates the need for manual license key generation 
because license keys are generated and tracked automatically  new purchasers of digital goods such as software applications can immediately obtain license keys for those products and begin using them without manual intervention by customer support operations 
similarly  existing customers can have continuous access to the digital goods they have purchased through a secure online platform 
license manager also enables customers to establish automatic expiration dates for license keys and ensures that license entitlements do not extend beyond those dates  again without the need for manual intervention 
additionally  the license manager feature allows customers to capture usage data to help them determine which products  platforms  and languages need future upgrades 
channel manager the channel manager feature of subscribenet helps customers manage delivery and licensing strategies for their sales channels  and helps reduce the cost of delivering software and licenses through channel sales 
using channel manager  our customers can specify product availability  and can set rules for order management  branding  and degree of end user activity visibility  for sales channels 
channel partners  in turn  are provided immediate access to products  licenses  and other self management tools that let them manage licensing  order processing  and delivery as appropriate 
the channel manager service also gives channel partners greater insight into end user activities  preferences  and renewal schedules 
evaluation manager subscribenet evaluation manager allows our customers to give their sales prospects immediate online access to trial versions of their software applications 
it also helps customers capture important information about their sales prospects and integrates that data into their customer relationship management crm software  such as salesforce 
com and oracle 
among its other features  the evaluation manager service can track and report all registrations and downloads during marketing campaigns and establish pre qualification rules to determine when downloads of trial software should be permitted 
commerce manager we have entered into a strategic relationship with digital river to deliver an integrated solution for managing the online sale  distribution  licensing  and renewal of software products and licenses 
digital river builds and manages online commerce systems for software publishers  manufacturers  distributors and online retailers 
our strategic relationship with digital river is intended to provide our customers a comprehensive method of selling  distributing and managing their digital content online  whether they are selling software applications or other digital files  such as video files 
demand for our service we believe demand for our services is driven by a number of factors  including cost savings through digital delivery 
through electronic delivery  distributors of digital content can significantly reduce manufacturing and distribution costs associated with creating  packaging  duplicating and shipping cds  dvd s  and diskettes 
entitlement management 
using our subscribenet technology  owners of digital content can set and manage the entitlements of those to whom they download files or content  thereby protecting their valuable digital assets 
entitlement controls and licensing for software providers 
our service enables software providers and end users to manage software entitlements and electronically generate and deliver licenses  helping software providers maximize revenues and helping customers quickly and easily ensure license compliance in dynamic environments 
customer satisfaction 
our service enables end users to receive software and licenses within minutes after purchase or release 
we also provide an online library of an end user s software entitlements  as well as tools for it departments to monitor and control licensing and downloads of that software throughout their organizations 
business intelligence 
our solution can generate reports to help software providers understand end users use of and experience with the software providers products  including reports that help identify key individual end users  track the download frequency of different releases  and track the speed and quality of downloads 
accelerated delivery 
accelerated delivery of bug fixes and patches can shorten resolution times for software errors  viruses and security flaws affecting end users 
real time online fulfillment of software sales may also accelerate revenue recognition for software providers 
regulatory compliance 
by automatically providing third party confirmation of software availability  our service can help software finance departments document compliance with delivery requirements under software revenue recognition rules 
we also screen software downloads for compliance with us export controls 
tax savings by end users 
a number of states exempt software license purchases from sales tax if the software is delivered electronically  providing a competitive advantage to software providers that are able to effect such delivery 
strategic advantages among competitive offerings  or compared to solutions developed in house by software providers  the subscribenet service offers strategic advantages  including integrated software and license delivery and management 
the subscribenet service offers a single integrated solution for delivery and management of full catalogs of enterprise software and electronic licenses 
software providers can electronically fulfill orders  manage update processes  and generate  assign and deliver licenses through a single web interface 
entitlement management 
technology companies and other distributors of digital content can manage relationships among the products in their catalogs  the various releases of those products  and the files that comprise each such release 
they also can assign entitlements for any combination of those items to their customers and individual end users 
entitlements can be assigned in the subscribenet service through our extended license generation solution  or directly from the customer s order processing  crm  e commerce or licensing system  and can be time limited to match the duration of customer maintenance contracts 
technology infrastructure 
the technology infrastructure underlying the subscribenet service is engineered to provide scalability  redundancy  platform independence and x service 
integration with back office systems 
the subscribenet service integrates with major enterprise resource planning erp  processing  and crm systems used by customers 
reporting 
the subscribenet service provides extensive reporting capabilities to support software providers internal transaction reporting requirements and to help them analyze end user usage trends 
regulatory compliance 
the subscribenet service provides automated screening and reporting to support compliance with us export regulations  and provides third party evidence of software availability to support compliance with software revenue recognition rules 
rapid implementation 
once a customer s particular requirements are defined and its resources are allocated  our implementation methodology enables standard subscribenet implementations to be completed quickly 
channel management 
our channel manager module enables technology companies to extend some or all of the benefits of the subscribenet service to their resellers and their resellers end users  while keeping confidential data segregated among the software provider and its various resellers 
focus and expertise 
for the past years  intraware has focused on creating solutions for the enterprise software marketplace 
this focus has enabled us to develop domain expertise and technology for electronic delivery and management of digital goods and license keys  which we believe differentiates us from our competitors 
customers as of april   various software providers subscribed to the subscribenet service 
these include companies whose main business is providing software  companies that distribute software as a secondary business  and companies that resell software 
eight of those customers each accounted for or more of our online services and technology revenue during our fiscal year 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue during our fiscal year see risk factors in item a  and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
digital fastball service our digital fastball service is an electronic content delivery and management service designed for small and medium sized business professionals including creative professionals  such as artists  photographers  musicians  video producers  and publishers services firms  such as consultants  architects  engineers  attorneys  and graphics designers digital fastball uses our network to provide users a fast and secure means of controlling ongoing access of their valuable digital content to a specified list of recipients across the globe 
the underlying technology and infrastructure is based upon our subscribenet technology  which our customers use for electronic software delivery and management 
digital fastball was launched in our fiscal year ended february  we currently are offering digital fastball as a free service to establish a user community and generate word of mouth marketing 
our longer term plans for digital fastball are addressed in more detail in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
sales direct sales of subscribenet we typically sell the subscribenet service on a subscription basis  charging a service fee for a fixed period of time 
the service fee may be fixed up to a specified usage level  variable based  or a combination of both 
we also sell professional services for our customization or implementation of the subscribenet service 
we sell our subscribenet service primarily through a direct sales force dedicated to our subscribenet business 
we have established direct sales offices for our subscribenet sales at our headquarters in orinda  california  and in boston  massachusetts 
each subscribenet sales representative has a territory that he or she covers through telecommunications and in person sales calls 
the sales cycle for these services is typically lengthy because our sales efforts must target the prospective customer s senior personnel across multiple departments 
sales through strategic alliances we maintain a number of strategic alliances intended to complement our direct sales efforts and broaden sales of our subscribenet service 
agreement with digital river 
on june   we entered into a strategic marketing agreement with digital river 
under the terms of the agreement  we are able to work collaboratively with digital river in jointly developing and marketing an integrated service offering that integrates digital river s ecommerce solution with our subscribenet service 
the agreement also allocates revenue between the two companies where our respective services are sold as part of an integrated offering 
in addition  the strategic marketing agreement appoints us as a reseller of various digital river offerings 
the agreement expires on december  unless extended by the parties 
agreement with akamai 
on june   we entered into a reseller agreement with akamai to become a reseller of akamai services in north america 
we also may resell the akamai services outside north america by mutual agreement with akamai 
as part of the agreement  intraware was able to integrate with akamai s global edgeplatform  thereby enabling customers to achieve better cost savings  increased scalability  and performance improvements via higher software download completion rates 
the agreement provides for certain discounts and payments where we act as a reseller of akamai services 
we also receive referral fees from akamai on occasion where we refer customers to akamai but do not act as a reseller 
however  those referral fees are paid under akamai s own referral program and are not a part of our reseller agreement 
our reseller agreement with akamai expires june  unless extended by agreement of the parties 
we currently intend to extend this agreement assuming we can do so on acceptable terms 
agreement with aspera 
we signed a reseller agreement with aspera on december  that agreement allows us to combine aspera s high speed file transfer technology with our core subscribenet service  and also with our digital fastball service 
the reseller agreement provides for certain allocations of fees between us and aspera whenever we sell the aspera service as part of a subscribenet sale 
our reseller agreement with aspera remains in effect indefinitely  although we may terminate the agreement for convenience upon a specified notice period 
preferred rights management partner program 
on october   we introduced our preferred rights management partner program  a vehicle by which digital rights management companies can offer their customers hosted licensing and software delivery services using our subscribenet service 
as members of our program  digital rights management providers receive technical and business development support from us related to the development and sales of products or services that operate in conjunction with our subscribenet service 
our member agreements also provide lead generation fees for customer referrals we provide to them  and for referrals they provide to us 
the current members of our preferred rights management partner program are reprise software  inc  uniloc corporation  and agilis software  llc 
referral arrangements for subscribenet sales 
we also maintain various other referral arrangements under which we pay fees to companies that refer new subscribenet customers to us 
sales outside the united states approximately million of our total revenue for the year ended february   million of our total revenue for the year ended february   and million of our total revenue for the year ended february   was from sales to companies based outside the united states of america  mostly in ireland and other european locations 
all of this revenue was categorized as online services and technology revenue 
these foreign sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue  all of which consisted of online services and technology revenue  for the year ended february   of our total revenue and of our online services and technology revenue for the year ended february   and of our total revenue and of our online services and technology revenue for the year ended february  total annual contract value we track a metric for our subscribenet service business that we call total annual contract value 
we use this metric to approximate what the total ongoing annual subscribenet service fees would be under our existing contracts with our customers  assuming all those contracts renewed on their current terms and  in the case of variable fee contracts  the customers maintained the same level of fee generating activity as they had in the prior twelve months 
however  we cannot guarantee those assumptions will be true  as we describe further below 
we define total annual contract value as  on any given date  the aggregate annual service fees paid or expected to be paid by our customers for services we have contracted to provide during the then current annual periods of the customers respective contracts with us 
to be included in total annual contract value  service fees must be either contractually required to be paid  or expected to be paid based on a minimum month history of prior charges and payments that were not required by contractual minimums 
total annual contract value includes amounts that have been recognized as revenue as well as amounts that may be recognized as revenue in the future 
as of april   the total annual contract value of our subscribenet service customer base was million 
the total annual contract value of our subscribenet service customer base as of april   was million 
we caution that total annual contract value is not necessarily indicative of current revenues or of future revenues in any given fiscal period and should not be relied upon to assess our financial condition 
in addition to the risk factors in item a  factors that could cause differences between total annual contract value and revenues include unexpected contract terminations  reductions in customer activity  the application of our revenue recognition policies described under critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and under revenue recognition in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  and the occurrence of any contingencies that make deferral of revenue recognition appropriate under any given contract 
we also caution that total annual contract value is different from backlog 
backlog typically excludes amounts already recognized as revenue  while total annual contract value may include amounts already recognized as revenue for portions of the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts 
in addition  total annual contract value includes fees that are paid  payable or expected for the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts  even if we expect to provide the related services after our current fiscal year 
professional services we provide implementation and customization consulting related to our subscribenet service 
our professional services team assists the customers in both the design and implementation of our service offering 
our professional services are integral in implementing the service and results in sharing best business practices with our customers 
in addition to implementing our service  our professional services team often works on internal research and development projects to enhance the existing solution 
marketing our central marketing goals are to attract and retain customers for our services 
we target our marketing efforts to senior personnel across multiple departments in software companies and other mid sized and large corporations 
we use an integrated approach of targeted advertising  direct mail  email and online promotions  interactive web based seminars  or webinars  semi annual road show events which involve a physical presence by customers  prospects and intraware members  event sponsorships  trade shows  brand awareness campaigns  and an annual user group conference to stimulate demand for our services  generate sales leads and maintain customer relationships 
we employ a variety of tools to achieve our marketing goals 
our print and online advertising campaigns are designed to target senior personnel across multiple departments in software companies  and educate them on our products and services 
our direct mail  email and online promotions are designed to highlight specific benefits of our services and offer limited time incentives to enter into purchase or evaluation agreements 
in our webinars  our senior executives and other panelists who may include independent it analysts  senior executives of our customers and partners  and other industry experts  educate prospective customers on digital delivery and entitlement management  and other topics relevant to our business 
at our road show events  we rely on a mixture of intraware executives and key customer representatives to reinforce or enhance earlier key messaging 
we also use trade shows  event sponsorships  and regional marketing to target key audiences  expand our customer base and heighten awareness of the intraware brand 
we also hold an annual user conference that provides a forum for industry peers to discuss common challenges  share mutual successes  and learn how others have implemented our solutions 
for intraware  it allows us to educate them on our service offerings  gather feedback from them about our services  and learn about their evolving requirements 
competition the market for electronic delivery and entitlement management is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
our primary competition comes from two sources our potential customers  including software companies and other companies that distribute software or digital goods  who choose to develop an in house alternative to the subscribenet service  and other providers of outsourced electronic software delivery services 
a number of these competitors historically have provided related services  such as e commerce services  replication and distribution of physical media such as cds  or product lifecycle management solutions  but have begun providing electronic software delivery services 
we expect this trend to continue as the demand for digital software delivery increases 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include the performance  features and functionality of electronic delivery and entitlement management solutions  the comprehensiveness of the services offered by providers  such as integration with licensing and physical fulfillment solutions  the cost of a provider s solution versus the cost of competing solutions  or the cost to a potential customer of building  deploying and maintaining an alternative service in house  the provider s experience in and focus on providing services  the provider s track record of successful project implementations  positive references by the provider s existing customers  and the openness of a solution s architecture and the ease with which it integrates with major customer relations management  order processing and enterprise resource planning systems 
we believe we compete effectively as to all of these factors  and that our principal advantages include our relatively senior position as one of the first providers of electronic delivery and entitlement management services  the depth and breadth of features and functionality of our solution  our high capacity  high availability network that enables us to deliver enterprise class software applications rapidly and securely  the broad suite of services that we offer  the price of our solution  particularly compared with the cost to software providers of developing and maintaining an alternative service in house  our strong track record of successful project implementations  existing customers who are willing to provide positive references  the flexibility of our solution  which is easily customized and integrated with customers erp  crm and licensing systems  and our suite of administrative and reporting tools that add value for software companies and their end users 
nevertheless  we face a number of competitive challenges 
a key challenge is resistance from software companies that determine  for perceived strategic reasons or based on their cost assessments  that they do not wish to outsource electronic software delivery or license key generation 
another significant challenge is our focus on electronic delivery and entitlement management services  and our reliance on third party alliances for key ancillary services 
while we believe our focus has enabled us to offer a superior solution  and our integration with strong ancillary solutions addresses a broad set of customer needs  some prospective customers prefer this set of solutions to be supported by a single provider 
a third fundamental challenge is our size relative to that of some of our prospective customers 
some large software providers prefer to outsource services to larger suppliers with greater perceived resources 
in addition  some of our competitors have longer and more profitable operating histories than ours 
they may also have significantly greater financial and other resources  wider name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
they also may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  many of our competitors have existing relationships with divisions of our current or potential customers  and may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing additional services or products from us  or persuade these customers to replace our services or products with their own 
conversely  other competitors are smaller  privately held entities with less day to day financial or operational transparency 
intellectual property  proprietary rights and licenses our future success depends in part on our technology and proprietary rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
although we seek to take advantage of available intellectual property protections  we believe factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  and reliable product maintenance are most essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to ours 
to date  we own three us patents on electronic commerce technologies  expiring in july  september  and february  respectively 
in addition  we have patent applications pending in the united states on our subscribenet technology and one pending for our digital fastball service 
we may file additional patent applications on our subscribenet technology and or digital fastball service during the current fiscal year 
we have trademark registrations in the united states 
our key registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks include intraware  subscribenet  the way digital goods move  and control your technology 
we also hold registrations and pending applications for a number of trademarks and service marks outside the united states 
we are aware that certain other companies are using the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark outside the united states 
while we do not believe we have infringed any rights and we have received no notice of any claims of infringement from any of those companies  and we own registrations for the intraware trademark in the united states and in other countries  we can make no assurance that these or other companies will not claim superior rights to intraware or other marks used in our business 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of our products or services  or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we purchase licenses and will continue to purchase licenses for certain products integral to our services and products  including products which are integrated with our software code and used with our products to provide key functionality 
we cannot be assured that these third party product licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to successfully integrate such third party products into our solutions 
employees as of april   we had employees  including one part time employee 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing intraware 
additional risks and uncertainties presently unknown to us  or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor  may also harm our business operations 
if any of the events  contingencies  circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if that occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we have a history of losses and negative cash flow  and we have yet to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow 
we have incurred significant losses since we were formed in  totaling approximately million  and have yet to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow 
also  with the exception of a few quarters  we have not achieved positive cash flow from operations since our formation in while we had positive cash flows from operations for our fiscal year  we also had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal it is difficult for us to predict when we will be able to achieve sustained profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
the market for our subscribenet electronic software and license delivery and management service is not fully developed and remains volatile 
if the market for our service does not fully develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  our business will be harmed 
the market for on demand digital asset delivery and management services is relatively unproven  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies  large and small  to increase their use of on demand digital delivery services 
if companies do not increase their use of on demand digital asset delivery and management services  our operating results will suffer 
in addition  in this unproven market  we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business 
we market our subscribenet electronic software and license delivery and management service principally to technology companies 
however  many software companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in developing their own electronic software and or license delivery systems  and therefore may be unwilling to migrate to and pay for an outsourced service 
in addition  some software companies have adopted automatic update  or phone home  technology for delivering software updates  whereby an end user s computer automatically contacts the software company s server to check whether updates are available and  if so  downloads and installs those updates 
while subscribenet supports such an approach  this method for delivering software updates could be viewed by our potential and existing customers as an alternative to our digital delivery technology  and therefore any increased adoption of this automatic update technology could hurt our business and results of operations 
further  some companies may be reluctant to use our subscribenet delivery services because they are concerned about the security capabilities of these services 
our efforts to enter new markets could prove unsuccessful 
conversely  we may ill equipped to handle growth rates that could result from entering new markets 
we believe our subscribenet service also has broad application beyond the enterprise technology industry  including the delivery and entitlement management of digital goods such as video  music  and content 
accordingly  we are expanding our efforts to reach these new markets 
one market of particular interest to us is video delivery  including feature length films 
leveraging our core subscribenet technology  we intend to develop a media entertainment offering to help owners of valuable media content deliver their products in digital form  either through distribution channels or directly to consumers 
we also see similar opportunities for the delivery and management of music  game files and various forms of digital media 
however  we have no significant experience selling into or serving these markets  and it is possible our efforts to enter these markets will prove unsuccessful 
similarly  it is possible our efforts to develop our service to meet the needs of these new markets will not succeed 
in either case  we may fail to generate revenue from these efforts  or even recover our marketing and development investments  in which case our business would likely suffer 
by contrast  if we succeed in penetrating new markets  we could face another set of problems 
we are staffed to support the growth rates we foresee in our traditional enterprise software market 
it is possible that if we are effective in reaching new markets  we will be inadequately staffed to service both new and existing customers at the levels we have committed to provide 
it also is possible we will be unable to increase our staffing quickly enough  or manage growth effectively enough  to maintain necessary service levels and or to pursue new opportunities as they arise  in which case our business could suffer 
competition from other electronic delivery and licensing providers  and potential customer development of in house electronic delivery and or licensing systems  could limit our revenue growth and reduce our gross margins 
the market for selling electronic delivery and licensing services is highly competitive 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product and service offerings  better name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
some of our competitors also have well established relationships with our potential customers and with third party information technology or consulting firms that help market our competitors services 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand and improve their service offerings and new competitors enter the market 
in addition  our current and potential customers are primarily information technology companies with strong software development expertise 
when considering their alternatives for implementing a system for electronic delivery of software or license keys  these companies sometimes elect to develop such systems in house 
while we believe our competitive position is strong against both external competitors and in house development  we have at times experienced reduced prices  reduced gross margins and lost sales as a result of such competitive factors 
such competition is likely to intensify  which could limit the growth of our revenues and gross margins 
the loss of one or more of our key customers could cause our revenue growth to slow or cause our revenues to decline 
a substantial portion of the revenues from our subscribenet service comes from a relatively small number of customers 
our contracts with most of these customers are subject to renewal or cancellation annually 
if any of these customers elected to cancel their agreements with us  or are acquired by companies that do not wish to use our services  our revenue growth would likely slow and our revenues could decline 
mergers and acquisitions in the technology sector could harm us by causing cancellation of customer contracts where our customers are acquired  or by strengthening our competitors 
in recent years  there has been an increase in mergers and acquisitions among technology companies 
this trend poses risks for us 
first  our customers are technology companies  and any acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers by the acquiring companies 
second  our competitors also are technology companies 
any acquisitions of other companies by our competitors  or acquisitions of our competitors by other companies  are likely to result in larger and stronger companies competing against us 
either of these types of events could reduce our revenue through loss of existing customers  or reduce our margins through increased price competition 
our current strategy includes the use of strategic marketing relationships  which may prove unsuccessful 
we currently have marketing relationships in place with digital river  inc  hewlett packard  corp  and on demand delivery  inc 
dba nexstra 
we also have a reseller relationship with akamai technologies  inc  under which we resell the akamai service to our subscribenet customers 
however  our relationships with digital river  on demand delivery  and hewlett packard have yet to produce significant revenue  and if they fail to do so in the future  our business could suffer 
similarly  a deterioration or termination of our reseller relationship with akamai could harm our business since a portion or our customer base relies on the akamai service today 
although our subscription based sales model for our subscribenet service limits the volatility of our online services and technology revenue  other factors may cause our operating results  and therefore our stock price  to fluctuate 
our subscribenet service fees  which comprise most of our online services and technology revenues  are recognized ratably over contract terms of generally one year  thereby limiting the quarter to quarter volatility of those revenues 
nevertheless  certain factors may cause our online services and technology revenues to fluctuate 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  factors that could cause such fluctuation include an increasing percentage of our revenues are based upon variable fee provisions in our agreements 
those variable revenues fluctuate based on the degree to which customers are using our service  which is difficult to predict in advance  deferral of subscribenet revenue recognition due to delays by customers in implementing the subscribenet service  due to new sales involving extensive implementations  or due to contract modifications adding significant future deliverables  unexpected increases in customer cancellations  which could result from service deficiencies  or from external conditions or circumstances beyond our control  lengthening of the sales cycle for our subscribenet service due to macroeconomic or other factors  actual events  circumstances  outcomes  and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements or unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  and changes in accounting rules  such as recording expenses for employee stock option grants 
consequently  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict  and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
the technological and functional requirements we must meet to stay competitive are subject to rapid change 
if we are unable to quickly adapt to these changes and meet the demands of our current and potential customers  we will likely lose sales and market share and our revenue growth will be limited 
we market primarily to enterprise technology companies  who generally demand that a service like ours meet high technological and functional standards 
to remain competitive in this market and meet the demands of current and prospective customers  we must continually adapt and upgrade our technology and functionality  including through investments in additional functionality for our subscribenet service and underlying proprietary software 
in addition  we are developing new functionality to reach new markets outside of the enterprise software industry  which are similarly competitive and demanding 
we are a small company with limited resources available for enhancing and expanding our services 
if we do not respond quickly enough to changing industry standards or the increased demands of customers and potential customers  we will likely lose sales and market share to competitors and our growth prospects will be limited 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changing standards and demands 
if we incur such costs and our sales fail to increase commensurately  we may not be able to achieve sustained profitability and positive operating cash flow 
defects in our subscribenet service could diminish demand for the service and subject us to substantial liability 
our service is complex  and may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it  which could harm our reputation and our business 
internet based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite taking precautions to avoid errors  we have found defects in our service from time to time  and we may find new errors in our existing service in the future 
because our customers use our service for important aspects of their business  any errors  defects or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses 
if that occurs  customers could elect not to renew their agreements with us  could be eligible for credits under our service level agreements  and could delay or withhold payment to us 
we also could lose future sales  or customers may make warranty claims against us  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts and revenue reserve  an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  or the expense and risk of litigation 
interruptions or delays in service from our third party web hosting facilities  or in our relationships with third party hardware and software vendors  could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 
we provide our service through computer hardware that is currently located in third party web hosting facilities in santa clara  california operated by savvis communications  and in various locations that are used to support the akamai  inc network 
we do not control the operation of these facilities  and they are subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
while physical security measures are in place  they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
despite precautions taken at the facilities  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision to close a facility without adequate notice  or other unanticipated problems at a facility  could result in lengthy interruptions in our service 
in addition  the failure by either facility to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
any damage to  or failure of  our systems could result in interruptions in our service 
interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue  cause us to issue credits or pay penalties  cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates 
our business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition  to a significant degree  we rely on various third party software applications and hardware to deliver our service 
if we experience disruptions in those vendor relationships and those software and hardware components become unavailable to us  or unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  our service could be interrupted and or damaged  causing harm to our customer relationships  our reputation  and our overall business 
the market for our digital fastball service is unproven 
we continue to develop our digital fastball service to enable small and medium sized businesses  as well as consumers  to send  receive and manage many types and sizes of digital files over the internet quickly  easily and securely 
we currently offer the digital fastball service at no charge  but are working on strategic initiatives to generate digital fastball revenue 
however  many systems are already available for sharing files over the internet  in some cases at little or no cost 
in addition  some such systems have been the targets of widely publicized litigation by copyright holders  which may make some companies reluctant to use internet based digital delivery services such as digital fastball 
if our development or marketing efforts prove unsuccessful with respect to digital fastball  we may not generate any profit or even recover our investments in the digital fastball service  in which case our business could suffer 
we may raise additional capital to fund acquisitions  product development or general operations 
any such capital financing would dilute our shareholders investments 
we may raise additional capital in the future through private or public offerings of stock  or through other means 
the purposes of any such financing would be to increase our cash reserves for potential use in acquiring other businesses  product development activities  funding our operations and generally strengthening our balance sheet 
any such additional financing would likely dilute the investments of our current shareholders and may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
a large percentage of our stock is owned by a small number of shareholders  which can lead to fluctuations and volatility in our stock price and insurmountable voting power 
as of february   over of our common stock  on an as converted basis  was held by three investors 
those three investors are digital river  inc  crosslink capital  inc  and two affiliated funds  special situations technology fund  lp tech and special situations technology ii  lp tech ii 
because the ownership of our stock is so concentrated  there is a high risk that a large sale of shares by any of those shareholders could cause a rapid decline in our stock price  in which case our other shareholders and the company itself could be harmed 
in addition  the voting power of those shareholders could prove insurmountable in the case of a shareholder vote  which could harm the company and or its other shareholders 
our operating results could vary due to the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies  particularly sfas no 
r 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact our results of operations 
those methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments 
in particular  the calculation of share based compensation expense under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment which we adopted as of the fiscal quarter beginning march  requires that we use valuation methodologies and a number of assumptions  estimates and conclusions regarding matters such as expected terms  expected forfeitures  expected volatility of our share price  the expected dividend rate with respect to our common stock and the exercise behavior of our employees 
furthermore  there are no means  under applicable accounting principles  to compare and adjust our expense if and when we learn of additional information that may affect our previous estimates  with the exception of changes in expected forfeitures of share based awards 
over time  factors may arise that cause us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future share based compensation arrangements  resulting in variability in our share based compensation expense 
in addition  any future accounting pronouncements  taxation rules  and new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  could also have a significant effect on our reported results  including our reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the change 
provisions of our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders  which could depress the trading price of our common stock 
our charter documents  as well as our amended and restated preferred stock rights agreement  contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous 
among other things  these provisions trigger certain shareholder rights in the event a person or entity acquires more than of our voting securities or up to in the cases of crosslink capital  inc and special situations technology funds  establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  require super majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
section imposes certain restrictions on merger  business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of percent or more of our common stock 
viruses may hinder acceptance of internet based digital delivery  which could in turn limit our revenue growth 
the proliferation of software viruses is a key risk that could inhibit acceptance by information technology professionals of web based delivery of digital goods 
any well publicized transmission of a computer virus by us or another company using digital delivery could deter information technology professionals from using  and deter software providers from outsourcing  digital delivery  thereby adversely affecting our business 
our subscribenet service enables our customers to upload their software products directly onto our systems for downloading by their end users 
our systems automatically scan our customers software products for known computer viruses on an ongoing basis while they are on our systems 
however  it is possible that in spite of these periodic virus scans  our system could transmit the virus to one or more end users 
any such virus transmission could result in disputes  litigation and negative publicity that could adversely affect our business and our stock price 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer s data  our service may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 
some companies may be reluctant to use either our subscribenet or digital fastball hosted digital delivery services because they are concerned about the security capabilities of these services 
additional government regulations may harm demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business 
our business has benefited from the tax laws of states in which purchases of software licenses are not taxable if the software is received only electronically 
some such states are considering whether to change their laws to broaden the taxability of transactions fulfilled over the internet 
any new imposition of taxes on sales of software licenses  where the software is received electronically  could substantially harm demand for our services and thereby materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also have benefited from implementing our services in ireland  which offers tax advantages to software companies distributing software from ireland 
any regulatory change in ireland or elsewhere that diminishes those advantages could harm our business 
other changes in government regulations  in areas such as privacy and export compliance  could also require us to implement changes in our services or operations that increase our cost of doing business and thereby hurt our financial performance 
claims by third parties for intellectual property infringement could force us to stop selling our services  force us to pay royalties  and force us to indemnify our customers 
our business involves a high risk that we will be the target of intellectual property infringement claims 
these claims could take a number of forms  including claims by other technology companies alleging that current or future components of our digital delivery service or related services infringe their intellectual property rights  claims by our customers competitors alleging that our customers software  which we store and electronically deliver for our customers  infringes those competitors intellectual property rights our customers would typically be required to defend and indemnify us against such claims  but the claims could nevertheless disrupt our business  claims that our use of the name intraware violates the rights of other entities that are using the same name 
we are aware that certain other companies are using the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark 
while we have received no notice of any claims of trademark infringement from any of those companies  we cannot assure you that these companies may not claim superior rights to intraware or to other marks we use  or claims by our customers that we delivered their software to unauthorized third parties  thereby infringing our customers intellectual property rights 
industry consolidation is increasing the risk that we will become a target of the types of infringement claims described in the first two bullets above 
consolidation among companies providing digital delivery  licensing  e commerce and related technologies is resulting in more direct competition among the surviving companies in that segment  heightening the risk of intellectual property infringement claims among those companies  including us 
similarly  consolidation in the enterprise software industry heightens the risk of intellectual property infringement claims among the companies remaining in that industry  including most of our customers 
these intellectual property claims could be made for patent  copyright or trademark infringement or for misappropriation of trade secrets 
they could be made directly against us  or indirectly through our contractual indemnification obligations to our customers and channel partners 
any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  or cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may be available only on onerous terms  if at all 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover all potential claims or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
we believe we own the rights in  or have the rights required to use  our subscribenet technology 
however  there can be no assurance that this technology does not infringe the rights of third parties 
in addition  we take steps to verify that end users who download our customers software through our subscribenet service are entitled to deploy and use that software 
however  there can be no assurance that this verification procedure will help us defend against claims by  or protect us against liability to  our customers whose software is downloaded 
if our export compliance system fails to prevent unauthorized exports of our customers software  we could be sanctioned by the us government 
through our subscribenet service  we globally distribute software containing encryption technology and other technologies restricted by us laws and regulations from exportation to certain countries  certain types of recipients  and certain specific end users 
our subscribenet solution incorporates automated procedures to help ensure that the software we deliver electronically is not downloaded in violation of us export laws and regulations 
however  these procedures may not prevent unauthorized exports of restricted software in every case 
if an unauthorized export of software occurs through the subscribenet service and the us government determines that we have violated us export laws or regulations  we could be sanctioned under those laws or regulations 
sanctions include fines  suspension or revocation of export privileges  and imprisonment 
if our key personnel left the company  our product development  sales  and corporate management could suffer 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
we do not maintain life insurance on any of our officers or key employees 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could significantly harm our business 
financial and securities laws  especially the sarbanes oxley act of  require that we evaluate our internal control structure 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal controls in place  this exercise has no precedent available by which to measure the adequacy of our compliance  and in addition it may cause our operating expenses to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent registered public accounting firms 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and such new rules and regulations  we are evaluating our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal control over financial reporting 
we are performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required in an effort to comply with the management certification and independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result  we are incurring additional expenses and diversion of management s time  and we may be required to hire additional personnel and engage additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income or increase our net loss 
while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the outcome of our testing and resulting remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is little precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
if we are unable to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq stock market  and our reputation may be harmed 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the price of our common stock 
moreover  our management  including our chief executive officer  ceo and chief financial officer  cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over our financial reporting will eliminate all risk of error or fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
our disclosure controls or procedures could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we will be required by the sarbanes oxley act to include an assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form k beginning with our filing for our fiscal year ending february  our new independent auditing firm may interpret accounting rules differently than our old independent auditing firm  which could require changes in the presentation of our financial data and or cause us to restate prior financial reports 
in september of  we dismissed our prior independent accounting firm and engaged a new one to serve in that role 
consequently  our new independent auditor will be reviewing and auditing our financial reporting in the future  and also will be reviewing our financial reports from earlier periods that previously were reviewed and audited by our old auditing firm 
given the complexities of public company accounting rules and the differences in how those rules are interpreted by various accounting firms  it is possible that our new independent auditor will require us to characterize certain transactions and or present financial data differently than was approved by our former auditor 
similarly  it is possible that our new auditor will disagree with the way we have presented financial results in prior periods  in which case we may be required to restate those financial results 
in either case  these changes could negatively impact our future financial results and or previously reported financial results  could subject us to the expense and other consequences of restating our prior financial statements  and could lead to government investigation and or shareholder litigation 
if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future  or enter into joint ventures  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies in the future 
similarly  we may enter into joint ventures as we try to penetrate new markets 
we are considerably smaller now than we were when we made our past acquisitions  and therefore any new acquisitions or investments could be more disruptive to our organization than in the past 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  services and personnel  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations  risk of entering new markets  potential write offs of acquired assets  potential loss of key employees  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs  and delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
we could face claims in relation to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
we have maintained an espp program for the benefit of our employees since we recently determined that beginning in late  we issued shares that were authorized under our espp plan but which exceeded the number of shares we had registered with the sec on form s in october  we registered additional espp shares with the sec  but it is possible we could face claims for rescission of past purchases or other damages by former employees who lost money selling their espp shares 
it is difficult to predict the overall size of these potential claims because we do not have data showing the extent to which employees or former employees continue to hold their shares or have sold them  or data showing any resulting losses 
while we believe the aggregate amount of potential claims is small  we cannot assure you of this 
we also believe we have valid defenses against any such claims  including without limitation applicable statutes of limitation  but the cost of litigating these issues could be expensive and we cannot assure you we would prevail on all of our defenses or avoid rescinding certain purchases under the espp and or paying damages

in re intraware  inc initial public offering securities litigation in october  we were served with a summons and complaint in a purported securities class action lawsuit 
on or about april   we were served with an amended complaint in this action  which is now titled in re intraware  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from february  the date of our initial public offering through december  it names as defendants intraware  three of our present and former officers and directors  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of  as amended  and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the amended complaint also alleges that the underwriters misused their securities analysts to manipulate the price of our stock 
no specific damages are claimed 
lawsuits containing similar allegations have been filed in the southern district of new york challenging over other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in and all of these lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before united states district court judge shira scheindlin of the southern district of new york 
on july   an omnibus motion to dismiss was filed in the coordinated litigation on behalf of the issuer defendants  of which intraware and its three named current and former officers and directors are a part  on common pleadings issues 
on or about october   the court entered and ordered a stipulation of dismissal  which dismissed the three named current and former officers and directors from the litigation without prejudice 
on february   the court entered an order denying in part the issuer defendants omnibus motion to dismiss  including those portions of the motion to dismiss relating to intraware 
in june  a stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants  including us  was submitted to the court 
the underwriter defendants in the in re initial public offering securities litigation collectively  the underwriter defendants  including the underwriters of our initial public offering  are not parties to the stipulation of settlement 
the settlement provides that  in exchange for a release of claims against the settling issuer defendants  the insurers of all of the settling issuer defendants will provide a surety undertaking to guarantee plaintiffs a billion recovery from the non settling defendants  including the underwriter defendants 
if the plaintiffs recover at least billion from the underwriter defendants  our insurers would have no liability for settlement payments under the terms of the settlement 
if the plaintiffs recover less than billion  we believe our insurance will likely cover our share of any payments towards satisfying plaintiffs billion recovery deficit 
management estimates that its range of loss relative to this matter is zero to million 
presently there is no more likely point estimate of loss within this range 
as a consequence of the uncertainties described above regarding the amount we will ultimately be required to pay  if any  as of february   we have not accrued a liability for this matter 
on august   the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement 
a fairness hearing for the settlement took place in april after the hearing  the court took the matter under submission and has not yet issued a final ruling 
in addition  on december   the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the class certification order of the district court judge  and concluded that none of the six focus cases presented to the appellate court for consideration can be certified as a class action 
the court then denied a rehearing of the issue on april  it remains unclear as of this date whether or how this new ruling will impact the settlement currently under consideration by the district court

our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations 
overview intraware was founded in and went public in february our goal is to become the de facto standard among digital delivery solution providers 
we are pursuing various strategic objectives to achieve this goal 
first  we are working to become a profitable  cash generating company by growing our subscribenet business and practicing stringent fiscal responsibility 
second  we are actively increasing our efforts to reach markets outside our existing enterprise software developer customer base 
we intend to leverage our digital delivery and entitlement expertise  and expanded service offering  to penetrate new markets and new market segments 
third  we are seeking to strengthen our technological advantage and extend the breadth of our functionality in the electronic software delivery and entitlement management area by further improving our central offering through internal research and development  through alliances with adjacent technology providers  and through development efforts to bring new capabilities to our services to help us access new markets 
we also seek to continue extending and strengthening our customer base by executing on our sales and marketing plan and by providing exceptional customer service 
during our fiscal year we launched digital fastball  an electronic content delivery and management service designed for small and medium sized business professionals 
our central offering is the subscribenet service 
subscribenet is an on demand solution for digital asset management and delivery that enables technology companies to deliver digital files and interact with customers in an efficient and controlled manner 
our traditional market for the subscribenet service has been enterprise technology companies 
subscribenet allows software providers and their channel partners to distribute software online  manage licensing and entitlement across their global customer bases  track and report deliveries and download activity  and manage export compliance 
by using the subscribenet service  customers can reduce their costs associated with manufacturing  packaging and distributing physical cds  and  automate and simplify their software licensing processes 
subscribenet also enhances export and revenue recognition compliance 
we believe the subscribenet service also has broad application beyond the enterprise technology industry  including the delivery and entitlement management of digital goods such as video  music  and content 
accordingly  we are expanding our efforts to reach these new markets 
one market of particular interest to us is video delivery  including feature length films 
leveraging our core subscribenet technology  we intend to develop a media entertainment offering to help owners of valuable media content deliver their products in digital form  either through distribution channels or directly to consumers 
we believe our technology is well suited to digital entertainment distribution because we have the ability to store and deliver large files at high speeds  and a unique system of entitlement controls to prevent unauthorized downloads of valuable digital content 
we also see similar opportunities for the delivery and management of music  game files and various forms of digital media 
our newly launched digital fastball service uses our network to provide users a fast and secure means of controlling ongoing access of their valuable digital content to a specified list of recipients across the globe 
the underlying technology and infrastructure is based upon our subscribenet technology  which our customers use for electronic software delivery and management 
we currently are offering digital fastball as a free service to establish a user community and generate word of mouth marketing 
in the longer term  we intend to develop and market our digital fastball technology on a revenue generating basis in targeted industries where the need for entitlement controls and large file delivery is greatest 
in such cases  we most likely would help companies in those industries incorporate our digital fastball functionality with their own systems and in their own look and feel 
we also are exploring opportunities to provide enhanced digital fastball technology with separate branding for both consumer and commercial uses  and are devoting engineering and marketing resources toward that end 
important trends we currently see a number of trends in the marketplace that are important for our business 
perhaps the most significant trend is the increasing role our licensing technology is playing in our business  which over the past two years has become at least as important as our electronic software delivery services 
in most respects  this has been a positive development for us 
for example  the typical contract value for our license solution is often higher than that of electronic software delivery  and it has gained market acceptance over a shorter period of time than electronic software delivery  which may suggest the service addresses a more critical and immediate problem for our potential customers 
we also believe our software as a service model gives us a competitive advantage relative to our major competitors because we can usually offer customers delivery and entitlement management services more quickly  and at less cost  than if they purchase an installed software application that requires a significant license fee and extensive professional services work 
the shift toward our licensing solution also carries risks  however  because sales of our licensing service involve more complex implementations and more professional services work than sales of our other services 
thus  while we believe our licensing solution requires substantially less professional services work than the installed software applications sold by our competitors  our implementations of the licensing service have taken longer and been more challenging than implementations of our software delivery services 
consequently  it has taken substantially more time for us to recognize revenue from those contracts 
moreover  the increased emphasis on our licensing solution has played a major role in increasing the percentage of our revenues that are derived from professional services 
unlike our recurring subscription fees which are relatively predictable and have favorable profit margins professional services revenues are neither recurring nor predictable quarter over quarter  and they often carry lower profit margins 
over time  we expect to gain efficiencies in our licensing implementations as we continue to build repeatable processes and learn from implementations we have already performed 
for the foreseeable future  however  we face risks that our growing dependence on our licensing solution could delay our ability to recognize revenue  negatively impact our profit margins  and make it more difficult to forecast our future results 
if some or all of those challenges continue or worsen  our business operations and results could suffer 
another ongoing trend for us is the pace of mergers and acquisitions in the enterprise software sector 
these consolidations pose both opportunities and risks for us  potentially leading either to growth in our contracts with those customers if they grow larger  or to cancellation of customer contracts if our customers merge or are acquired by companies that do not use our subscribenet service 
some of our largest customers  for example  began using our subscribenet service as the result of acquiring companies with whom we had existing agreements 
over the last fiscal year  however  we lost a number of customers as the result of their being acquired by companies that do not use our services 
most of those customers were relatively small  but in the aggregate those customer losses materially impacted our results 
one strategy we have adopted to address this risk is to focus our sales resources on a relatively small number of large companies  rather than scattering our sales efforts across the full range of smaller companies that are more susceptible to acquisitions 
however  we will continue to face the risk of losing customers to acquisitions in the current fiscal year  and it is always possible those losses could involve larger customers if they are acquired 
the continued consolidation in our industry may also indicate that we will face increased competition from significantly larger and more established entities in the future 
we also have increased our efforts to expand into new markets for a number of different reasons 
as noted above  we believe the underlying technology of our subscribenet service is well suited to provide digital delivery and entitlement management for many digital goods other than software  including video  music and content 
in our view  those markets offer tremendous growth opportunities for digital services like ours over the next five years 
consequently  in addition to our ongoing development and marketing of our core service to enterprise software companies  we are increasing our efforts to develop and market a media entertainment service and to find commercial applications for our digital fastball service 
we think this expanded focus is particularly appropriate in light of the steady but measured pace with which enterprise software companies are adopting digital delivery and management services 
we believe software vendors will continue migrating toward digital delivery of software and license keys  and that the pace of that migration will increase 
however  the adoption rate for electronic software delivery and to a lesser extent license delivery has gone more slowly than we had predicted and led to a lagging growth rate 
we therefore believe our best growth strategy is to continue improving our subscribenet service to capitalize on digital adoption in the software industry  while moving quickly to position ourselves to seize opportunities in new markets where our technology has obvious applications 
one trend that has become more prevalent over the past year  and which we expect to continue  is an increase in variable billing provisions in our customer agreements 
typically  these variable billing terms provide that a portion of customer fees will be based upon the number of transactions the customer processes through our service 
in large part  we attribute this increase to our penetration of markets outside the traditional enterprise software sector  and to our agreements with large digital distributors who have contracted with us to process their deliveries 
we believe these agreements have been beneficial to the company  but the trend toward variable billings carries the risk that our future revenues will be less stable and less predictable 
in addition  we see a number of sustained trends that we have discussed in previous filings 
for example  technology companies continue moving toward outsourcing operational functions to reduce costs 
our services enable enterprise software companies to outsource key operational functions in a manner we believe is financially compelling 
therefore  we may benefit from this ongoing trend in the current fiscal year 
hosted web based applications which in the past have been limited by concerns about speed  reliability and security continue to gain acceptance among mainstream businesses  largely because of the cost savings they can offer 
this trend may benefit us because our subscribenet service is a hosted web based application 
we also note that beginning on november   in accordance with our series b convertible preferred stock purchase agreement with digital river  inc  digital river may request that we file a registration statement on form s to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock 
upon the effectiveness of that registration statement  digital river will have the ability to sell shares of our stock that it has converted to common shares 
we foresee that a large sale of our stock by digital river could have a negative impact on our stock price 
we earn revenues and generate cash principally through recurring service fees charged for our subscribenet service  and professional services fees charged for customization of our subscribenet service 
principal sources of revenue and cash also included  until august   cost reimbursement received for our sales and marketing services provided to software spectrum and  until january   our profit sharing with software spectrum 
this change in business in fiscal was a critical part of our long term strategy of moving out of less profitable reselling activities to growing and investing in our leading digital delivery and entitlement offering 
as a result of this change  our overall revenues decreased while our online services and technology revenues and gross margins increased in fiscal in the absence of any unexpected losses of key customers  we believe our online services and technology revenues will continue to grow because we anticipate that a majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts  that additional services may be delivered to existing customers  and that new customers will be added to the subscribenet service 
as of march  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and accordingly  have not restated the consolidated results of operations from prior interim periods and fiscal years 
under sfas r  we are required to measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
stock options issued under our equity plans  as well as stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  are subject to sfas r 
during our fiscal year we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation  which largely accounted for our increases in net losses 
during fiscal we increased our net losses to approximately million  from million in fiscal at the same time  during fiscal we generated approximately  in cash from operating activities  a significant improvement over the million used in the fiscal we have incurred losses during each fiscal year since our inception 
on august   we adopted our equity incentive plan the plan  which was approved by our shareholders on october  the plan replaces our stock option plan the plan  which expired in november the plan will expire on august  the plan is an omnibus equity plan consisting of a variety of equity vehicles to provide flexibility in using equity awards  including incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares  performance units and dividend equivalents 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we offered to certain employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock option restricted stock unit exchange program exchange program 
under the exchange program  we offered employees the right to exchange eligible stock options for restricted stock units 
eligible stock options were all unexercised and unvested stock options with an exercise price per share of or more 
the offer was made to foster employee retention and better align the interest of employees and stockholders to maximize stockholder value 
we believe that the offer will also help us use our employee compensation resources more efficiently 
the number of restricted stock units that an employee receives in exchange for the eligible stock options  as well as the vesting schedule of those restricted stock units  depended on the number and exercise price of the eligible stock options exchanged 
in order to achieve profitability  we will need to generate higher revenue and continue to manage our expenses 
our ability to generate higher revenues and achieve profitability depends on many factors  including the demand for our products and services  the level of product and price competition  market acceptance of our new products  and general economic conditions 
in this regard  we continue to invest in areas that we believe can accelerate revenue growth and to manage expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
although we measure the condition and performance of our business in numerous ways  the key quantitative indicators that we generally use to manage the business are total annual contract value  adoption rates or number of end users on the service  customer wins  and margins 
of these indicators  we think contract value and end users are the best predictors of short term performance 
the total annual contract value metric is used to approximate what the total ongoing annual subscribenet service fees would be under our existing contracts with our customers  assuming all those contracts renewed on their current terms and  in the case of variable fee contracts  the customers maintained the same level of fee generating activity as they had in the prior twelve months 
however  we cannot guarantee that those assumptions will be true  as we describe further below 
we define total annual contract value as  on any given date  the aggregate annual service fees paid or expected to be paid by our customers for services we have contracted to provide during the then current annual periods of the customers respective contracts with us 
to be included in total annual contract value  service fees must be either contractually required to be paid  or expected to be paid based on a minimum month history of prior charges and payments that were not required by contractual minimums 
total annual contract value includes amounts that have been recognized as revenue as well as amounts that may be recognized as revenue in the future 
during fiscal year  our total annual contract value remained fairly consistent over the prior fiscal year while our end users who receive and manage their software using the subscribenet service grew substantially 
as of april   the total annual contract value of our subscribenet service customer base was million 
the total annual contract value of our subscribenet service customer base as of april   was million 
we believe the increase in end users could benefit our financial performance by driving customers to increase their subscribenet service fee commitment levels in future periods 
we caution that total annual contract value is not necessarily indicative of current revenues or of future revenues in any given fiscal period  and should not be relied upon to assess our financial condition 
in addition to the risk factors in item a  factors that could cause differences between total annual contract value and revenues include unexpected contract terminations  reductions in customer activity  the application of our revenue recognition policies described under critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and under revenue recognition in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  and the occurrence of any contingencies that make deferral of revenue recognition appropriate under any given contract 
we also caution that total annual contract value is different from backlog 
backlog typically excludes amounts already recognized as revenue  while total annual contract value may include amounts already recognized as revenue for portions of the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts 
in addition  total annual contract value includes fees that are paid  payable or expected for the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts  even if we expect to provide the related services after our current fiscal year 
we believe that the effects of our capital financings to date  our past and current strategic actions to improve revenue  and our ongoing cost controls  will generate sufficient cash resources to fund our future operations 
however  if we fail to adequately increase our revenues or control spending  our business could suffer material adverse effects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity  we will need to add significant numbers of customers and end users to our service 
as a result of this anticipated growth we will incur increased personnel costs and costs associated with upgrading and expanding our infrastructure at various stages to meet the needs of our customers 
the timing of these expenses could place negative pressure on our gross profit margins and earnings 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future revenues 
to the extent that our competitors successfully introduce products or services with higher market acceptance  our revenues would be negatively affected 
if revenues are lower than expected due to lower customer growth or losses in key customers  we may experience difficulty in adjusting expense levels in a timely manner 
to meet emerging market needs we may also acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies to further strengthen our technology 
we also face a number of key risks that are not discussed in this md a  but are described in more detail in the risk factors section in item a 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  costs of deferred revenue  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  and income taxes to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we have provided the service to the customer  made the software available for customer download through our website  or shipped the software to the customer  we believe collection of these fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our online services and technology revenue results primarily from three types of arrangements 
first  it results from sales of our subscribenet digital delivery service to software vendors and other companies that distribute software as part of their business 
second  it results from professional services that we provide to customize our subscribenet service for customers  to convert data for customers  and to integrate our proprietary software 
third  it results from our resale of third party services or licenses complementary to our subscribenet service  one of which is e commerce 
in addition  if appropriate opportunities present themselves in the future  we may generate online services and technology revenue from the sale of licenses to our proprietary software  and related maintenance  to companies using those products internally or using those products to provide web based services to their customers 
alliance and reimbursement revenue primarily relates to our former alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales and marketing services 
this revenue consisted of a percentage of the gross profit derived from software spectrum s sales of the third party software and maintenance for which we provided sales and marketing services  and  prior to august   reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to providing sales and marketing services to software spectrum for that third party software and maintenance 
this revenue was recognized as we provided the services to software spectrum 
on august   we signed an updated agreement with software spectrum 
under the updated agreement  software spectrum paid us a higher percentage of the gross profit derived from its sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
however  software spectrum stopped reimbursing us for our direct costs in maintaining a team dedicated to sales of sun software licenses and maintenance 
we terminated our alliance agreement with software spectrum effective january   in connection with the sale of our sun one customer list to fusionstorm 
that sale was completed on january  we ceased recognizing alliance and reimbursement revenue on that date 
we defer online services and technology revenues related to our subscribenet digital delivery service and generally recognize them ratably over the term of the service arrangement 
the typical subscription term is one year  although some may be shorter or extend up to approximately three years 
our customer contracts are generally noncancelable  though customers usually have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
a majority of our subscribenet service implementations for new customers involve customization essential to the functionality of the service 
in these cases  we defer revenue recognition until the service go live date is reached  and then recognize the subscribenet revenue on a ratable basis over the remaining contract term if the implementation is bundled 
if the implementation fees are charged separately  then the associated revenue is recognized in accordance with our professional services revenue recognition policy  as stated below 
the go live date is the later of the date on which acceptance has been received subsequent to the delivery of the essential functionality is delivered or the point at which no additional customization is required 
our subscribenet contracts with customers normally give the customer a period of time generally five days to evaluate a subscribenet implementation after we have completed it  and provide that the customer is deemed to have accepted the implementation if it has not affirmatively rejected it within that period 
we typically rely on such non rejections by customers to indicate their acceptance of implementations 
we also sell additional professional services related to subscribenet agreements 
generally  these services do not provide stand alone value to a customer and  accordingly  we defer recognition of this revenue until the go live date for the professional services  similar to the manner in which we treat subscribenet service revenues discussed above 
such professional services revenues are recognized ratably over the longer of the remaining estimated customer life or the remaining contract term  commencing with the acceptance of the professional services 
estimated customer life requires that we periodically estimate the projected life of our existing customers based on historical information such as customer renewal rates 
in some instances the implementation of the subscribenet service and professional services are bundled into the initial agreement without specifically stating the fees for each one 
in these instances the professional services fees are recognized from acceptance to the end of the remaining contract term on a ratable basis with the subscribenet fee 
online services and technology revenues related to our resale of third party services or software licenses complementary to our subscribenet service are generally recognized as the service is provided 
if the service or license resold involves customization essential to the functionality of the underlying subscribenet service  the fees charged for the customization are recognized as revenue in the same manner as professional services discussed above 
resold services or licenses are recognized as revenue based on the gross fee charged to the customer  since we bear the credit risk for resold services or licenses  have latitude in establishing pricing  and are primarily responsible for acceptability of the services or licenses delivered 
in addition  costs paid to the third party providers are recorded as cost of revenues and recognized in the same manner as the related revenue 
we have service level commitment obligations to our customers 
revenues reserves  including potential customer credits related to unmet service level commitments  are established in the same period that the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience adjusted for other known trends and factors 
our revenue reserves are subject to management s best judgment  and actual customer credits could be different from our estimates resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results 
deferred costs we capitalize direct costs of revenues related to significant subscribenet service implementations and established professional services contracts associated with our subscribenet services 
direct costs include compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to the time spent on significant implementation and professional services activities 
these costs are recognized over the same period as the related revenue is recognized see revenue recognition above 
costs associated with professional services involving significant new functionality for the subscribenet service that are partially or fully funded by customers  but which do not qualify as funded research and development activities  are expensed as cost of revenues as incurred until a working model is delivered to the customer 
once a working model has been delivered  all additional direct costs are capitalized in the same manner discussed above 
any changes in our estimated customer life estimates could result in corresponding changes to our recognition of deferred revenues and costs 
a increase in our estimated customer life during the fiscal year ended february  would have caused a decrease in the amortization of both deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues  resulting in an increase in net loss totaling approximately  at february   we had approximately million in capitalized costs relating to deferred revenues 
we expense customer acquisition costs  including sales commissions  as incurred 
we also defer legal costs incurred in connection with patent applications 
as of february  we had million in deferred legal costs 
upon issuance of a patent  the deferred legal costs for that patent are expensed ratably over the patent s useful life 
stock based compensation on march   intraware adopted sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
using the modified prospective method  we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r 
an amendment of sfas nos 
and  staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for our prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
an increase in our stock volatility or a decrease in the average expected life of our outstanding options could lead to an increase in our stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r 
furthermore  there are no means under applicable accounting principles to compare and adjust our expense if and when we learn of additional information that may affect our previous estimates  with the exception of changes in expected forfeitures of share based awards 
over time  factors may arise that cause us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future share based compensation arrangements  resulting in variability in our share based compensation expense 
in addition  any future accounting pronouncements  taxation rules  and new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  could have a significant effect on our reported results  including our reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the change 
see note of financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
web site development costs we account for web site development costs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for website development costs  which requires that certain costs to develop web sites be capitalized or expensed  depending on the nature of the costs 
we amortize web site development costs using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of two years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our inability to collect required payments from our customers 
when evaluating the adequacy of this allowance  we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customers payment history 
we may need to record increases to our allowance balances in the future 
any dispute  early contract termination or other collection issue related to these receivable balances could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operations 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing our financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
given that we have incurred losses since inception and therefore have not been required to pay income taxes  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at february  in the event that we are able to recognize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period that this is determined 
results of operations total revenue the following table sets forth the revenue  changes in revenue and percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended february  february  february  total change of revenue total change of revenue total of revenue revenues online services and technology    alliance and reimbursement    related party online services and technology software product sales total revenues  revenues for online services and technology for the year ended february   increased from the prior year due to several factors 
there was an increase in revenues of approximately million from existing subscribenet customers whose go live date occurred during our fiscal year ended february  or the beginning of our fiscal year ended february   an increase of approximately million in revenue was recognized as a result of additional professional services provided to existing subscribenet customers  an increase of approximately million from existing subscribenet customers who signed new amendments to their agreements that resulted in higher contract values  an increase of approximately million related to new customers obtained during our fiscal year ended february  and an increase of million related to the reduction of the revenue reserve 
these increases were partially offset by an approximate million decrease in relation to customers who terminated their contracts and an approximate decrease in revenue related to the terminated software spectrum reseller agreement 
revenues for combined online services and technology for the year ended february   increased from our fiscal year ended february  primarily due to a net increase of approximately million in revenue from subscribenet customers 
there was an increase in revenues of approximately million from customers whose go live date was late in our fiscal year ended february   an increase of million related to new agreements that resulted in higher contract values for existing customers and million of the increase was due to new customers obtained in our fiscal year ended february  there was also an increase in revenues of million related to e commerce services 
revenues for related party online service and technology revenue for the year ended february  decreased from the prior year due to the termination of our strategic alliance agreement with zomax  inc we expect our combined online services and technology revenues for our fiscal year ended february  to increase from those in our fiscal year ended february  as customers continue to be added to the service and implementation cycles become complete 
alliance and reimbursement revenue relates to our alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales of sun software licenses and maintenance  which we terminated january  there was no alliance and reimbursement revenue for our fiscal year ended february  in prior periods  this revenue consisted of a percentage of the gross profit derived from the sales of sun software licenses and maintenance services  and reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun software for software spectrum 
the decrease in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   compared to the year ended february   was primarily due to software spectrum no longer reimbursing us for our direct costs in maintaining a team dedicated to sales of sun software licenses and maintenance and our termination of our alliance agreement with software spectrum 
we do not expect to recognize any alliance and reimbursement revenues for our fiscal year ending february  software product revenue for the year ended february  was a result of our business of reselling third party software products and related maintenance 
we do not expect to recognize future revenues from our former third party resale activities 
however  we may recognize future revenues from products and services complementary to our subscribenet service  which originate with other companies and are sold to customers through us as part of a comprehensive business solution 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended february  february  february  total change of revenue total change of revenue total of revenue total cost of revenues  gross profit  operating expenses sales and marketing   product development   general and administrative    restructuring gain loss on disposal of assets total operating expenses  cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to approximately million for our fiscal year ended february  from approximately million for our fiscal year ended february  in our prior fiscal year we had approximately million in cost of revenues associated with alliance and reimbursement revenue 
we ceased recognizing cost or revenues associated with alliance and reimbursement revenues in our fiscal year ended february  our gross margin increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal  which was a decrease from for fiscal the gross margin increase in our fiscal year was a result of no longer recognizing costs associated with alliance and reimbursement revenues 
the gross margin related to online services and technology for the year ended february  remained consistent with gross margin from the prior year 
the gross margin decrease for the year ended february   compared to the year ended february  primarily reflects the decrease we had experienced in our alliance and reimbursement revenues 
cost of revenues primarily consists of certain allocated costs related to our internet connectivity  depreciation of assets supporting cost of revenues  and customer support  and in the prior year  the costs associated with maintaining our team dedicated to helping software spectrum sell sun software 
cost of revenues also consists of professional services personnel costs and the cost of third party products and services sold 
we expect total cost of revenues for our fiscal year ended february  to be slightly lower than our cost of revenues for our fiscal year ended february  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
in addition  we expect our gross profit margin percentage to increase from our fiscal year ended february  levels due to lower total costs and expected increases in revenues for online services and technology revenue 
in general we expect our total revenues to increase at a higher rate then our total costs of revenues 
our cost of revenues may fluctuate based on multiple variables  including without limitations  revenue mix fluctuations  levels of professional services activities  infrastructure costs  and variable external support utilization rates 
we expect our margins to fluctuate accordingly 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  advertising  promotional materials and trade show expenses 
the increase in our sales and marketing expense for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to increased personnel costs 
there was an increase in salaries of approximately million related to an increase in time personnel spent focused on sales and marketing activities  an increase of approximately million for stock compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r and an increase of approximately million related to commission expense 
the decrease in our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   is primarily due to a decrease of approximately million related to marketing and advertising  which was part of our planned decrease in sales and marketing expenditures 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses in our fiscal year ending february  to remain fairly consistent with our fiscal year ended february  we cannot give assurance  however  that any new efforts to improve our marketing will result in additional sales or revenues 
product development expenses product development expenses primarily consist of personnel  consulting  software and related maintenance  equipment depreciation expense and allocated overhead costs 
costs related to research  design and development of products and services have been charged to product development expense as incurred 
the increase in our product development expenses for the year ended february  compared to those for the year ended february   is the result of increased personnel costs and an increase allocated overhead costs to product development activities 
there was an increase of approximately million for stock compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r 
other personnel costs increased approximately million 
these costs included salaries  the newly implemented bonus plan and recruiting fees for new personnel 
an increase in time spent on product development activities accounted for the remainder of the increase 
these costs included allocated overhead costs  expenditures that were a result of variable support costs and incremental investment in our infrastructure related to product development activities 
most notably was approximately million of costs attributed to the digital fastball service 
the decrease in our product development expenses for the year ended february   compared to those for the year ended february   was due primarily to a decrease in our internal efforts on product development activities of approximately million 
during the year ended february   the product development teams temporarily increased their focus on cost of revenues activities  as described in cost of revenues above 
we anticipate continuing to invest in additional functionality for our subscribenet service and underlying proprietary software 
however  we expect those investments to fluctuate over time  and expect our product development expenses to fluctuate accordingly 
we expect total product development expenditures to remain fairly consistent with our fiscal year ending february  we cannot give assurance that our product development efforts will result in new or improved products  features or functionality  or that the market will accept the improvements to existing or new products  features or functionality developed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive personnel  fees for professional services  uncollectible account activity and certain allocated overhead costs 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   was due to several factors first  approximately  for stock compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r  of which approximately  is attributable to the accelerated vesting of options for our former chief operating officer as part of his severance agreement  second  approximately  for increased personnel costs related to the newly implemented bonus plan and administrative related payroll expense  and third   million related to severance paid to our former chief operating officer 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our accounting and legal fees for the year of approximately  our general and administrative expenses for the year ended february  were consistent with the year ended february  we expect total general and administrative expenses to decrease in our fiscal year ending february  due to an expected decrease of stock compensation expense and the one time severance costs incurred in the fiscal year ended february  related to the departure of our former chief operating officer 
stock compensation expense is expected to decrease as employee stock options with higher fair values become fully amortized  or certain unvested employee stock options become cancelled as part of the employee stock option restricted stock unit exchange program exchange program described in note  subsequent events 
restructuring expenses for the year ended february   we incurred no expenses related to restructuring 
restructuring expense for the year ended february  was related to severance payments of  made to employees who were terminated in connection with our sale of our sun software resale activities to fusionstorm 
restructuring expense recoupment for the year ended february  was related to a payroll tax refund for previously overpaid payroll taxes of approximately  these overpaid payroll taxes related to supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for involuntarily terminated employees during our restructuring events in december  august and may gain loss on disposal of assets for the year ended february  we incurred a loss on the disposal of assets of approximately  for the years ended february  and february   we recognized a gain loss of approximately  and  on the disposal of assets  respectively 
for the year ended february   there was a gain of  related to the sale of our sun software resale activities to fusionstorm 
the losses were related to the disposal of computer hardware 
interest expense interest expense primarily relates to obligations under notes payable 
for the years ended february   february  and february   interest expense was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense over the stated periods is due to the reduction of the principal balance on our notes payable  slightly offset by higher interest rates 
as of february   we have no outstanding debt or capital lease obligations  accordingly  we do not expect to incur any interest expense for the fiscal year ended february  interest and other income for the years ended february   february  and february   interest and other income was approximately million  million and million of income  respectively 
interest and other income primarily relates to interest earned on our investment balances 
the increase in interest and other income for the years ended february  and february  are primarily the result of increased investment balances  resulting from the million investment in our series b convertible preferred stock by digital river in november  and an increase in the interest rates in the investment account 
the increase in interest and other income for the year ended february  is also the result of the settlement of a litigation matter entitled leon segen v 
comvest venture partners  lp et al  from which we received  the complaint alleged that between august and january  various comvest defendants owned more than of our common stock  bought and sold our equity securities within a month period  and failed to disgorge to us the profits allegedly realized in those trades  thereby violating section b of the exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
certain of the comvest defendants were members of our board of directors between april and may the complaint demanded repayment to intraware of the profits allegedly realized and retained in violation of section b of the exchange act  together with interest and legal costs 
in april  the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which the comvest defendants paid us approximately  net of estimated attorney fees and costs  in settlement of all claims 
income taxes as of february   the company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of about million and million  respectively 
these net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income and will expire at various dates between and if not utilized 
in addition  the company had federal and state credits of approximately  and  respectively 
these federal research and development credits will expire beginning in and ending in  the state credits will carry forward indefinitely 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
net loss for the year ended february   our net loss increased to a million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended february  the increase in our net loss is primarily the result of million in stock compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r  of which approximately  is attributable to the accelerated vesting of options for our former chief operating officer as part of his severance agreement 
we also incurred approximately  in relation to severance costs from terminated employees 
we expect our net loss for the quarter ended may  to be lower than the loss for the quarter ended february  liquidity and capital resources the following table presents our liquidity position at the end of our fiscal years and in thousands for the years ended february  february  cash and cash equivalents   working capital   net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash provided by used in financing activities  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended february   we generated approximately  from operating activities  an increase from million used in the prior fiscal year 
we used cash in operating activities in all fiscal years prior to this increase was primarily due to two factors first  increased billings from new customers and professional services which are reflected in the increase in our deferred revenue balance  and second  an increase in collection efforts in relation to our outstanding accounts receivable 
the majority of our operating costs continue to relate to employee payroll and related expenditures 
we expect to continue to improve our cash provided by operations by increasing our billings to customers as more end users are added to our subscribenet service 
our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows in future periods will largely depend on our ability to increase the number of customers of our subscribenet service while increasing existing subscriptions through strong contract renewals 
our net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended february  this primarily resulted from paying all of our outstanding notes payable related to our equipment advance agreements 
our total payments in relation to our notes payable for our fiscal year ended february  totaled  the cash used in financing activities was slightly offset from  of cash we received during the year from the previously mentioned equipment advance agreements and  in proceeds from the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock in connection with our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended february  included approximately  for our purchase of fixed assets 
we originally paid for these equipment purchases from our cash and cash equivalents  but later drew down approximately  under the above mentioned equipment advance agreements to partially finance these purchases 
the equipment advance agreements had a zero balance as of february  we used these fixed asset purchases primarily to upgrade and expand our subscribenet infrastructure and corporate information systems 
we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents to finance additional fixed asset purchases 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and financing arrangements for the foreseeable future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and any expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
however  if our business declines from its current level  we could be forced to seek additional capital to fund our operations 
commitments the following table summarizes our lease obligations and contractual commitments at february  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
this table provides information through our year ending february   as we do not have any lease obligations or contractual commitments beyond that point 
payments due by period total less than year years a operating leases  contractual commitments a includes payments from march  through february  the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
these contracts are primarily related to services that directly support our subscribenet service and infrastructure 
as of february   our series a and series b redeemable convertible preferred stock entitled the holders to liquidation preferences of a minimum of million and million or  if greater  the market price of the common stock into which the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible  respectively  in the event of our liquidation 
off balance sheet arrangements at february   we had no other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise had we engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the securities and exchange commission sec staff has indicated that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  as a result  is effective for intraware in our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas replaces the different definitions of fair value in the accounting literature with a single definition 
it defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for our fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at the end of fiscal year  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio during fiscal year we place our investments with high quality issuers  by policy  in an effort to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer 
all of our sales are in united states dollars and therefore we do not have any significant foreign currency exchange risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents portfolio 
the effect of changes in interest rates of over a six month horizon would not have a material effect on the fair value of the portfolio 
any declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
