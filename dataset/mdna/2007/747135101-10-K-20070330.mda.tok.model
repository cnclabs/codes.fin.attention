overview pyramid breweries inc is engaged in the brewing  marketing and selling of craft beers under the pyramid and mactarnahan s labels 
until the end of  we also produced a line of gourmet sodas under the thomas kemper soda company label  which we subsequently sold in january as more fully discussed below 
we operate two alehouse restaurants adjacent to our full production breweries under the pyramid alehouse and mactarnahan taproom brand names in berkeley  california and portland  oregon  respectively  and three alehouse restaurants located in walnut creek and sacramento  california and seattle  washington 
as of december   our products were distributed in approximately states within the us through a network of selected independent distributors and brokers 
our revenues consist primarily of sales of beer and soda to third party distributors who distribute to independent retailers and retail sales of beer  soda  food  apparel and other items in our alehouse restaurants 
for the years ended december   and respectively  approximately  and of our net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors  while total retail alehouse sales accounted for  and  respectively 
we sell our craft beers in bottles and kegs 
although bottled products normally sell for a higher per barrel selling price  gross margin on our draft products are typically higher as a percentage compared to bottled products 
changes in the proportion of sales of bottled and draft products therefore will affect our gross margin 
for  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our sales of craft beers were bottled products 
on july   we completed our purchase of certain portland brewing company portland brewing assets which included assets of the brewery and alehouse for total consideration  including transaction costs  of approximately million  consisting of a combination of assumed liabilities  cash and  shares of pyramid common stock valued at per share 
at the time of the acquisition  we entered into a contract brewing arrangement and other commercial arrangements with portland brewing whereby we subleased to portland brewing the premises on which the portland brewery is located and leased to portland brewing certain brewery equipment  engaged portland brewing to produce certain company branded beers on those premises  provided employees to portland brewing for portland brewing s use in brewery operations  subleased to portland brewing 
table of contents the premises on which the mactarnahan s taproom is located  and provided staffing and on site management of the alehouse 
during the second quarter of  we consolidated brewery operations by moving all seattle production to the portland brewery operated by portland brewing in an effort to reduce production costs and streamline production and distribution 
subsequently  in august  we sold substantially all equipment located in the seattle  washington brewing facility  resulting in a reported gain of approximately  for the year ended december  the seattle alehouse restaurant continues to produce beer locally in its small  on site brewery 
during  the ttb concluded its audit of certain federal excise tax returns and related operations of the company and the ttb s findings were presented to us 
among other things  the ttb reviewed our contract brewing arrangement with portland brewing 
at the conclusion of the audit  the ttb asserted that we  not portland brewing  had legal control of the portland brewery facility for purposes of the federal excise tax laws and consequently had underpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at that facility during the period january  through may  the ttb also concluded that since portland brewing was not the legal brewer at the portland brewery facility  it had overpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at the facility 
based on its findings in the audit  the ttb issued us a notice of proposed assessment asserting that we owed a total of approximately million in excise taxes and interest for that period  which did not take into account the approximately million in excise taxes paid by portland brewing on beer produced at the portland brewery facility during the same period 
after receiving the notice of proposed assessment  we engaged in discussions with the ttb relating to a possible compromise of the assessment and also voluntarily began to pay federal excise taxes on beer produced at the portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at that facility ie  at a higher average rate per barrel 
as a result of our discussions with the ttb  we reached an agreement with the ttb that we will pay  to resolve all issues arising from the audit  including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue  which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by portland brewing for the period at issue  due to portland brewing s waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an initial payment of  with the remaining balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years  at a variable interest rate estimated at 
in september  based on our discussions with the ttb and portland brewing  we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with portland brewing to comply with the ttb s interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that portland brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the portland brewery facility 
consequently  we elected to terminate the contract brewing and other commercial arrangements with portland brewing 
in the fourth quarter  after the receipt of all state and federal authorizations required  we formally assumed all brewery and alehouse operations at our brewery and alehouse facilities in portland  oregon 
on january   we completed the sale of the thomas kemper soda brand and related net assets and liabilities tk soda assets to the kemper company  a new company formed by adventure funds  a portland based equity investment fund 
under terms of the transactions  we received million for thomas kemper soda assets including the brand and intellectual property  soda kegs  vehicles and point of sale materials 
the transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which we will continue to manufacture thomas kemper soda products for kemper at its breweries in portland  oregon and berkeley  california 
through this transaction  we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year 
this includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth  and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies 
results of operations years ended december  and gross sales 
gross sales increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in wholesale beverage segment sales increased  or million  to million as a result of a increase in total beverage shipments to  barrels as well as an average price increase of for beer 
of the total beverage shipments  beer shipments increased by to  barrels in from  barrels in  primarily due to increased pyramid brand shipments 
pyramid brand shipments increased to  barrels for the year  driven by pyramid hefe weizen  our top selling product  which was 
table of contents up in shipment volumes for the year 
the increase in pyramid brand shipments was offset by declines in other non core beer brand shipments  which were down to  barrels due primarily to the discontinuation of certain product styles in the mactarnahan s and non core beer brands 
thomas kemper soda shipments were flat in  at  barrels  as compared to barrels shipped during alehouse sales of million decreased over a year ago  primarily due a decline in sales in the portland mactarnahan s taproom primarily due to reduced traffic resulting from inclement weather in the second and fourth quarters offset by single digit sales growth in our walnut creek location 
excise taxes 
excise taxes were and of gross beverage sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in increased to per beer barrel as compared to for the same period in federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments 
for the first  barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like pyramid is per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an per beer barrel rate 
state taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis 
the increase in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales is related primarily to the agreement reached with the ttb during the third quarter of note to the consolidated financial statements in which we agreed to pay  to resolve all issues arising from the audit  including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue  which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the portland brewing company for the period at issue due to portland brewing s waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments 
also contributing to the increase in excise taxes  we began paying federal excise taxes on beer produced at the portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at the facility at the per barrel rate 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment at more favorable prices  offset by the one time impact of the  ttb excise tax assessment recorded in  the effect of which was moderated by the fact that gross margin in benefited from a  gain on the sale of brewery equipment relating to the consolidation of production operations 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december   as compared to in the following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended december  and in thousands of of segment segment gross margin net sales net sales change change beverage segment alehouse segment total selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the additional expense was primarily attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses of million  to million  due primarily to executive transition costs of approximately  increases in professional fees of  related primarily to legal fees associated with the ttb excise tax audit  rent expense associated with the vacant seattle brewery of approximately  an increase in director and public company costs of  associated primarily with our compliance efforts with the sarbanes oxley act of  and increased consulting fees of  additionally  selling expenses for increased by  and totaled million  or of net beverage segment sales  compared to million  or of net beverage segment sales in marketing expense decreased  to million for the year ended december   from million in primarily due to decreases in package redesign costs as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits as a result of lower headcount 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  increased to  for the year ended december   from  in  primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with our capital lease agreement note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been established 
we will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
net loss 
we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million in the net loss in was positively impacted by the one time gain on the sale of brewery equipment of  relating to the consolidation of production operations in the third quarter of aside from that factor  the increase in net loss of  is primarily due to the ttb excise tax settlement during the third quarter of and an increase in general and administrative expenses  offset by the incremental sales due to the beverage sales volume and price increases 
years ended december  and gross sales 
gross sales increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in wholesale beverage segment sales increased  or million  to million as a result of a increase in total beverage shipments to  barrels 
strong craft beer category sales in key west coast markets contributed to increases in beer shipments of over the prior year 
pyramid brands accounted for of this increase with beer shipments of  barrels in  compared to  barrels in thomas kemper soda shipments increased across all flavors in  to  barrels  as compared to  barrels shipped during also contributing to the growth in sales was a full year of sales from the mactarnahan s brand family  acquired in the asset purchase agreement with portland brewing 
alehouse sales of million improved over a year ago primarily due to a full year of sales in for the mactarnahan s taproom  acquired in the asset purchase agreement with portland brewing 
excise taxes 
excise taxes were and of gross beverage sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in decreased to per barrel as compared to for the same period in federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments 
for the first  barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like pyramid is per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an per beer barrel rate 
state taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis 
the decrease in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales in is related to a greater portion of beverage sales to states with lower excise taxes and in which distributors pay the excise tax as well as contract brewing arrangements in which we incur lower costs 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to million in from million in the gross margin increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment and a corresponding decrease in per barrel costs  and a  gain on the sale of brewery equipment from consolidation of production operations 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december   as compared to in the following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended december  and in thousands of of segment segment gross margin net sales net sales change change beverage segment alehouse segment total selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the additional expense was primarily attributed to a million increase in selling and marketing expense for package redesign work released in the third quarter and an increase in the size of our sales force to support efforts to 
table of contents grow the pyramid brands 
selling and marketing expenses for the period ended december  totaled million and million  respectively  or and of net beverage sales  respectively  in comparison to million and million  respectively  or or  respectively for general and administrative expenses for the period ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to bonuses  executive stock based compensation  and professional and director fees 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased to expense of  for the year ended december   from income of  in  primarily due to an increase in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  in comparison to  for  largely due to the interest associated with the berkeley facility mortgage and the interest on borrowings under our line of credit  partially offset by sublease income of income taxes 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been established 
we will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
net loss 
we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million in the decrease in net loss of million was primarily due to the  gain realized on the sale of excess production equipment from the seattle brewery facility  as well as beverage sales volume increases  and the cost reduction initiatives relating to consolidating production operations  partially offset by increased freight costs and additional sales and marketing activities 
liquidity and capital resources we had a  balance of cash and cash equivalents and a million accounts receivable balance at december  at december   our working capital was negative at million compared to a negative  at december  our working capital was impacted negatively by executive transition costs  the excise tax settlement discussed below  as well as an increase in short term financing related to our capital lease keg financing agreement note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss of  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  in the increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflect the fact that we sold brewery equipment assets in which generated  in cash 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year was primarily due to payment to the ttb in connection with the excise tax settlement  no net payments or borrowings on the line of credit as of december  compared to  in cash paid in the prior year as well as a decrease of cash dividends paid 
in march  we renegotiated our line of credit agreement with first mutual bank which makes available through march   a million line of credit 
a portion of the line of credit   has been reserved to support the standby letter of credit for the keg lease agreement note to the consolidated financial statements 
any borrowings are subject to an interest rate of prime plus  fully floating  with a commitment fee 
under the terms of the agreement  we must limit capital expenditures to million and adhere to certain financial performance covenants with a restriction on the payment of future dividends 
the beverage segment operates with relatively short accounts receivable terms and the alehouse segment operates essentially as a cash business  as such we typically tend to collect within days of a sale or immediately upon sale 
therefore  we generally do not require significant cash on hand to meet operating needs 

table of contents we settled with the ttb in note to the consolidated financial statements and agreed to pay  to resolve all issues arising from the audit  including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue  which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the portland brewing company for the period at issue due to portland brewing s waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an initial payment of  and the remaining balance will be payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years  at a variable interest rate estimated at 
in january  we completed the sale of the tk soda assets to the kemper company  a new company formed by adventure funds  a portland based equity investment fund 
under terms of the transaction  we received million in cash for tk soda assets including the brand and intellectual property  soda kegs  vehicles and point of sale materials 
the transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which pyramid will continue to manufacture thomas kemper soda products for the kemper company at its breweries in portland  oregon and berkeley  california 
through this transaction  we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year 
this includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth  and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies in our breweries to reduce costs and improve margins 
we believe that our cash flow from operating activities  tighter management of capital spending and cash management in combination with various financing options  including the line of credit and capital asset leasing  should provide adequate working capital to meet our needs 
additionally  we believe that the cash provided from the sale of the tk soda assets will improve our liquidity by reducing our reliance on our line of credit during the seasonally slow first quarter of  while allowing us to make these capital investments 
however  it is possible that this cash infusion may be insufficient to meet our capital investment requirements  which would require us to seek additional capital from other sources  which may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all 
contractual obligations at december   our commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases capital leases note payable ttb excise tax assessment we have obligations in the form of revenue sharing provisions in certain alehouse lease agreements  based on the excess of the percentage of revenue over the minimum lease payment 
for the years ended december   and  there were no amounts owed under revenue sharing agreements 
in  we acquired  of new kegs under our capital lease agreement note to the consolidated financial statements for a total of million  payable over a month period 
the amounts are principal only payments as stated in securitized financing arrangement for the berkeley facility purchase 
in  we settled with the ttb  resolving all issues arising from the audit including the federal tax assessments for the period at issue note to the consolidated financial statements for a total amount of  payable in monthly installments for a period of three years 
in conjunction with the portland brewing asset purchase  we entered into a five year earn out agreement with portland brewing company which may result in additional payments to portland brewing based on sales of portland brewing brands during the earn out period through december  for the years ended december   and  there were no amounts owed under the earn out 

table of contents contingencies we concluded discussions with the ttb relating to the ttb s findings from its recently completed audit of the federal excise tax returns and operations of the company 
upon completion of the audit the ttb had concluded that a notwithstanding our contractual arrangements with portland brewing relating to the production of beer at our portland  oregon brewery facility  we not portland brewing were the legal brewer at that facility and b that federal excise taxes on beer production at the portland facility from january  through may  had been underpaid 
these contractual arrangements were originally premised on the understanding that they would result in portland brewing being deemed the legal brewer at the portland brewery facility  which would have resulted in lower federal excise tax costs on beer produced at that facility because portland brewing is a small brewer that pays excise taxes at a lower rate on the first  barrels it produces 
after we were notified of the ttb s conclusions from the audit  we engaged in discussions with the ttb regarding a compromise of the ttb s proposed assessment relating to our underpayment of excise taxes and explored with the ttb whether our commercial relationship with portland brewing could be modified so that in the future we met the ttb s requirements for a valid contract brewing arrangement 
as a result of our discussions with the ttb  we reached a settlement with the ttb that we would pay  to resolve all issues arising from the audit  including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue  which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by portland brewing for the period at issue due to portland brewing s waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments the settlement 
under the terms of the settlement  we were obligated to make an initial payment of  with the balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years  at an interest rate that is currently estimated to be approximately 
we recognized the  settlement as a charge to earnings for the quarter ended september  we anticipate that our current operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy the payment terms described above 
in addition  based on our discussions with the ttb  we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with portland brewing to comply with the ttb s interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that portland brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the portland brewery facility 
consequently  we elected to terminate the production agreement dated february  as amended july  between us and portland brewing the production agreement by written notice to portland brewing dated september  the termination of the production agreement was effective on november  in addition to the production agreement  certain related agreements between us and portland brewing will terminate per their respective terms when the production agreement terminates 
in june  sound beverages  a former distributor of ours  filed a suit in king county superior court against us 
the suit alleged that we had violated washington s wholesale distributor supplier equity act  rcw  by unreasonably withholding consent to the transfer of distribution rights to columbia distribution 
we contend that we were within our rights to reasonably withhold consent  and are contesting this matter including the  in damages claimed by sound beverages 
this matter is in the early stages of arbitration 
management believes that the ultimate outcome to us will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the matter discussed above  we are involved from time to time in claims  proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe that any such claims  proceedings or litigation  either alone or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies to prepare financial statements that conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  management must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our accounting estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
table of contents readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value 
we regularly review our inventories for the presence of excess and obsolete inventory using criteria such as age  quality  seasonal demand forecasts and branding changes  and write off or adjust the inventory to carrying value 
long lived assets impairment 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less the estimated costs to sell 
long lived assets are written down to their estimated net fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis in the event of an impairment 
if circumstances related to our long lived assets change  our valuation of the long lived assets could materially change 
goodwill impairment 
we review our goodwill  which relates entirely to our previous acquisition of thomas kemper soda  annually for impairment  or when events or changes in circumstances occur 
goodwill was classified as held for sale as of december   pending the sale of the thomas kemper soda brand  which occurred in january allowance for keg deposits 
we purchase kegs from vendors and record these assets in property  plant and equipment 
when the kegs are shipped to the distributors  a keg deposit is collected based on  among other things  the size of the keg and the destination point and is refunded to the distributors upon return of the kegs to us 
the keg deposit liability is recorded as a current liability 
on a periodic basis  typically annually  management is required to make certain estimates regarding the physical count of kegs in the marketplace  estimated loss of kegs  expectations regarding keg returns and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of keg deposit liabilities and keg assets in property  plant and equipment at the date of the financial statements 
actual keg deposit liability could differ from the estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the time of shipment  when the title of our products passes to the customer in accordance with distributor sales agreements and collectibility is probable 
we do not have standard terms that permit return of product 
the cost for product returns are recorded in cost of sales and revenue is reduced at the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is returned 
beverage segment revenues under the commercial arrangements with the portland brewing company were recorded on a gross basis pursuant to the guidance prescribed in emerging issues task force eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent as it was a principal in accordance with the indicators which include the following i being the primary obligor in the arrangement  ii having latitude in establishing price  iii having discretion in supplier selection  iv determination of product or service specifications  and v having credit risk 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input 
table of contents of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the options for only the portion of options expected to vest 
therefore  we applied an estimated forfeiture rate that we derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
additionally  the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available in us treasury securities at maturity with an equivalent term 
we have not provided for a dividend assumption in the black scholes valuation method for grants beginning in as we ceased paying any dividends in early and currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the future 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
realization of deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
the evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is based on existing deferred tax liabilities and an assessment of our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we record a valuation allowance to the extent that recovery is not likely 
if circumstances related to our ability to generate future us taxable income change  our evaluation of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could materially change 
promotional activities 
throughout the year  our sales force engages in promotional activities with our distributor and retail customers 
in connection with financial statement preparation and other financial reporting  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures resulting from these activities 
actual expenditures incurred could differ from management s estimates and assumptions 
if management s estimates and assumptions differ from the actual promotional activities incurred a timing difference could result either understating or overstating the actual promotional activity expense in a subsequent period 
because of the nature of promotional activities and the historical trends used in management analysis  management does not consider the potential timing differences to be a significant risk in the financial statement presentation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the fair value of all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options as well as compensatory employee stock purchase plans 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
which expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations 
in april  the sec issued a press release that amends the required adoption date of sfas no

in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  which states that a company may adopt a policy for presenting taxes on a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  the accounting policy should be disclosed  and if taxes are presented gross  the amounts included in revenue should be disclosed 
the consensus reached on this issue is effective for periods beginning after december  with early application permitted 
as our accounting policy is to present excise taxes on a gross basis as described in the eitf  our policy and disclosure presentation are already in accordance with eitf no
