item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
company overview atmi believes it is a leading supplier of high performance materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems used worldwide in the manufacture of microelectronic devices 
atmi targets both semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers  whose products form the foundation of microelectronics technology rapidly proliferating through the information technology  automotive  communication and consumer products industries 
the market for microelectronics devices is growing and continually changing  which drives demand for new products and technologies at lower cost 
atmi s objective is to meet the demands of microelectronic manufacturers with solutions that maximize the efficiency of their manufacturing processes and minimize the time to ramp new processes and deliver new products 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in the world who target leading edge technologies 
during  atmi significantly reduced its exposure to the capital equipment cycles of the semiconductor industry by selling non core product lines 
the non core product lines that we exited by sale included the following environmental abatement equipment  materials sensing and monitoring equipment  specialty thin film deposition services  outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services  our smartcard device venture and gallium nitride materials 
see note in item of this form k for additional details about the discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements  which we discuss under the heading results of operations following this section of our md a 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of non marketable equity securities  which impacts our determination of impairment  allowances for doubtful accounts  which impacts revenues  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impact our tax provision  depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  equity based compensation  and valuation of inventory  which impacts operating income 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales of equipment with acceptance criteria  however  these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon delivery to a common carrier when terms are fob origin and upon receipt by a customer when terms are fob destination 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we accrue for sales returns  warranty costs and other allowances based on a current 
table of contents evaluation of our experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
the company uses an exclusive contract manufacturer  which is also an exclusive distribution partner  for the manufacture and distribution of its sds products the licensed products 
under the terms of the manufacturing agreement  atmi retains the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products  while the contract manufacturer has the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products 
upon completion of manufacture  atmi purchases all licensed products produced by the contract manufacturer 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  we receive payment from the distributor based upon a formula which is dependent on the sale price obtained by the distributor to its customer 
atmi recognizes revenue from the sale of licensed products to this distribution partner when the distributor sells the licensed products to its customers  because that is when the sales price becomes fixed and determinable by the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of the specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing account balance reviews and agings of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended 
write offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks surrounding specific customers 
inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
we value inventories using the first in  first out fifo cost method 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and we write down the value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and excess quantities on hand and for known adverse conditions and circumstances 
each quarter  we make estimates of future demand by using the latest forecasts and known market conditions available to us 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
non marketable equity securities we selectively invest in non marketable equity securities of private companies  which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an atmi product or initiative 
at december   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities totaled million million in 
non marketable equity securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term assets 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  attracting and retaining talented professionals and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined 
table of contents milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
impairments of investments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities were approximately million in million in and million in 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits  deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that a substantial majority of the gross deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
for a discussion of current tax matters  see note in item of this form k 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate our property  plant and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the depreciation periods used are as follows buildings  to years  machinery and equipment  to years  furniture and fixtures  years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life 
atmi uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
we amortize our patents and other amortizable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
all amortizable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from to years 
equity based compensation effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r and related interpretations which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity based payments to employees and directors based on their fair value 
prior to  the company accounted for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 

table of contents apb  accounting for stock issued to employees as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  stock option expense was not recognized in net income as the exercise price of options granted was equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
the company provided pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts as if stock option expense had been recognized based on fair value in the footnotes  as required 
the company has elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of equity based compensation expense 
equity based compensation expense has been recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are expected to vest over the service period beginning on january  the company utilizes the black scholes merton options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options under sfas no 
r  consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures in prior years 
management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs  including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price ie  expected volatility and option exercise activity ie  expected term 
for awards granted subsequent to january   expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of atmi common stock for a period shorter than the expected term of the options 
we have excluded the historical volatility prior to the public announcement regarding the sale of our non core businesses in  because those businesses that were sold represented a significant portion of atmi s consolidated business and were subject to considerable cyclicality associated with the semiconductor equipment industry  which drove increased volatility in atmi s stock price 
the expected term of options granted is currently derived using the simplified method as allowed under the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
as of december   million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company presented tax benefits resulting from the equity based compensation as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be classified as financing cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  in the determination of equity based compensation cost  the company estimates the total number of instruments that will be forfeited as a result of a failure to provide the requisite service to earn the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  for purposes of the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 the company did not make an estimate of forfeitures  but instead subsequently reversed pro forma compensation cost for forfeited awards when the awards were actually forfeited 
the effect of forfeitures on restricted stock was not material in periods prior to january  equity based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the stated vesting period 
marketable securities we account for marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities as amended by fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp 
fsp provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes 
table of contents accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
all of the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale as of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
marketable securities that are in a temporarily impaired position  where management has the ability and intent to hold until anticipated recovery or maturity  are classified as either current or non current based on the remaining contractual maturity of the security 
those securities in a temporarily impaired position with contractual maturities greater than one year are classified as non current 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the company had million of goodwill also million in  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the fourth quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management s assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment as of december  future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  changes in the microelectronics industry  changes in technology  and the execution of management s plans 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill 
we review the carrying values of intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets or other assets may be impaired 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
an impairment review consists of a specific evaluation of the assets or groups of assets to determine whether any impairment exists  by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount 
if the review indicates that the asset is impaired  then an impairment loss representing the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying value is recognized

forward looking statements may be identified by words such as anticipate  plan  believe  seek  estimate  expect  could  and words of similar meanings and include  without limitation  statements about the expected future business and financial performance of atmi such as financial projections  expectations for demand and sales of new and existing products  customer and supplier relationships  research and development programs  market and technology opportunities  international trends  business strategies  business opportunities  objectives of management for future operations  microelectronic industry including wafer start growth  and trends in the markets in which the company participates 
forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which are inherently subject to uncertainties  risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict 
investors and others should consider the cautionary statements and risk factors discussed in item a above 
purchases of shares pursuant to the company s share repurchase programs may be subject to prevailing market prices for the company s common stock  availability of shares for public or private purchase  other market conditions  and alternative uses and applications for the company s cash that may arise from time to time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included money market securities  corporate and municipal bond obligations and commercial paper 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
approximately percent of the company s revenues for the year ended december  were denominated in japanese yen jpy  but the product is sourced in us dollars 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company currently utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain jpy exposures  but does not use any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   atmi had million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated assets  which will be settled in jpy 
holding other variables constant  if there were a percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates for the jpy  the fair market value of the contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million but would be expected to be offset by foreign exchange gains on the amounts being hedged 
the effect of an immediate percent change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
changes in market risk there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposure between the fiscal years ended december  and december
