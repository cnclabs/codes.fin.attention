item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
we also own and operate two television stations located in honolulu and new orleans 
in the quarter ended august   we classified our television assets as held for sale see note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
the results of operations of our television division have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
radio stations ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron inc because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties domestic radio revenue growth has been anemic for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of four factors lack of inventory and pricing discipline by radio operators  a more focused newspaper advertising sales force that has slowed the market share gains radio was making vis vis newspapers  the emergence of new media  such as internet advertising and cable interconnects  which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  and the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and mp players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising 
the radio industry has begun several initiatives to address these issues  most notable of which is the rollout of hd radio tm 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together to coordinate the programming on secondary channels in each radio market to ensure a more diverse consumer offering and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
we currently utilize hd radio digital technology on most of our fm stations and plan to complete the build out of hd radio capabilities at most of our remaining fm stations in fiscal it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 
arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the personal people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
to date  more than ten radio broadcasters  including emmis  have signed long term contracts to use the ppm service 
this service will begin in the new york market in the fall of  with the los angeles and chicago markets following in it is unclear what impact the introduction of the ppm will have on ratings in the markets in which we operate 
our three radio stations in new york trailed the performance of their peers during the year ended february  for the year ended february   our new york radio stations net revenues were down  whereas the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co  llp miller kaplan reported that net revenues of the new york market in total were down 
we believe we trailed the performance of our peers in new york principally due to turnover in key management positions at our new york stations and deterioration in ratings at each of our three radio stations 
we believe that we have solidified our management positions in new york  but ratings continue to be weak  which will continue to impair revenues in our upcoming fiscal year 
our two radio stations in los angeles have also trailed the performance of their peers during the year ended february  for the year ended february   our los angeles radio stations net revenues were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that net revenues of the los angeles market in total were down 
kpwr fm trailed the performance of its peers due to an increase in the number of competitors with similar formats 
this competition eroded kpwr fm s ratings and negatively impacted revenues 
recent ratings have improved for kpwr fm and revenues are beginning to rebound 
kmvn fm formerly kzla fm changed its format from country to rhythmic pop contemporary in august given the drastic nature of format differences  the company expected station ratings and revenues to be negatively affected immediately after the format switch  but expected ratings and revenues to rebound and eventually surpass those under the country format 
as of february   ratings and revenues results since the format change have not met the company s expectations 
we intend to invest additional resources in promoting the station in the next fiscal year and expect to see a recovery in ratings and revenues in the second half of fiscal emmis is in the process of divesting all its television stations 
the decision to sell its television stations stemmed from the company s desire to reduce its debt  coupled with the company s view that its television stations needed to be aligned with a company with more significant financial resources and a singular focus on american television challenges  including the growth of digital video recorders and the industry s relationship with cable and satellite providers 
as of february   emmis has sold fourteen of its sixteen television stations  receiving gross proceeds of approximately billion 
on february   emmis entered into an agreement to sell one of the remaining television stations  kgmb tv and its satellite stations 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar emmis expects to sell its remaining television station  wvue tv  in the next three to twelve months 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under sfas no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we typically engage an independent appraisal firm to value assets acquired in a material acquisition 
we use the appraisal report to help us allocate the purchase price of the acquisition among different categories of assets 
to the extent that purchased assets are not allocated appropriately  depreciation and amortization expense could be materially different 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
these estimates are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize experts in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of our tax expense and related liabilities 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and  respectively 
the decrease in accrued employee healthcare claims is mostly due to a smaller workforce as a result of our television station sales 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation claims  automotive liability losses and media liability 
valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company relies heavily upon historical data for its stock price when determining expected volatility  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 

table of contents acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired a national radio network in slovakia and a controlling interest in two national radio networks in bulgaria for an aggregate cash purchase price of million

our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  funding acquisitions and preferred stock dividend requirements 
we also have used  and may continue to use  capital to repurchase our common stock

see investing activities below for discussion of specific segment needs 
at february  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents mostly relates to million of cash invested as of february  resulting from television asset sales  which was used for the march  redemption of the remaining floating rate senior notes that were outstanding at february  the increase in net working capital primarily relates to increased working capital at our held for sale television stations mostly in relation to programming payments due at february  that were paid in fiscal  coupled with lower accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower current maturities of long term debt 
a significant portion of our cash balances at february  and million and million  respectively are held by our foreign entities

table of contents operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february   as compared to the same period in the prior year  is due to lower revenues in our new york and los angeles markets coupled with lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the settlement of corporate bonus and settlement payments related to the sale of the company s television stations 
additionally  since november  the company has sold two fm radio stations and fourteen of its sixteen television stations 
cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended february  compared to million in the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to cash received during the year ended february  from the sale of thirteen of the company s sixteen television stations 
investing activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have consummated numerous acquisitions and divestitures in the three years ended february  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as ancillary businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
conversely  as evidenced by the sale our television stations  kkfr fm in phoenix  and wrda fm in st 
louis  we continually evaluate our portfolio and we will monetize assets when others see greater value in selected assets than we do 
in the years ended february   and  we had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to hd radio technology 
we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and equipment upgrades in connection with our rollout of hd radio 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
emmis has entered into an agreement with ibiquity digital corporation to employ hd radio technology at nineteen of our radio stations by june  under the agreement  the company incurred approximately million and million to implement hd radio at fifteen of its stations during the years ended february  and  respectively 
the company expects to incur approximately million in fiscal to finish hd radio conversion of four fm stations in our austin market 
amounts related to our digital radio build out are included in contractual cash obligations under the heading purchase obligations 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributable to i lower net debt repayments for the year ended february  as the company had closed on of its television stations and made related debt principal repayments in the prior year  ii the million repurchase of class a common shares in the year ended february   partially offset by iii a million special dividend paid to holders of class a common shares in november our debt service requirements over the next twelve month period excluding interest under our credit facility and principal amounts of our senior subordinated notes are expected to be million 
this amount is comprised of million for repayment of term notes under our credit facility and million in preferred stock dividend requirements 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october at may   we had million available under our credit facility  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
the company expects to continue to use its significant cash flows from operations to primarily repay outstanding debt obligations 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as ancillary 
table of contents businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our minority partner s entire interest in six radio stations in austin  tx after a period of approximately five years from the acquisition date based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
intangibles including intangible assets classified as noncurrent assets discontinued operations  at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
our foreign broadcasting licenses expire during periods ranging from november to may we will need to submit applications to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
 which permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt sfas no 
no later than march  the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
and its effect  if any  on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
 which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for more information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for the company as of march  the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
and its effect  if any  on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  that eliminates the acceptability of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this fsp is effective for the company as of march  and requires retrospective restatement of prior period results 
early adoption of this pronouncement is precluded for the company 
the company had been accruing for planned major maintenance activities associated with a leased airplane under the accrue in advance method 
the company had accrued for approximately million of airplane maintenance costs that will be retroactively restated upon adoption of this fsp 
upon adoption on march   the company will account for planned major maintenance activities using the deferral method as provided for in the fsp 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
 that provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under fin no 
 financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and is effective for the company as of march  the cumulative impact of this guidance is expected to result in a decrease to noncurrent tax liabilities of approximately million to million with a corresponding offset to accumulated deficit upon adoption on march  seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending 
table of contents across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since the senior bank debt is  at february   entirely comprised of floating rate debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure  emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our credit facility bore interest at variable rates 
beginning in may  the credit facility requires emmis to maintain fixed interest rates  for at least a three year period  on a minimum of of emmis total outstanding debt  as defined by the credit facility 
on march   emmis entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the underlying three month libor at 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement totaled million  and the agreement expires on march  based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt were to increase by  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million 
with the interest rate swap agreement above  a increase would result in million of increased interest expense 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge against currency fluctuations between the forint and the us dollar since most of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis owns a network of radio stations in belgium  which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements  and its investment to date is approximately million 
these subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currency euro 
emmis owns and operates a national radio network in slovakia  which was acquired in march this subsidiary is measured in its local currency koruna 
emmis owns an approximate controlling interest in two national radio networks in bulgaria  which were acquired in november and december these subsidiaries are measured in their local currency leva 
emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period forint to dollar  euro to dollar  koruna to dollar  or leva to dollar exchange rates for calendar a devaluation of these foreign currencies could have a material effect on our financial statements taken as a whole 
at february   the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding  excluding intercompany loans 
the hungarian subsidiary repaid million of us dollar denominated loans during fiscal in the company s fiscal quarter ended february   it was determined that certain loans to our owned hungarian subsidiary were no longer deemed to be permanently invested 
as of february   these intercompany loans total million 
the company began recording foreign currency gains and losses related to these loans in its fiscal quarter ended february  and will continue to record foreign currency gains and losses until the loans are fully repaid 
the belgium  bulgarian and slovakian operations had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during the years ended february  or all of our cash balances held at our foreign entities are denominated in their respective local currencies 
emmis currently does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
