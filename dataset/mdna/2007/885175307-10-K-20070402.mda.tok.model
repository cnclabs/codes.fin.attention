item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k  including the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report  includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements can be identified by the words expects  projects  hopes  believes  intends  should  estimate  will  would  may  anticipates  plans  could and other similar words 
actual results  events or performance could differ materially from these forward looking statements based on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
therefore  readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these statements 
factors that could cause actual results or conditions to differ from those anticipated by these and other forward looking statements include those more fully described in the risk factors section of this annual report and in other documents we file with the sec 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
review of historic equity based compensation practices this annual report on form k for our fiscal year ended december  has been filed late because of a detailed review of our equity based compensation practices  including a review of the underlying documentation and procedures  and related accounting for  such practices 
the review was initiated as part of a series of standard testing procedures necessary in order to complete the preparation of our consolidated financial statements contained herein 
this review was completed on march  although this review identified certain documentation and procedural errors that resulted in unrecorded  non cash equity based compensation charges associated with certain of our past stock option grants  we have concluded that these accounting errors are immaterial to our financial statements in each of the periods to which the charges would have related fiscal years through 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of circulatory support products for use by patients with hf 
our vad s are used primarily by hf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart 
we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation  and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons and hf cardiologists worldwide  position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding hf market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary itc  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems and incision products that provide fast  accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
on october   itc acquired avox  a leading manufacturer of point of care instruments and disposables to perform co oximetry system testing 
our business model our business is comprised of two segments cardiovascular and itc 
the product line of our cardiovascular segment is circulatory support products 
our circulatory support products include vads for the short  intermediate and long term treatment of advanced hf 
in addition  we have developed small diameter grafts using our proprietary materials to address the vascular access market for hemodialysis 
the product lines of our itc segment are point of care diagnostics 
our point of care products include diagnostic test systems that monitor blood coagulation for a patient while being administered certain anticoagulants  blood gas electrolyte  oxygenation and chemistry status  including total hemoglobin 
incision 
our incision products include devices used to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing and screening for platelet function 
acquisitions on october   itc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of privately held avox based in san antonio  texas 
avox is now a subsidiary of itc and manufactures two devices that utilize patented light scattering technology to make direct measurements in whole blood 
the avoximeter e is specifically designed for the cardiac catheterization lab  and is the leading stand alone point of care co oximetry system in us hospitals today 
the portable avoximeter provides an assessment of a patient s oxygenation at the bedside 
the avoximeter is used in routine testing in combination with a blood gas analyzer to provide a more comprehensive and complete assessment of a patient s oxygenation status in the icu  operating room and other critical care situations 
it is also used in the nicu to confirm nitric oxide treatment side effects in newborns and in the emergency department to diagnose smoke inhalation 

table of contents the final purchase price allocation for our acquisition of avox is subject to the finalization of the valuation of certain assets and liabilities  plans for consolidation of facilities and relocation of employees and other integration activities 
the total purchase price of our acquisition of avox has been allocated to the assets and liabilities  based upon estimated fair value as determined primarily by an independent valuation firm 
we paid million in cash plus million of transaction costs 
as part of the acquisition  we expensed million  primarily comprising of in process research and development costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to  these policies and estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies and estimates  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc business segments when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
one of our distributors has certain limited product return rights 
other distributors have certain rights of return upon termination of their distribution agreement 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for these customers applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon historical experience 
no other direct sales customers or distributors have return rights or price protection 
we recognize sales of certain cardiovascular segment products to first time customers when we have determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
the amount of revenue under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on behalf of the company by third party providers 
the amount of product sales allocated to the cardiovascular segment products is made on a fair value basis 
under this basis  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the cardiovascular segment products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair values of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets could be significantly different and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales and training services 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for anticipated tax audit adjustments by united states  federal  state and local  as well as foreign  tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
management must make judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if any of these management estimates proves incorrect  our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
determining our deferred tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the assessment of our domestic and foreign operations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax liabilities in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is not likely  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we estimate will ultimately not be recoverable 
we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there occur a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not likely 
evaluation of purchased intangibles and goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows and the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheets could become significantly impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we complete an impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to amortization as required by sfas no 
upon completion of our impairment tests as of the end of fiscal year  we determined that neither goodwill nor intangible assets were impaired 
valuation of share based awards we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants is based on historical volatility 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
make whole premium under the terms of our senior subordinated convertible notes issued in  if we experience a change in control or a termination of trading of our common stock  each note holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to the issue price plus any original issue discount 
in addition  if the consideration for the change in control is all cash  the company will pay a make whole premium to the note holders 
this premium is considered an embedded derivative under sfas no 
and has been bifurcated from the convertible notes and recorded at its estimated fair value  million  million and none at december   december   and january   respectively 
there are significant variables and assumptions used in valuing the make whole provision of our senior subordinated convertible notes including  but not limited to  the company s stock price  volatility of the company s stock  the probability of our being acquired and the probability of the type of consideration used by a potential acquirer 
if any of these variables change significantly or if any of management s assumptions proves incorrect  our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected

research and development costs also include regulatory and clinical costs associated with our compliance with fda regulations and clinical trials such as the phase ii heartmate ii pivotal trial 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase is attributable to higher amortization of intangible costs from the acquisition of avox and a change in business conditions that caused us to modify the remaining economic useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets under sfas no

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non deductible share based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we believe we have provided adequate amounts for anticipated tax audit adjustments in the us  state and other foreign tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts are unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

table of contents accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment  an amendment of sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that share based compensation be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and these cost be measured based on the fair value of the share based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  effective with fiscal years beginning after december  and only affecting the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle or error correction is made 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle or correction of an error to retrospective application 
retrospective application means the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
we adopted this sfas in in november  the fasb issued staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp provides additional guidance on when an investment in a debt or equity security should be considered impaired and when that impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
the fsp also requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
companies are required to apply the guidance in this fsp to reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this fsp in in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of the tax position if that position will more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance related to derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
we are currently evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of fin in order to determine the impact that this guidance will have on our results of operations or financial condition when we adopt fin at the beginning of our fiscal year in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
we are currently evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements that this guidance will have on our results of operations or financial condition when we adopt sfas no 
at the beginning of our fiscal year in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
on quantifying financial statement errors 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab no 
expresses the views of the sec staff in evaluating misstatements in financial statements to determine whether financial statement restatements are necessary 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we have determined that sab no 
will not have a material impact on the reported results of our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
all investments mature within two years or less from the date of purchase  except some of the investments in us treasuries that are held as restricted investments as collateral for future interest payments related to our senior subordinated convertible debt  which mature within three years from the original date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be nominal 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our senior subordinated convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our ventricular assist products who report to our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of that group 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the period end exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income 
the period end translation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our united kingdom uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds at the period end exchange rates result in foreign currency gains and losses  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations in interest income and other 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds 
our contracts typically have maturities of three months or less 
our financial instrument contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities and we value these contracts at the estimated fair value at december  the fair value of the forward currency contracts are included in interest income and other  and typically offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the statement of operations 
the impact of these foreign currency contracts was a loss of million and a gain of million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the impact of the foreign currency translation adjustments from conducting our foreign operations was a gain of million and a loss of million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
at december   we had forward contracts to sell euros with a notional value of million and purchase uk pounds with a notional value of million and at december   we had forward contracts to purchase euros with a notional value of million 
as of december   our forward contracts had an average exchange rate of one us dollar to euros and one us dollar to uk pounds 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately million
