risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of march   we offered brands of new vehicles through franchises in stores in the western united states and over the internet 
as of december  we operated stores in oregon  in california  in texas  in washington  in iowa  in idaho  in colorado  in alaska  in montana  in nevada  in nebraska  in south dakota  in north dakota  in new mexico and in wisconsin 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sell replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrange related financing  service contracts  protection products and credit insurance for our automotive customers 
we currently achieve gross profit margins above industry averages by selling a higher ratio of retail used vehicles to new vehicles and by arranging finance and extended warranty contracts for a greater percentage of our customers 
our acquisition model is focused on acquiring new vehicle stores where the store is the only franchise of that brand in the market 
our goal is to improve the operations of all four departments of every store we acquire 
we have had success with this strategy since our initial public offering in since  our ability to integrate and improve the stores that we acquire has increased dramatically 
we have also developed a better process for identifying acquisition targets that fit our operating model 
our cash position  substantial lines of credit  plus an experienced and well trained staff are all available to facilitate our continued growth as the opportunities develop 
in keeping with this model  we acquired stores in and in the first two months of combined with total estimated annual revenues of approximately million 
at december   we had stores held for sale and listed as discontinued operations with combined revenues of approximately million 
manufacturer incentives were generally lower and less effective in than in however  we expect that manufacturers will continue to offer incentives on new vehicle sales during through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  lease programs  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
to complement the manufacturers incentive strategy  we employ a volume based strategy for our new vehicle sales 
we are currently working on several initiatives that we expect will improve our operations in future periods 
such initiatives include the following a customer centric sales process  which will help leverage the benefits of our lithia store management system lsms which allows us to track advertising and increase the productivity of the sales staff by providing daily work plans and focused training 
under this program  showrooms will have interactive personal computers  which will allow the salesperson to quickly and efficiently enter data and interact with the customer to speed up the sales process  a finance and insurance f i certification program for our f i managers  improved functionality of our centralized inventory control and procurement process  an internet initiative  which involves developing a centralized department that will be staffed with brand specialists capable of communicating with customers by phone or live chat  it initiatives related to automating our offices  centralizing certain office functions and establishing independent used vehicle operations  an assured used vehicle program and an independent used vehicle strategy 
we began the assured used vehicle program in the tri cities  abilene and reno markets during the second quarter of we expect to have our first independent used vehicle outlet operating by late summer of  and used vehicle first look technology has been fully integrated across the entire network of stores 
we continue to train and optimize the usage of this technology in our stores 
the first look technology provides a trade analyzer  inventory management center  purchasing center  redistribution center and other functions that will help improve our used vehicle operations over time

we believe that our strong operating systems  integrated store network and regional market focus contributed to our same store sales increase  especially in the new vehicle sales 
during  we focused on new vehicle sales to gain market share and create long term parts and services business  which resulted in a increase in same store new vehicle retail sales in compared to and compared to an approximately decrease in the industry during the same period 
these industry figures include a large number of fleet sales  so industry retail figures were down substantially more 
improvements in same store used vehicle sales were minor as a result of the heightened focus on new vehicle sales in the year 
the increases in unit sales are also benefiting our parts and service business 
the improvements in finance and insurance same store sales resulted primarily from the unit increases in sales of both new and used vehicles during compared to the increase in compared to was primarily a result of acquisitions and a increase in same store sales  which was driven by an increase in units sold 
the increase in same store sales was driven by same store sales increases across all business lines 
the employee pricing programs offered by the domestic manufacturers during the second and third quarters of  as well as a mix shift away from trucks and suvs  resulted in a decrease in average selling prices but an increase in new units sold  the combination of which resulted in higher same store new vehicle sales 
the same programs also contributed to improvements in same store used vehicle sales due to the large number of good quality used vehicle trade ins associated with the high volume of new vehicle purchases 
the improvement in same store service  body and parts revenue in compared to was a result of our continued focus on service advisor training and our lifetime oil program 
in addition  pricing and cost saving initiatives across the service  body and parts business lines contributed to the improvement in compared to same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows compared to compared to new vehicle retail  excluding fleet used vehicle  including wholesale total vehicle sales  excluding fleet finance and insurance service  body and parts total sales  excluding fleet same store sales are calculated for stores that were operation as of december   and only including the months of operations for both comparable periods 
for example  a store acquired in june would be included in same store operating data beginning in july  after its first full complete comparable month of operation 
thus  operating results for same store comparisons would include only the periods of july through december of both comparable years 
fleet and other sales include both fleet sales and fees received for delivering vehicles on behalf of the manufacturer  the us military  rent a car companies or leasing companies 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter the decrease in the finance and insurance penetration rate in compared to was due to reduced availability of manufacturer subsidized low interest rate loans during the second and third quarters of when the manufacturers offered their employee pricing programs 
gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due primarily to increased total revenues 
an increase in the overall gross profit margin also contributed to the increase in compared to gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall bp stands for basis points one hundred basis points equals one percent 
the decrease in new vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to our focus on selling volume and gaining market share in our historical average gross profit margin achieved on new vehicles over the past five years was 
the decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to a comparison to unusually high gross margins achieved in  which resulted primarily from a healthy supply of good quality trade ins during the employee pricing programs 
our historical average gross profit margin achieved on retail used vehicles over the past five years was 
the decrease in wholesale used vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to wholesale market conditions  a focus on retailing more used vehicles and bringing in trade ins nearer to true market value 
our ability to provide customers with a better value for their trade ins  bringing them in closer to their true market value  has been improved by our use of the first look technology 
this  however  lowers the gross profit margin we are able to achieve on the re sale of these trade ins 
in addition  as we focus on retailing more used vehicles  we are left with the lower quality used vehicles for wholesaling  which also contributed to lower gross profit margins 
we dispose of our wholesale used vehicles by using centralized controls  holding our own local used vehicle auctions and managing the disposal of units at larger third party auctions 
the increases in service  body and parts gross profit margin in compared to and in compared to were due to our continued focus on service advisor training  which has led to gains in the sale of higher margin service items and increases in customer pay business  as well as a number of pricing and cost saving initiatives 
higher penetration rates for our lifetime oil change and filter service also contributed to these gross profit margin increases 
in addition to the reasons discussed above  the decline in the overall gross profit margin during compared to was also due to our focus on increased new vehicle sales  which carry a lower margin than the other business lines 
in the new vehicle business  margins remained relatively constant in compared to as a result of strategic initiatives and internal directives in and early that increased gross profit per vehicle sold 
these margin raising initiatives were partially offset in by manufacturers employee pricing programs  which created a higher volume  lower margin environment during the second and third quarters of retail used vehicle margins improved in compared to as a result of a stronger pricing and retail environment for used vehicles in combination with a large quantity of good quality used vehicle trade ins 
margins in our wholesale used vehicle business declined in compared to as a result of aggressive wholesaling in the third and fourth quarters of designed to clear inventories going into the seasonally slower winter months 
gross profits per unit remained positive 
same store gross profit increased in compared to and increased in compared to  mainly due to increases in same store revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
sg a increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to sg a as a percentage of revenue increased by basis points in compared to and decreased by basis points in compared to the increases in dollars spent in compared to and in compared to were due primarily to increased selling  or variable  expenses related to the increases in acquisition revenues and the number of locations 
approximately million and million of the increase in sg a was due to these factors in compared to and in compared to  respectively 
in addition  stock based compensation included in sg a increased to million in compared to in and  in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r in january after salaries and wages  the next four largest expense categories  sales compensation  payroll taxes  rent and advertising  all improved or were flat as a percentage of gross profit in compared to sg a in also included expenses for certain initiatives that we expect will lead to operating efficiencies in future periods as discussed in overview above 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit is an industry standard and a better gauge for measuring performance relative to sg a expense 
as a result of the charges related to our operating initiatives and the other charges detailed above  sg a as a percentage of gross profit increased by basis points in compared to the change in stock based compensation and the charge for the worker s compensation claim resulted in a basis point increase out of the basis point total increase 
we expect to continue to incur charges in related to our operating initiatives and also expect our health and benefit plan costs to increase materially in compared to sg a as a percentage of gross profit improved by basis points in compared to as we continued to realize the positive results of multiple cost saving initiatives at our corporate headquarters and in the stores 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million and million  respectively  in compared to and in compared to due to the addition of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisitions  as well as leasehold improvements to existing facilities 
income from operations operating margins decreased by basis points to in compared to in  due to the decrease in overall gross profit margin and the increase in sg a as discussed above 
operating margins improved by basis points in compared to in  primarily due to improved overall gross profit margin as discussed above 
in addition  in  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by basis points compared to floorplan interest expense floorplan interest expense increased million in compared to an increase of million resulted from increases in the average interest rates on our floorplan facilities  an increase of million resulted from increases in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities and an increase of million related to our interest rate swaps 
floorplan interest expense increased million in compared to an increase of million resulted from increases in the average interest rates on our floorplan facilities and an increase of million resulted from increases in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to our interest rate swaps 
other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on our senior subordinated convertible notes  debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages  our used vehicle line of credit and equipment related notes 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to increased other interest expense by approximately million and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
interest expense related to the million of senior subordinated convertible notes that were issued in may totals approximately  per quarter  which consists of  of contractual interest and  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to increased other interest expense by approximately million and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
other interest expense excludes million  million and million  respectively  of capitalized interest in  and income tax expense our effective tax rate was in  in and in our federal income tax rate is and our state income tax rate is currently  which varies with the mix of states where our stores are located 
we also have certain non deductible expenses and other adjustments that increased our effective rate at for to 
our effective tax rate may be affected in the future by the mix of asset acquisitions compared to corporate acquisitions  as well as by the mix of states where our stores are located 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was due primarily to an increase in revenue in some of our higher tax rate states 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in compared to as a result of the decreased overall gross profit margin  increased sg a and increased interest expense as discussed above 
income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to as a result of improvements in gross profit margins and operating expenses as discussed above 
discontinued operations we continually monitor the performance of each of our dealerships and make determinations to sell based primarily on return on capital criteria 
when a dealership meets the criteria of held for sale  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations are reclassified into discontinued operations 
all dealerships included in discontinued operations have been  or will be  eliminated from our on going operations upon completion of the sale 
we anticipate the completion of the sale for each dealership to occur within months from the date of determination 
during  we disposed of two of our dealerships that were held for sale at december  and  at december   two dealerships were held for sale 
certain financial information related to discontinued operations was as follows in thousands year ended december  revenue pre tax loss gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax amount of goodwill and other intangible assets disposed of interest expense is allocated to stores classified as discontinued operations for actual flooring interest expense directly related to the new vehicles in the store 
interest expense related to our used vehicle line of credit is allocated based on total used vehicle inventory of the store  and interest expense related to our equipment line of credit is allocated based on the amount of fixed assets

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
acquisitions have also been a contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital and the funding of our cash dividend payments 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses  capital requirements  projected acquisitions and current level of cash dividends for at least the next months from december  our inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  we slowed ordering vehicles in the third and fourth quarters of and worked to sell down our new vehicle inventory 
as a result  our days supply of new vehicles at december  was days below our average historical december balances and more than days below our december  levels 
in addition  by the end of january  we had reduced our new vehicles inventory by another days  which positioned us well going into the remainder of our focus on new vehicle unit sales in led to more trade ins  which resulted in increased used vehicle inventories 
as a result  our days supply of used vehicles at december  was days above average levels for december our new and used flooring notes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  new vehicles are financed at approximately and used vehicles are financed at approximately of cost 
used vehicles are financed as needed  utilizing our used vehicle flooring credit facility 
our board of directors declared dividends of per share on our class a and class b common stock  which were paid in march and may of  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  our board of directors approved an increase in our dividend to per share for both the second and third quarters  which totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
a dividend of per share was also paid on our class a and class b common stock in january for the fourth quarter of  which totaled million 
we anticipate recommending to the board of directors the approval of a cash dividend each quarter 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through december   we have purchased a total of  shares under this program  of which  were purchased during we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
the recent change in the tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders 
as a result  we believe it is now advantageous to shareholders to have a dividend in place 
with the dividend  we are able to offer an immediate and tangible return to our shareholders without reducing our already limited market float  which occurs when we repurchase shares 
however  when we believe that repurchases present an attractive use of our capital  we would expect to make strategic repurchases 
we have a working capital  acquisition and used vehicle flooring credit facility with us bank national association  daimlerchrysler financial services americas llc dcfs and toyota motor credit corporation tmcc  totaling up to million  which expires august  loans are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and are secured by new vehicle inventory  used vehicle and parts inventory  equipment other than fixtures  deposit accounts  accounts receivable  investment property and other intangible personal property 
stock and other equity interests of our subsidiary dealerships and certain other subsidiaries are excluded 
the lenders security interest in new vehicle inventory is subordinated to the interests of floorplan financing lenders  including dcfs and tmcc 
the agreement for this facility provides for events of default that include nonpayment  breach of covenants  a change of control and certain cross defaults with other indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the agreement provides that the lenders may declare the entire principal balance immediately due  foreclose on collateral and increase the applicable interest rate to the revolving loan rate plus percent  among other remedies 
the facility agreement includes financial and restrictive covenants typical of such agreements 
financial covenants include requirements to maintain a minimum total net worth and imposes minimum current ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and cash flow leverage ratio requirements 
the covenants restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  making investments  selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and restrictive covenants 
in addition  cash dividends are limited to million per fiscal year and repurchases by us of our common stock are limited to million per fiscal year 
ford motor credit  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  volkswagen credit and bmw financial services na  llc have agreed to floor all of our new vehicles for their respective brands with daimlerchrysler financial services americas llc and toyota motor credit corporation serving as the primary lenders for substantially all other brands 
these new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant brands 
vehicles financed by lenders not directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable non trade and are included as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows 
vehicles financed by lenders directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable and are included as an operating activity 
on november   general motors gm completed the sale of a majority equity stake in gmac to an investment consortium 
although gmac will continue to be the exclusive provider of gm financial products and services and continues to have the relationships with gm  a majority equity stake in gmac has been sold to an independent third party and gm has indicated in its public filings that it no longer controls the gmac entity 
as a result  we will be treating new vehicles financed by gmac after the change in ownership control as floorplan notes payable non trade and related changes as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows 
vehicles financed prior to this change in control will continue to be classified as floorplan notes payable trade  with related changes reflected as operating activities in our statements of cash flows  since these gmac vehicle financings occurred while gm retained control of gmac as its captive finance subsidiary 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants for all of our debt agreements in the foreseeable future 
in the event that we are unable to meet such requirements  and any available cure period has passed  the lender may require an acceleration of payment  increase the interest rate or limit our ability to borrow or pay cash dividends 
interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december   together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at december  remaining availability as of december  new and program vehicle lines working capital  acquisition and used vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
reduced by  for outstanding letters of credit 
we also have outstanding million of senior subordinated convertible notes due we will also pay contingent interest on the notes during any six month interest period beginning may   in which the trading price of the notes for a specified period of time equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at a price of per share upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events as follows if  prior to may   and during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  if  after may   the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  if  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon certain specified corporate events 
a declaration and payment of a dividend in excess of per share per quarter will result in an adjustment in the conversion rate for the notes if such cumulative adjustment exceeds of the current conversion rate 
we declared dividends of per share for the quarters ended june  september and december  and dividends of per share for each of the four preceding quarters 
effective january   we exceeded the threshold required for a change in the conversion rate 
with this change  the conversion rate per  of notes increased to from 
the notes are redeemable at our option beginning may  at the redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase all or some of the notes on may  and upon certain events constituting a fundamental change or a termination of trading 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for  or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration that is not all  or substantially all  common stock that is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event  will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange 
a termination of trading will have occurred if our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq national market 
our earnings to fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the senior subordinated convertible notes  was for the quarter ended december contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond floorplan notes lines of credit and long term debt interest on scheduled debt payments capital commitments operating leases we had capital commitments of million at december  for the construction of nine new facilities and additions to two existing facilities 
of the new facilities  five are replacing existing facilities 
we have already incurred million for these projects and anticipate incurring an additional million in and million in we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
we also had capital commitments of million for the acquisition and development of hardware and software for several information technology initiatives 
we anticipate incurring these amounts during in addition to the above  we have approximately million in planned capital expenditures under consideration for various new facilities and remodeling projects 
these projects are still in the planning stage or are awaiting approvals from governmental agencies or manufacturers 
we feel that these projects are a critical part of our future growth strategy 
we have also recorded a reserve for our estimated contractual obligations related to potential charge backs for vehicle service contracts  lifetime oil change contracts and other various insurance contracts that are terminated early by the customer 
at december   this reserve totaled million 
based on past experience  we estimate that the million will be paid out as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition  workers compensation insurance premium accrual  discretionary employee bonus accrual  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  and used vehicle inventory valuations 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and other revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
service contract and lifetime oil change contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with estimated lives of the applicable contracts 
if future cancellations are different than expected based on historical experience  we could have additional expense or income related to the cancellations in future periods 
at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which would be recognized as income upon receipt 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a three year retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual claims can be something greater or less than the historical experience  which could create our estimated liability to either be under or over accrued 
as of december  and  the accrual for insurance premiums was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
discretionary employee bonus accrual we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment  and the level thereof  of the annual bonus criteria under our discretionary support services bonus program in order to record bonus expense on a quarterly basis 
we accrue the estimated year end expense on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on bonus attainment expectations 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration the historical seasonality of our business and current trends 
if actual year end results differ materially from our estimates  the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated 
the bonus accrual at the end of any given year is accurate and reflective of actual results attained and amounts to be paid 
intangible assets we review our goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test using discounted estimated cash flows 
discounted future cash flows are prepared by applying a growth rate to historical revenues 
growth rates are calculated individually for each region with data derived from the us census bureau on population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from a hybrid capital asset pricing model which factors in an equity risk premium and a risk free rate  combined with a weighted average cost of capital model 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review 
our other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the franchise value of the business unit  which is considered to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization  but rather is included in the fair value based testing 
impairment could occur if the operating business unit book value is greater than the determined fair value 
at such point  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value 
we have determined that we operate as one business unit 
during and  we concluded that there was no impairment to the carrying value of our intangible assets 
at december  and  goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
we select a sampling of dealerships throughout the year to perform quarterly testing of book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guidelines 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory carrying values 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
if the book value of our used vehicles is actually more than fair value  we could experience lower gross margins on our used vehicles in future periods 
service work performed for vehicles in inventory many of our vehicles currently in inventory include a mark up for gross profit due to service work performed on those vehicles 
the service work performed includes charges to recondition used vehicles  accessories added to the vehicles and work performed to ready the vehicle for sale 
we defer an estimate of the gross profit on vehicles in inventory based on a historical analysis of actual charges to inventory 
at december  and  the estimate of deferred gross profit was million and million  respectively 
if the actual gross profit on an individual vehicle is more or less than the estimated deferred amount  we could potentially have deferred an amount different than the actual service work performed 
any differences in estimates compared to actual would be reflected in the gross margins in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
based on open market trades  we determined that our million of long term convertible fixed interest rate debt had a fair market value of approximately million at december  in addition  at december   we had million of other long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between october and may based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  and effective june  a ten year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts are recorded as a component of floorplan interest expense 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation results in a monthly settlement which is also recorded as a component of floorplan interest expense 
additional interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of changing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january  was approximately million  million and million  respectively  in  and interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt increased during  and by approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a result of increasing interest rates during those periods 
as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
based on current interest rates  we expect that our interest rate swaps will result in interest savings of approximately million in risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
