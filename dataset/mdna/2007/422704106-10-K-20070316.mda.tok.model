item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including the volatility of metals prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  and speculation and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  including speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  and political and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties

hedging activities could expose us to losses 
we periodically enter into hedging activities  such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the metals prices received on our products and in an attempt to insulate our operating results from declines in those prices 
however  hedging may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity 
our costs are subject to currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in world markets in united states dollars  although a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies  primarily the venezuelan bol var 
foreign exchange fluctuations may materially increase our production costs  future exploration activities and costs of capital 
for more specific information with regard to foreign currency as it relates to our operations in venezuela  see la camorra segment in md a 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities such as fuel  steel and cement 
the recent prices for such commodities have significantly increased and have increased our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in md a 
failure to comply with debt covenants could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement that includes various covenants and other limitations related to our indebtedness and investments that require us to maintain customary measures of financial performance 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit agreement and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe we will be able to comply with such requirements in the future  although failure to do so could adversely affect our results or financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  
table of contents future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  including long lived assets and investments  reserves for contingencies and litigation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting estimates in md a  note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise and our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
operation  development and exploration risks our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we currently conduct significant mining operations and exploration projects in venezuela and mexico 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct significant operations in these and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export or sale restrictions  expropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits  or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  recurring tax audits and delays in processing tax credits or refunds  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information regarding our operations in mexico and venezuela  see md a  item property descriptions and other various risk factors relating to our foreign operations 

table of contents political  social and regulatory change in venezuela may adversely affect us 
the success of our la camorra unit is dependent on the political  social and regulatory stability of venezuela 
we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully 
however  we face continued uncertainty in venezuela relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  exportation and exchange controls  and the possible effects of all of these uncertainties on our operations 
risks due to changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  industry nationalization  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations and the impact on commodities necessary to operate  mean there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
any such factors or occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
specifically  we are currently subject to the following business risks in venezuela  which are discussed in more detail in md a in january  the venezuelan government announced its intentions to nationalize certain strategic sectors  including petroleum and communications  now owned by private entities 
there has been no announced determination that the mining industry in venezuela will be considered for nationalization  however  there can be no assurance that our operations in venezuela will not be affected by the actions of the government in this capacity 
a fixed exchange rate of venezuelan currency with the us dollar  which has impacted our costs and operating cash flows 
a recently enacted criminal exchange law imposes strict sanctions  both criminal and economic  for currency exchanges outside the officially designated methods or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
effective january   we will implement a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bol var  the local currency in venezuela 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the venezuelan government announced its intention to rescind inactive  non compliant mining concessions and created a state agency that is responsible for exploration  exploitation  processing and industrialization of gold and other minerals in venezuela 
venezuela has had high levels of inflation in the recent past 
continued or increased inflation there could increase the prices we pay for products and services  including wages for our employees 
movement of cash from venezuela  at the official exchange rate  is regulated by the criminal exchange act 
we are able to repatriate cash to the us  however  in doing so we must utilize specific government programs that have been limited or slow  or utilize negotiable instruments on which we have incurred losses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate  including the lucky friday level expansion and development of mina isidora in venezuela 
if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of production of metals partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  
table of contents facility and equipment costs  availability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  currency exchange and repatriation risks  applicable tax rates  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  political risks and regulatory climate in the foreign countries in which we operate  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual cash operating costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates as a result of which it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates  particularly those for properties that have not yet started producing  may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our operating and non operating properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
we may use forward sales contracts and other hedging techniques to partially offset the effects of a drop in the market prices of the metals we mine 
however  if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  and write downs of asset values 

table of contents efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration program 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often nonproductive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
it is possible we will enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties  similar to our joint venture arrangements related to the greens creek unit 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
for further information  please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our investors  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  an inability to obtain financing and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for new properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive new mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
our business depends on good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel  including those residing outside of the us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable in mining operations 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
our ability to manage our costs at our la camorra unit in venezuela depends in part upon the success of our plans to reduce the workforce by approximately workers through voluntary termination incentives in  at a cost of approximately million  and to retain a remaining workforce that will maintain a satisfactory level of production and cost performance 

table of contents mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  lower than expected ore grades  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less economical than anticipated  or our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 
our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  cave ins  explosive rock failures  and unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  and legal liability 
for some of these risks  we maintain insurance to protect against these losses at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and  therefore  we do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved 
if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us  is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise impacts our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we may ultimately incur environmental remediation costs substantially in excess of the amounts we have accrued and the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings may be awarded substantial damages  which costs and damages we may not be able to recover from our insurers 
for a description of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
see risks titled our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made and our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage or violating environmental laws  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future 
new legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
there has been no significant activity with respect to mining law reform in congress during the past several years 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
although a majority of our existing us mining operations occur on private or patented property  changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 
see also our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks and political  social and regulatory instability in venezuela may affect us  and md a 
our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental remediation  million of which relates to our various liabilities in idaho  and there is a significant risk that the costs of remediation could materially exceed this provision 
for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our common stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our common shares has been volatile  often based on 
table of contents fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects  such as global economic developments and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  changes in metals prices  particularly gold and silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  foreign political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration program  ability to meet production estimates  environmental and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long term value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
we may not be able to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
in july  we paid outstanding dividends in arrears on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock totaling approximately million 
since july  we have continued to pay regular quarterly dividends on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the annual dividend payable on the preferred stock is currently million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends since the second quarter of there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  
table of contents a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock

item property descriptions operating properties the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver  lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate the principal ore bearing structure mined at the lucky friday unit through was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the orebody is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the orebody has extended from the  foot level to and below the  foot level 
during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
we control the gold hunter property under a long term operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence expiring in february and renewable thereafter  that entitles us  as operator  to an interest in the net profits from operations from the gold hunter property 
we will be obligated to pay a net profits interest of to independence after we have recouped our costs to explore and develop the property 
as of december   unrecouped costs totaled approximately million 
all of our commitments under the operating agreement have been met 
for a description of a legal claim involving the lucky friday unit and independence  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a  ton per day conventional flotation mill 
in  ore was processed at a rate of approximately tons per day 
the flotation process produces both a silver lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc 
all silver lead and zinc concentrate production during was shipped to teck cominco limited s smelter in trail  british columbia  canada 

table of contents information with respect to the lucky friday unit s production  average cost per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves for the past three years is set forth in the table below

cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent measurements that are not in accordance with gaap that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver provide an indicator of profitability and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in item md a  under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
an independent audit of reserves at the lucky friday was conducted by roscoe postle associates inc during our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices december  silver lead zinc reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
we expect an improvement in zinc recovery  from historical levels  due to mill upgrades completed during  and additional mill upgrades scheduled for completion in the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
ultimate reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   approximately million had been accrued for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to  and are in good physical condition 
in  we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries 
additions included a three stage crushing system  
table of contents increased flotation capacity and a new flash cell  new column cells and tailings thickeners 
the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside trade specialists as required

the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock 
the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no discovery triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is escalated annually by the gross domestic product percentage increase until the year greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as dor containing silver and gold 
the dor is sold to a precious metal refiner and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 
the greens creek unit has historically been powered completely by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company 
installation of the necessary infrastructure was completed in  and use of 
table of contents hydroelectric power commenced during the third quarter of it is anticipated that the hydroelectric power will replace to of the total power needs at greens creek through construction of a new hydroelectric plant by the local power company is anticipated by  at which time it is estimated that it will have the capacity to supply of greens creek power 
the employees at greens creek are employees of kennecott greens creek mining company  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  our interest in the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
all equipment  infrastructure and facilities  including camp and concentrate storage facilities  are in good condition 
as of december   we have accrued million for reclamation and closure costs 
a reclamation trust fund has been established and funded for million  our portion of which being approximately million 
this fund replaced other forms of security that had been provided to regulatory agencies 
kennecott greens creek mining company s geology and engineering staff computes the estimated ore reserves  and provides the weighted average metals prices used in the reserve estimates  for the greens creek unit  with technical support from rio tinto plc

the changes in reserves in versus and versus are due to addition of new drill data  increases in forecasted precious metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates for certain orebodies  partially offset by depletion due to production 
proven and probable reserves at the greens creek unit are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
cutoff grades range from per ton net smelter return to per ton net smelter return 
independent reviews by amec e c  inc were completed for reserve models in for the south  and southwest bench deposits  and in for the northwest west zones 
no third party reviews were conducted in the la camorra unit the la camorra unit refers to our venezuelan operating properties and exploration projects  which are discussed below 
for additional information with regard to our venezuelan operating properties  see the la camorra segment in md a 
the la camorra mine is presently operating  and production at the mina isidora mine commenced  with completion of pre production development there  during ore from mina isidora is shipped to the mill at the la camorra mine for processing 
the mill uses a conventional carbon in leach process 
the ore is crushed with a three stage system consisting of a primary jaw crusher with secondary and tertiary cone crusher with a triple deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary and a secondary ball mill 
the ground ore is mixed with a cyanide solution and clarified  followed by countercurrent carbon in leach gold adsorption 
the carbon is then stripped and the gold recovered and poured into gold bars for shipment to a third party refiner 
mill recovery averages approximately all mill equipment  infrastructure and facilities are in good condition 
the mill was constructed in and has been periodically upgraded 
the mill is capable of processing approximately tons per day 
during  we started a custom milling program for small mining cooperatives working in the area of mina isidora 
the cooperatives sell their ore to us for further processing at our la camorra mill 
we also process gold bearing sands purchased from local suppliers 
see custom milling business below

the la camorra mine the la camorra mine is located approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz in the eastern venezuelan state of bol var 
the mine is accessed via a gravel road that we maintain and is six miles east of state highway  which is a paved two lane road running from upata south to the brazilian border 
we acquired the la camorra mine in from monarch resources investments limited monarch  and it is owned by us through our venezuelan subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv 
the purchase agreement includes a provision to pay monarch a net smelter return nsr royalty on production exceeding a cumulative total of  ounces of gold from the properties acquired in venezuela from monarch 
the royalty is based on a sliding scale that is dependent on the price of gold 
when the gold price is below per troy ounce  there is no royalty  when the price is between and per troy ounce the royalty is  when the price is between and per troy ounce  the royalty is  and when the price is and above  the royalty is 
the  ounce production milestone was reached during the second quarter of gold production since that time has been subject to the provisions of the royalty agreement  the payments of which have been offset by our costs incurred related to ongoing tax litigation  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the la camorra mine is located on an exploration concession granted by the ministry of energy and mines in that has been converted to a fifty year exploitation license 
the mine is a high grade underground gold mine that exploits two shear zone hosted quartz veins known as the main zone and the betzy vein 
it lies in the botanamo greenstone belt of the precambrian guayana shield and is hosted by the caballape group of volcanoclastic rocks 
the formations most likely date from archean to proterozoic in age and consist primarily of intermediate volcanics with subordinate metasediments 
gold mineralization at la camorra is confined to narrow  near vertical quartz veins hosted in an east west trending  left lateral shear zone 
most economic mineralization in the la camorra veins occur in distinct ore shoots 
gold occurs both as free particles in quartz and attached to  or included in  pyrite 
locally  gold is also seen on chloritic partings 
in  the principal working levels of the la camorra mine lay between the elevations of and meters below sea level 
the proven and probable reserves extend to the meter elevation and exploration drill holes have intersected gold mineralization below the current reserve limits at the meter level 
at the end of  the mine had been developed to the meter level 
engineering studies undertaken in and indicated that the combination of ventilation and haulage requirements would make mining below the meter level extremely difficult and marginally economic without the development of a shaft 
in august  due to the long construction lead time necessary  the board of directors approved the development of a production shaft at the la camorra mine in order to develop further ore reserves and mine more efficiently at greater depths 
we began using the production shaft during the second half of the shaft loading station is at the meter level and is approximately meters below sea level 
the underground workings at the la camorra mine are accessed via the shaft and a ramp from the surface  excavated at a grade  that provides access to numerous levels 
the main access ramp has been developed to a depth of approximately meters below sea level 
ore is mined primarily by longhole stoping and is extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in mine haulage trucks and  beginning in the second half of  
table of contents the production shaft 
sub economic material can be used to backfill mined out stopes 
the mine is currently producing approximately tons of ore per day 
site infrastructure  equipment and facilities are in good condition and include a water supply system  maintenance shop  warehouse  living quarters  a dining facility  administration building and a national guard post 
we also share a housing facility located near the town of el callao with units for approximately families 
mine electric power is purchased from eleoriente a state owned electric company 
diesel powered electric generators are available on site for operation of critical equipment during power outages 
at december   the net book value of the la camorra mine property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
our reclamation plan has been approved by the ministry of environment and natural resources 
planned activities include recontouring and revegetation of disturbed areas 
the reclamation and closure accrual as of december   was million 
at december   there were hourly and salaried employees associated with the la camorra mine 
the hourly employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  the contract for which expired in october negotiations for the collective labor contract commenced in january the company believes that the agreement will be signed in march and submitted to the labor ministry  and that the contract will provide incentives for approximately workers to voluntarily terminate 
if all of the workers accept the voluntary termination incentive  we will record a total cost to operations in of approximately million  primarily in the first quarter 
in addition  there were employees contracted to fill in for vacation and absentee purposes  and employees at the administrative office in puerto ordaz as of december  information with respect to the la camorra mine s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven and probable ore reserves  total tons    gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces    the company s estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on a gold price of  and per ounce  respectively  in  and proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
an independent audit of the year end reserves at the la camorra mine was completed in by roscoe postle associates inc rpa 
the year end proven and probable reserves decrease in tonnage and grade  as well as an associated decrease in ounces when compared to the year end proven and probable reserves  are a result of mining depletion of  tons in  not extending reserve limits in and encountering lower than expected grade in development areas compared to the grade estimated in the reserve estimate 
the year end reserves show an increase in tonnage and decrease in grade resulting in a decrease in ounces when compared to the year end reserves 
the changes resulted from a combination of new drill data and underground sampling information  a revision of ore shoot limits and the increase in mine dilution being applied to the betzy vein material together with a depletion of reserves by mining 
at the end of  the la camorra mine development of the vein system is complete within meters vertical of the reserve limit 
accordingly  proven and probable ore reserve estimates at the la camorra mine are primarily based on polygonal estimates from development headings and drilling with spacing of to meters 
cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the cutoff grade at la camorra is ounces of gold per ton 
we also have the exploration rights to approximately  hectares square miles adjacent to the la camorra mine 
this property is controlled through eight different contracts with the venezuelan state owned development company  corporacion venezolana de guayana  as well as five different concessions with the ministry of basic industries and mines formerly the ministry of energy and mines 
the contracts and concessions were granted at various times with expiration dates between and  and most are renewable for a period of to years 

table of contents in  proven and probable reserves decreased at the la camorra mine as the deposit exhibited lower ore grades 
no significant exploration results were returned from drilling on the la camorra veins during in  we anticipate that we will reach the end of the known mine life at the la camorra mine 
however  continued exploration activity in will focus on the delineation of new auriferous zones on the concessions surrounding the la camorra concession 
drilling on these targets will commence once permitting requirements are met 
block b in march  we acquired the block b exploration and mining lease near el callao in the venezuelan state of bol var from cvg minerven  a venezuelan government owned gold mining company 
the lease runs through march the area s mining history dates back to the s 
block b is a seven square mile property position in the el callao gold mining district and contains many historic mines including the chile  laguna and panama mines  which collectively produced over million ounces of gold between and pursuant to the lease agreement  we will pay cvg minerven a royalty of to on production from block b  based on production levels 
the royalty terms are i if the price of gold is below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  ii if the price of gold is equal or greater than and equal to or below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  and iii if the price of gold is greater than per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment 
in  million in royalty expense was incurred relating to production at block b 
as a result of limited production in  million in royalty expense was incurred 
prior to inception of production  we made lease payments of  in to cvg minerven 
the el callao area is located approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz in the eastern venezuelan state of bol var  and is just a short distance from highway  a paved two lane road running from upata south to the brazilian border 
overall good infrastructure exists and an kw electricity power line supplies the area predominantly populated by miners operating underground small scale mines 
the population of el callao is approximately  people 
geologically  the gold is found in shear zone hosted quartz veins and stockworks in proterozoic greenstone volcanics  primarily andesitic to basaltic lavas and pyroclastics 
gold occurs as free gold in quartz and is also commonly associated with coarse grained pyrite 
upon acquisition  exploration began on the chile vein system  which we believed to host high grade gold mineralization 
the chile mine itself was an important gold producer that historically produced more than  ounces of gold at an average grade of over one ounce per ton 
since the mine shut down in the s  two phases of exploration drilling were undertaken prior to our work in the block b lease area  one in the s  and more recent drill testing in the s that encountered high grades west of the old mine 
during and  we completed an exploration drilling campaign including drill holes and  meters of drilling resulting in the discovery of what we refer to as mina isidora  which we access via a ramp and an inclined shaft 
during  production at mina isidora included  tons of ore and  ounces of gold 
mina isidora ore is shipped to the mill at the la camorra concession for beneficiation 
at december   the net book value for the development of mina isidora and related plant and equipment totaled million 
in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million 
at december   there were salaried and hourly employees associated with block b 
information with respect to mina isidora s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven and probable ore reserves  total tons    gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces    
table of contents proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
associated mining consultants  ltd 
completed an independent audit of the year end reserves at mina isidora in our estimates of proven and probable reserves were based on a gold price of  and per ounce  respectively  in  and proven and probable ore reserves at mina isidora are based on diamond drill hole spacing of to meters  and estimated using geostatistical modeling 
cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the changes to the mina isidora ore reserves in compared to are attributed to additional drill data  changes in modeling techniques  changes in mining assumptions  mining depletion and costs 
the cutoff grade at isidora is ounces of gold per ton 
exploration work at mina isidora in will include drilling of known mineralized zones to determine if these areas could be mineable 
in addition  exploration will be performed to the west along strike of the isidora trend and to a depth of approximately to meters below the known mineralization 
outside the mina isidora area  other exploration work on the block b concessions included geologic mapping  geophysical surveying  geochemical sampling and  meters of exploration diamond drilling 
this work lead to the discovery of two mineralized zones  the twin and conductora mineralized zones  located approximately one kilometer northeast of the mina isidora orebody 
the twin structure was discovered through drilling during in the second quarter of  and is host to a large mineralized zone known as the twin mineralized zone 
the twin mineralized zone has a minimum strike length of meters and a minimum vertical extent of meters  and is still open down dip and along strike 
mineralization is somewhat erratic with values ranging from ounces per ton to over ounces per ton and widths from one meter to over meters 
the gold mineralization is associated with disseminated pyrite in a moderate to strong schistose shear zone  with moderate to intense ankerite sericite alteration and minor quartz veining 
additional drilling is planned for the conductora structure  which is a possible extension to the northeast of the twin structure  is a second shear zone that has been traced over a strike length of about meters and is still open in both directions along strike and also down dip 
the structure is host to the conductora mineralized zone  which has erratic gold values associated with sulphides in narrow  quartz veins and or wide zones of quartz veinlets in moderate to intensely schistose rocks with strong ankerite sericite alteration 
the significance of the twin conductora discovery is that it outlines a previously unidentified shear structure and a new style of mineralization on the block b concession that might exist in other unexplored areas 
exploration will also be performed on the panama structure  where encouraging gold values of approximately to ounces per ton  to as high as ounces per ton  were intercepted in the a lode structure  which may represent the eastern strike continuation of the panama structure  will also be drill tested 
custom milling business during  we completed construction of a small scale crushing and sampling plant on the block b concessions that allows us to purchase ore produced from small underground mines in the area 
ore purchased from the small mines are crushed  sampled and assayed at the sampling plant  and then trucked to the mill at the la camorra mine for further beneficiation 
the sampling plant is designed to process up to tons of purchased ore per day 
payment for the ore is calculated and made to the miners generally within three days of assaying of the ore 
we also purchase ore and gold bearing sands from small mining groups and suppliers in the el dorado and el callao areas  which are shipped directly to the mill at the la camorra mine 
as a part of this program  we provide small mine operators with financing and technical assistance  including technical advice on mining techniques  grade controls and safety standards 
the small mine activity in venezuela is a significant part of the country s mining industry  and we believe working with 
table of contents the miners provides goodwill and develops positive relationships with local mining groups  as well as assistance to the communities that are impacted by our operations 
we have received a positive response from local and national politicians and citizens for our efforts in helping the small mining cooperatives to improve their practices  and for assisting in providing a stimulus to the local economy 
as part of the custom milling business  we enter into contracts with the small mining groups and advance funds in the form of equipment and working capital  and collect such advances from ore delivered to the sampling and crushing plant 
as of december   we had unrecouped advances to small mining cooperatives totaling million  net of a reserve of million  for geologic and technical factors which inhibit recoupment from the small miner community 
the net book value of the plant and equipment associated with the custom milling business was million at december  in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million

our performance in demonstrated the operational strength of our assets  as we produced million ounces of silver at a total cash cost of per ounce 
we also produced  ounces of gold at a total cash cost of per ounce  with higher production  at a lower total cash cost per ounce  than last year 
at the same time  we committed to a higher level of exploration than at any other time in our history  with over million expensed to invest in our future in several world class mining districts 
in  we reported revenues of million and net income of million  or per diluted share  which represents an increase of over revenues  and an improvement in earnings of million over last year s net loss of million 
cash flow from operating activities increased by million  from million used in to million provided this year 
the primary factors in the improvements to our financial results in were increased metals prices and the sale of our investment in alamos gold  inc  which yielded a pre tax gain of million in the first quarter of average prices for silver increased by from to  while average gold prices rose by 
prices for lead and zinc important by products of silver production at lucky friday and greens creek increased as well  with lead up by over its average level  and zinc higher by 
the factors driving metals prices are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict  while the strength of prices brought us significant benefits  we remain at risk for downturns in prices 
average prices in compared to those in are illustrated below year ended december  silver london pm fix ounce gold london pm fix ounce lead lme final cash buyer pound zinc lme final cash buyer pound milestones along with the strong financial performance in described above  we attained several significant accomplishments  including the sale of our investment in alamos gold  inc  in the first quarter  for million in cash proceeds  generating a pre tax gain of million

objectives we anticipate in production of approximately million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold  continuation of our major exploration program with planned projects in the silver valley of northern idaho  in the vicinity of greens creek in alaska  at our concessions in the state of durango  mexico  and at our concessions in the el dorado and el callao districts of venezuela  full staffing and increased activity at our office in vancouver  bc  canada  which we established in january  investment in ventilation and metallurgical process improvements at our lucky friday mine  maintenance of a strong balance sheet 
key issues we expect our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves will be implemented by development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we overcome several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in the mining and sale of metals from multiple international locations 
one such challenge is metals prices 
while the metals mining industry enjoyed significantly higher prices in than in recent prior years  we have very little control over prices 
we must make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which is a daunting challenge to an industry for which new opportunities can require several years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future  and that our strategic plans could be affected as a result 
in accordance with our environmental policy  our operating activities will be conducted in a manner that attempts to minimize risks to public health and safety 
we believe that natural resources can be developed and utilized in a manner consistent with proper stewardship for the environment  and our projects will be designed and managed in an attempt to reasonably minimize risk and negative effects on the environment 
we will continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we face challenges also from political  social  and regulatory change in venezuela 
in  our cash balance increased in venezuela to million translated at the official exchange rate of  bol vars to as a result of the criminal exchange act  which regulates the movement of cash from venezuela at the official rate 
we are able to repatriate cash to the us  however  in doing so we must utilize specific government programs that have been limited or slow  or utilize negotiable instruments on 
table of contents which we have incurred losses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
another challenge to us in venezuela is the government s view on strategic industries 
following the presidential election of december  the government in january announced the intention of nationalizing strategic industries  including petroleum and communications  now owned by private entities 
while mining was not mentioned as a strategic industry  we will continue to monitor the government s view of the mining industry in venezuela 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
even as our silver  lead  and zinc reserves increased in  we face challenges in our gold reserves  which declined in after strong production from the la camorra mine since acquisition by us in  the mine faces a significant reduction of activity in due to depletion of reserves  although a lower level of activity will continue as we produce from smaller remnant ore zones 
the nearby mina isidora mine  which utilizes the processing plant at la camorra  continues to produce as designed with over  ounces in reserves  and our exploration programs will continue in both the el callao and el dorado districts of venezuela in results of operations for the year ended december   we reported income applicable to common shareholders of million  compared to losses applicable to common shareholders of million and million in and  respectively 
the improved results over the comparable and periods were primarily the result of the sale of our investment in alamos gold  inc  in january  for million in cash proceeds  generating a pre tax gain of million  increased gross profit at our lucky friday  greens creek and la camorra units see the lucky friday segment  greens creek segment and la camorra segment sections below for further discussion of operating results  an million income tax benefit resulting from a deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment  partially offset by a million income tax provision for us alternative minimum tax  which includes a million provision relating to the gain from the sale of our stock position in alamos gold  inc  and a million tax provision in venezuela see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  the sale of our noche buena gold exploration property in mexico during april  generating a million pre tax gain  and increased average prices for all metals produced at our operations  illustrated by the following table comparing the average prices for the years ended december   and december  silver london pm fix ounce gold london final ounce lead lme final cash buyer pound zinc lme final cash buyer pound our results of operations during were also impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment  which became effective as of january  sfas no 
r requires us to record an expense for the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we are using the modified prospective transition method  which has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  the fair value of the options granted during were estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
as of december   the majority of options outstanding were fully vested  and we recognized stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r of approximately million during  which was recorded to general and administrative expenses and cost of 
table of contents sales and other direct production costs 
over the next twelve months  we expect to recognize an additional million in compensation expense for unvested awards as required by sfas no 
r 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our adoption of sfas no 
r 
included in expense recognized in pursuant to adoption of sfas no 
r was million from the modification of  outstanding share options granted prior to the adoption of the statement 
the modification was pursuant to changes in the internal revenue service requirements relating to employee deferred compensation arrangements 
as a result  the options were converted to stock equivalent units that will be settled in the employees investment accounts 
modification of the options resulted in a charge to compensation expense totaling million 
the respective income and losses applicable to common shareholders for the years ended december   and included preferred stock dividends of million  million and million 
the dividends included non cash charges of million related to exchanges of preferred stock for common stock 
all preferred dividends previously not declared and in arrears have been paid 
the lucky friday segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our lucky friday segment dollars are in thousands  except per ounce amounts years ended december  sales    cost of sales and other direct production costs  depreciation  depletion and amortization  gross profit    tons of ore milled    silver ounces produced   lead tons produced    zinc tons produced    silver ounces per ton lead percent zinc percent total cash cost per silver ounce by product credits    by product credit per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below in reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in gross profit in  compared to and  resulted primarily from higher average metals prices and increased production  partially offset by lower silver and lead ore grades and increased costs related to mining at greater depth 
full production on the level expansion was reached in the fourth quarter of  resulting in approximately  ounces of silver mined from the level during upgrades to the mill in allowed increased capacity and created operating efficiencies that  when coupled with the increased production from the level  increased our tons milled by compared to however  this was partially offset by a decrease in silver ore grade due to the nature of the current ore body and increased zinc production 
completion of additional mill upgrades  including an on stream analyzer and increased flotation capacity  is anticipated in the third quarter of the decrease in total cash costs per silver ounce in  as compared to and  is attributed to improved by product credits resulting from increasing average lead and zinc prices  partially offset by 
table of contents higher production costs 
increased productivity and lower transportation costs  due to the new development on the level  has also contributed to the improved total cash costs per ounce 
while value from lead and zinc is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver accounts for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to the increased average prices 
the greens creek segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our greens creek segment dollars are in thousands  except per ounce amounts  and reflect our share years ended december  sales    cost of sales and other direct production costs  depreciation  depletion and amortization   gross profit    tons of ore milled    silver ounces produced   gold ounces produced    zinc tons produced    lead tons produced    silver ounces per ton gold ounces per ton zinc percent lead percent total cash cost per silver ounce by product credits    by product credit per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in reconciliation of total cash costs to costs non gaap of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in gross profit during  compared to was primarily the result of higher average metals prices  partially offset by the effects of mine rehabilitation work and higher diesel prices 
ground falls in various areas of the mine in the third quarter of resulted in the allocation of resources to rehabilitation work 
throughout  greens creek continued to focus manpower and equipment on mine rehabilitation work relating to ground support reinforcement in the main haulage ways 
underground congestion caused by alternative truck routing  and the lack of available mine ore faces both results of the focus on rehabilitation work decreased production during the first six months of a mining contract company was engaged during the second quarter of to help maintain production and reduce the effects of the rehabilitation work  and ore production for the second half of was higher compared to the same period of as a result 
additionally  tons of ore 
table of contents milled during were greater than production levels for the period 
a majority of the rehabilitation work has been completed during and  and we anticipate production to return to historic levels during infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by alaska electric light and power company ael p  via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
all infrastructure is in place  and use of the system commenced in august ael p has agreed to supply its excess power to greens creek  which will replace an estimated to of the diesel generated power through completion of a new hydroelectric plant by ael p is anticipated by  at which time it is estimated ael p will supply of greens creek power 
this project is anticipated to reduce production costs at greens creek in the future 
the improvement in total cash costs per silver ounce in  compared to  is attributable to increased by product credits  as zinc  lead and gold prices exceeded prices during the same period  partially offset by higher production costs 
the increase in total cash cost per silver ounce in versus  was due to increased production costs  partially offset by improved by product credits 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery  and the recent increase in the zinc price changed the balance of revenue for greens creek  so that zinc competed with silver for the largest portion of total revenue in we will continue to monitor the relationship of revenue contribution among the metals produced from greens creek  however  until zinc sustains its high price relative to silver for a longer period  we continue to view silver as our primary product 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to increased prices 
the la camorra segment the following table provides a comparison of operating results and key production statistics for our venezuelan operations  which include the la camorra mine  a custom milling business and mina isidora  where full production was reached in the third quarter of dollars are in thousands  except per ounce amounts 
table of contents years ended december  sales    cost of sales and other direct production costs  depreciation  depletion and amortization   gross profit    tons of ore milled    gold ounces produced    gold ounce per ton total cash cost per gold ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in la camorra unit sales  compared to and  was due to higher average gold prices  higher overall ore grades  and increased ore volume from mina isidora  as pre production development work was completed in in addition  a strike at the la camorra mine suspended operations for days during the third quarter of the strike  along with subsequent labor issues  significantly impacted production at the la camorra unit during the second half of also contributing to the increase in sales   ounces of gold held in inventory at the end of were sold within venezuela during the second quarter of the increase in sales was partially offset by the following items that negatively impacted gross profit  compared to and mining at greater depths at the la camorra mine resulted in increased per unit production costs  escalating labor  commodity and transportation costs related to haulage of ore mined from mina isidora  and ore purchased from small third party mining operations to our milling facility located approximately miles from mina isidora  discontinuation of foreign exchange gains that decreased cost of sales in as a result of changes in venezuelan currency regulations 
during and  we recognized foreign exchange gains of million and million  respectively  that partially reduced our cost of sales reported for those years 
no such gains have been recognized in  during we recorded a million reserve for materials inventory impairment at the la camorra mine that also negatively affected cost of sales  increased depreciation expense as a result of the commissioning of the shaft at the la camorra mine in  discussed in more detail below  and reduced production from the la camorra mine due to mining at greater depths  lower productivity  and reduced reserves 
in order to mine more efficiently at greater depths and potentially develop further proven and probable reserves  we made the decision in to construct a production shaft at the la camorra mine 
construction of the shaft was completed  and it was placed into service during the third quarter of proven and probable ore reserves have continued to decrease at the la camorra mine since  as it has exhibited lower ore grades  and no significant results have been returned from drilling in the la camorra vicinity 
as a result  reduced production levels from the la camorra mine are anticipated to continue  and we anticipate that we will reach the end of the known mine life there during depreciation expense related to the shaft has negatively affected gross profit for the la camorra unit since it was commissioned  and we expect it to continue to do so until the shaft is depreciated to a minimal value in the second half of continued exploration activity on concessions surrounding the 
table of contents la camorra mine is planned for however  declining proven and probable ore reserves at lower ore grade will have an impact on any decisions for longer term plans at the la camorra mine  and we will continue to assess whether remaining ounces there can be economically extracted 
a factor in our assessment will be the degree of success of our plan to reduce the workforce at the la camorra mine by approximately workers through voluntary termination incentives in  at a cost of approximately million to operations 
an increasing percentage of total ore for the la camorra unit will come from mina isidora  which uses a more expensive mining method due to the dip of the vein 
we anticipate that this will be largely offset  however  by the higher gold grades at mina isidora compared to the la camorra mine 
the construction of the production shaft was more costly and took longer than originally anticipated  and we disputed some of the shaft construction costs submitted by the contractor 
pursuant to the construction agreement  we submitted the matter to arbitration in november in january  the matter was resolved  resulting in a dismissal of the arbitration and all claims by each party against the other 
as a result of the settlement  we accrued an additional million for the project 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
functional currency for venezuelan operations effective january   we will implement a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bol var  the local currency in venezuela 
we believe that significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances affecting our venezuelan operations indicate that a change in the functional currency is appropriate  under the provisions of fasb statement no 
sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the balance sheet for our venezuelan operations will be recalculated as of january   so that all assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate of  bol vares to  the fixed  official exchange rate 
we will use the official exchange rate pursuant to guidance from the aicpa s international practices task force 
as a result  the dollar value of non monetary assets  previously translated at historical exchange rates  will be significantly reduced 
the offsetting translation adjustment will be recorded to equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
see note subsequent events of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
business risks in venezuela currency and related risks in october  the venezuelan government enacted the criminal exchange law  which imposes strict criminal and economic sanctions on the exchange of venezuelan currency with other foreign currency through other than officially designated methods  or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
approvals for foreign currency exchange are limited and we are evaluating opportunities to minimize our exposure to devaluation 
as a consequence  our cash balances denominated in bol vares that are maintained in venezuela have increased from a us dollar equivalent of approximately million at december   to million at december  additionally  we will convert into venezuelan currency  the proceeds of venezuelan exports made over the past days  or a total value of approximately million  through june during the second half of  we exchanged the us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the official exchange rate of  bol vares to for approximately million at an open market exchange rate of  bol vares to  incurring a foreign exchange loss for the difference 
although we are making appropriate applications through the venezuelan government  our cash balances denominated in the venezuelan bol var may continue to grow and any future conversions or devaluation of the bol var may result in further losses when and if in the future we decide to distribute money outside venezuela 
at march   the open market exchange rate was approximately bol vares  to 
prior to the enactment of the criminal exchange law  we recognized foreign exchange gains of approximately million and million in and  respectively  as markets outside of venezuela have reflected a devaluation of the venezuelan currency from the fixed rate 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange 
table of contents controls in venezuela  although the venezuelan exchange control regulations have limited our ability to repatriate cash and receive dividends or other distributions without substantial cost 
we believe this will continue into the future  and will continue to impact our profitability of operations compared to previous periods 
seniat litigation our wholly owned subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv  which owns and operates our la camorra mine  is involved in litigation with the venezuelan tax authority seniat concerning alleged unpaid tax liabilities that predate our purchase of la camorra from monarch resources investments limited monarch in pursuant to our purchase agreement  monarch has assumed defense of and responsibility for a pending tax case in the superior tax court in caracas 
in april  seniat filed with the superior tax court in bol var city  state of bol var  an embargo action against all of mhv s assets in venezuela to secure the alleged unpaid tax liabilities 
in order to prevent the embargo  mhv made a cash deposit with the court in april of approximately million  at exchange rates in effect at that time 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered suspension and revocation of the embargo action filed by seniat  although the court has maintained the million until such tax liabilities are settled 
in october  mhv and seniat reached a mutual agreement to settle the case  which is awaiting approval by the court 
as required by the terms of the agreement  mhv paid approximately million in exchange for a release of the alleged tax liabilities and release of the cash bond 
in a separate agreement  monarch will reimburse mhv for all amounts in settling the case  including defense costs  through a reduction in mhv s royalty obligations to them 
although we believe the cash deposit will continue to prevent any further action by seniat with respect to the embargo related to this case  and that mhv s settlement efforts will be successful  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this proceeding until a final settlement is executed and entered by the court 
if the tax court in caracas or an appellate court were to subsequently award seniat the previously requested embargo  it could disrupt our venezuelan operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
in a separate matter  in february we were notified by seniat that it had completed its audit of our venezuelan tax returns for the years ended december  and in the notice  seniat alleged that certain expenses are not deductible for income tax purposes and that calculations of tax deductions based upon inflationary adjustments were overstated  and issued an assessment equal to taxes payable of million 
we reviewed seniat s findings and submitted an appeal 
in march  the appeal was resolved in our favor and we were found not liable for the million assessment 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional assessments in the future  or that seniat or other governmental agencies or officials will not take other actions against us  whether or not justified  which  in each case  could materially disrupt our operations in venezuela 
other although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  there is a continued uncertainty in venezuela relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  as well as export and exchange controls 
this uncertain environment could affect our operations  including changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  industry nationalization  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations  and impacting our supplies of oil  gas and other goods 
as a result  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations  and any such occurrences  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition

operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash used of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher net income  adjusted for non cash elements  by million in the primary driver of higher income was favorable metals prices and increased production  with all four metals produced by us at levels exceeding average prices by over  and timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of our business  with non cash working capital increasing by million in net cash used by operating activities was million in  in contrast to cash provided in totaling million 
the most significant changes over the two years included a million increase in our net loss in compared to as a result of increased pre development expense at hollister  and decreased income from our la camorra and san sebastian units  partially offset by working capital requirements that were less in than in due to lower working capital requirements in venezuela and liquidation of inventories at san sebastian 
investing activities our net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in totaling million

table of contents partially offset by net increases in short term investments in compared to net decreases in as our cash position strengthened 
our net cash used by investing activities was million in  in contrast to million in the decrease in cash used in was primarily due to lower requirements for restricted cash bonding at greens creek and in venezuela in  and higher liquidations of short term investments in  partially offset by higher expenditures for property  plant  and equipment in  primarily for the la camorra shaft project and development at mina isidora in venezuela  and a mill upgrade and development of the level at lucky friday

we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
gold production from our la camorra mine and block b property in venezuela is subject to royalties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the royalty provisions 
the amount of our royalty obligations is dependent upon the number of gold ounces produced and the gold price 
based on our current projections for production at la camorra and block b  and the average gold price for  we estimate our future royalty payments will be million for  million for and million for we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 

table of contents we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  and mineral reserves  as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made  and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
as shown under item a 
risk factors  metals prices have been historically volatile 
while average prices for all four metals we produce have increased for four consecutive years  we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices in the past  and we can offer no assurance that prices will remain at their current levels or higher 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine the carrying values of our assets  our depreciation rates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the most likely outcome to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
future metals prices also affect our assessment of recoverability of certain accounts receivable 
we hold accounts receivable from various mining cooperatives in venezuela from whom we purchase custom ores and sands 
our assessment of gold prices helps us to assess the future profitability of the cooperatives which  in turn  informs the level of recoverability of receivables from the cooperatives 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements have not been fully determined  nor have they been agreed between us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities with expert counsel and in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the range of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings considerably exceeds the liabilities we have recognized 
if substantial damages were awarded in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 
reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying 
table of contents values are reported appropriately 
reserves represent a culmination of many estimates  and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals

see the discussion in special note on forward looking statements included prior to part i  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable see part i  item a risk factors 

table of contents cash exchange control regulations in venezuela have limited our ability to repatriate cash and receive dividends or other distributions without substantial cost 
at december  and december   we held the us dollar equivalent of approximately million and million  respectively  denominated in the venezuelan bol vares  bs 
to 
additionally  we will convert into venezuelan currency the proceeds of venezuelan exports made over the past days  approximately million  through june exchanging our cash held in local currency into us dollars can be done through specific governmental programs  or through the use of negotiable instruments on which we have incurred and may incur additional foreign currency losses 
during the second half of  we exchanged the us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the official exchange rate of  bs 
to for million at the open market exchange rate  incurring a foreign exchange loss for the difference 
although we are making appropriate applications through the venezuelan government  our cash balances denominated in venezuelan bol vares may continue to grow and any future conversions may result in further losses when and if we decide to distribute money outside venezuela 
short term investments our december  short term investments of million  consisting of variable rate demand notes and adjustable rate securities  were subject to changes in market interest rates and were sensitive to those changes 
our short term investments were subject to a weighted average interest rate of and mature over the next twelve months 
commodity price risk management at times  we use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures 
interest rate risk management at december   we had no debt outstanding 
however  our revolving credit facility  if used  would be subject to changes in market interest rates 
for additional information regarding our million revolving credit facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
venezuelan currency exchange rates effective january   we will implement a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bolivare  the local currency in venezuela 
as a result of this change  the us dollar equivalent value of the non monetary assets of our venezuela operation would fluctuate with a change in the official exchange rate of the bolivare 
we estimate that the implementation of the functional currency change at january   using the current official exchange rate of  bolivares to  will result in a reduction to net assets of approximately million  with a translation adjustment for the same amount recorded to other comprehensive income 
a increase in the official exchange rate at january  would result in a reduction to net assets of approximately million upon the implementation of the change
