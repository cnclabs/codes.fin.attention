the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest season for our diversified gaming segment 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
additionally  the fourth quarter is the weakest quarter for global draw due to reduced wagering during the holiday season 
wagering and lottery equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results of our lottery systems group can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software licensing transactions 
in addition  printed products sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions

critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prized on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations to customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to a specific contract 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total contract costs which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the total fixed price of the contract and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery and pari mutuel systems which require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of its products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
share based payment we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we apply the accounting requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires us to record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  we analyze a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
we engage third party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of fair value estimates 
changes to the assumptions used to estimate fair value could materially affect the recorded amounts for acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including but not limited to  property  plant and equipment  customer lists  goodwill  and deferred income taxes 
significant changes to the recorded amounts could have a material impact on our future operating results  including changes in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from higher or lower fair values assigned to property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill and trademark may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations income taxes and deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is unlikely 
we have also established a valuation allowance for foreign loss carryforwards  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these items will not be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record reserves for what we identify as probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved 
the estimate of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with various tax filing positions 
based on information about other tax settlements  we estimate amounts that we may agree to settle with taxing authorities in order to conclude audits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution

on december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuance under our revolver 
there were million of borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolver as of december  effective with the january amended and restated agreement  we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuance under our revolver 
our ability to borrow under the january amended and restated credit agreement will depend on our remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of the specified financial covenants 
we were in compliance with its covenants as of december  and for all of the quarters included in the fiscal year our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below cash payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years after years in thousands long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  term loan c long term debt  term loan d long term debt  revolving credit facility other long term debt interest expense purchase obligation operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the convertible debentures are due however  these convertible debentures could require cash payment before that date if holders of these convertible debentures elect to convert the convertible debentures when the market price of our common stock equals or exceeds  subject to certain conditions  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  or upon certain corporate transactions 
based on rates in effect at december  we have a purchase order outstanding as of december  for approximately  fixed odds betting terminals with a total cost of approximately million 
as of december    or approximately million has been paid as cash deposits on the purchase order 
because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments  we have excluded all but million of cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our pension plans and deferred compensation plans of approximately million at december  in august  we paid cash of million  including a million redemption premium  to redeem all of the remaining senior subordinated notes due our pari mutuel wagering and online lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  the revenues we derive from our pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
in the next year  we expect to replace approximately  and  existing pari mutuel and fixed odds betting terminals  respectively  for a total cost of approximately million 
as of december   we have paid cash deposits of approximately million related to the  fixed odds betting terminals 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  effective with the january amendment  we had approximately million available for additional borrowings or letter of credit issuance under our revolver 
the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase decrease in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets and decreases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  are less than expenditures totaling million in the corresponding period in wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in shanghai  mexico  maryland and oklahoma  coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the facility 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacities fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  repayment of our outstanding debt and changes in our working capital position 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million exceeded cash used in investing activities of million  excluding funds used for acquisitions and debt financing fees 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from net cash provided by operations of million coupled with million provided by changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in short term investments  along with increases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets and decreases in accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures of million in increased million from the prior year primarily due to the build out of the alpharetta  georgia facility and the purchase of a short run printing press 
wagering systems expenditures of million in  increased million from the prior year primarily due to new online lottery contracts in puerto rico  spain  mexico  oklahoma and colorado 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the facility 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the facility  as amended  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
further  the terms of the indenture governing the convertible debentures give holders the right to convert the convertible debentures when the market price of our class a common stock exceeds a defined target market price 
the terms of such indenture require us to pay cash for the face amount of the convertible debentures which have been presented for conversion  with the value of the difference between the stated conversion price and the prevailing market price payable by our issuance of additional shares of our class a common stock 
we cannot offer any assurance that we will have sufficient available cash to pay for the convertible debentures presented to us for conversion nor can we offer any assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of the converted convertible debentures at that time

the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan became effective december   and we adopted the recognition requirements as of december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of an employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is not applicable to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see item a risk factors for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and working capital 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  spain  sweden  mexico  austria  chile and ireland 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
during  we made a material acquisition in the united kingdom 
this acquisition has increased our market risk associated with foreign currency movements 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro and the sterling in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies  to the extent possible 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we believe that a hypothetical upward or downward fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the united states dollar would not have a material impact on future earnings  fair values  or cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
