item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the ratios and percentages provided below are calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
general we serve as a bank holding company for capitalbank 
we formed capitalbank on january  during a restructuring that consolidated our operations into a single subsidiary 
capitalbank operates seventeen branches throughout south carolina 
capitalbank offers a full range of banking services  including a wealth management group featuring a wide array of financial services  with personalized attention  local decision making  and strong emphasis on the needs of individuals and small to medium sized businesses 
we were formed in to serve as a holding company for greenwood national bank  which later changed its name to greenwood bank trust 
in we made the decision to expand beyond greenwood county by creating an organization of independent banks in four additional markets 
in june  we opened clemson bank trust in clemson  south carolina 
in and  we opened community bank trust  the bank  and mid state bank 
we formed a separate trust organization in known as community trust company 
during and  we also acquired several carolina first branches 
in may  we sold community trust company 
in july of  we acquired a carolina first branch and an anchor bank branch 
as discussed  on january   we merged the five subsidiary banks into one bank charter known as capitalbank 
we made the decision to restructure the organization into one bank in order to improve operational efficiencies  provide new opportunities for employees  and improve service to customers 
customers are able to receive the benefit of being able to transact business at any of capitalbank s branches  through the atm network and through the internet banking products 
additionally  we believe that the new centralized credit function provides additional controlled decisions while streamlining the credit process 
centralized deposit pricing supports management s strategy from market to market 
we also believe that the name recognition has enhanced our business 
on january   capitalbank announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with enterprise bank of south carolina to sell capitalbank s five branch offices located in barnwell  blackville  williston  springfield and salley  south carolina 
on may   capitalbank sold the five branches  which had approximately million in deposits 
on august   we signed a letter of interest to acquire abbeville capital corporation  the holding company of the bank of abbeville 
in october  the board of directors of both companies approved a definitive agreement 
the transaction closed in march on june   the company formed community capital corporation statutory trust i the trust for the purposes of issuing trust preferred securities  which enable the company to obtain tier capital on a consolidated basis for regulatory purposes 
on june   the company closed a private offering of  of floating rate preferred securities offered and sold by the trust 
the proceeds from such issuance together with the proceeds from a related issuance of common securities of the trust purchased by the company in the amount of  were invested by the trust in floating rate junior subordinated notes issued by the company the notes totaling million 
the notes are due and payable on june  and may be redeemed by the company after five years  and sooner in certain specific events  including in the event that certain circumstances render the notes ineligible for treatment as tier capital  subject to prior approval by the federal reserve board  if then required 
the notes presently qualify as tier capital for regulatory reporting 
the sole assets of the trust are the notes 
the company owns of the common securities of the trust 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to all senior debt of the company 
for the year ended december   the floating rate preferred securities and the notes has an annual interest rate of 
this interest rate is fixed until june   when the interest rate will adjust quarterly 
after june   the interest rate will equal three month libor plus

net income increased  or  to million in from million in basic earnings per share was in  compared to in diluted earnings per share was in  compared to in return on average assets during was compared to during  and return on average equity was during compared to during net interest income general 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents our net interest margin 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of various measures of our financial performance 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance of each category of our assets liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category during  and a review of these tables shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earniing assets  which is why we direct a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included tables to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest earning accounts and interest bearing accounts 
finally  we have included various tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  our deposits  and other borrowings 
net interest income continued average balances  income and expenses  and rates 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated

all loans and deposits are domestic 
average investment securities exclude the valuation allowance on securities available for sale 
fully tax equivalent basis at tax rate for nontaxable securities and loans 
net interest income continued our tax effected net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   earning assets averaged million compared to million for the year ended december  interest earning assets exceeded interest bearing liabilities by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our margin continues to be negatively impacted by the flat yield curve interest rate environment and our rapid asset generation which has caused us to rely  more than we have historically  on higher cost wholesale funds 
we expect downward pressure on our margin to continue as long as the two conditions described above persist 
for the year ended december   our tax effected net interest income  the major component of our net income  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the average rate realized on interest earning assets increased to at december   from at december   while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased to at december   from at december  our tax effected interest income for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of million on loans  million on investments  and  on interest bearing deposits with correspondent banks 
our tax effected interest income for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of million on loans  million on investments  and  on interest bearing deposits with correspondent banks

the high percentage of interest income from loans related to our strategy to maintain a significant portion of our assets in higher earning loans compared to lower yielding investments 
average loans represented and of average earning assets for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of million related to deposits and million related to other borrowings 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of million related to deposits and million related to other borrowings

average interest bearing deposits represented and of average interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the effect that the varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income from to and to net interest income continued analysis of changes in net interest income compared with compared with variance due to variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total earning assets loans securities  taxable securities  nontaxable nonmarketable equity securities federal funds sold and other total interest income interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances junior subordinate debt obligations under capital leases total interest expense net interest income volume rate changes have been allocated to each category based on the percentage of the total change 
interest sensitivity 
we monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique we employ is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
net interest income continued the following table sets forth our interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis greater after one after three than one within through through within year or december  one three twelve one non dollars in thousands month months months year sensitive total assets earning assets loans securities federal funds sold and other total earning assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans and includes loans held for sale 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements that give us the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
other short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
federal funds purchased are reflected at the earliest pricing interval because funds can be repriced daily 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the maturity date of each repurchase agreement that generally matures within one day 
advances from the federal home loan bank are reflected at their contractual maturity dates 
junior subordinated debentures are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
net interest income continued we generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when we have an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when we are liability sensitive 
our net interest margin continues to be negatively impacted by the flat yield curve interest rate environment and our rapid asset generation  which has caused us to rely  more than we have historically  on higher cost wholesale funds 
we are liability sensitive within the one year period 
however  our gap analysis is not a precise indicator of our interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by us as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  we believe a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of our true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization that depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
we have developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of our credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for capitalbank s allowance for loan losses based upon our recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both us and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on our income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is based upon judgments and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions  and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  we monitor the overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  charge offs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of our monitoring and analysis system are also reviewed periodically by the banking regulators 
based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  we consider the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about future events that we believe to be reasonable but that may or may not be valid 
thus  we have no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
we do not allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans but evaluate the adequacy on an overall portfolio basis utilizing a risk grading system 
included in the statement of income for the years ended december   and  is an expense related to the provision for loan losses of million and  respectively 
we also reported net charge offs of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net charge offs during represented of the average outstanding loan portfolio for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  of the million in total charge offs during  approximately million was comprised of five loans  four of which were secured by real estate 
the increase in the allowance for the year ended december  over december   related to the increase of million in total loans outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans was at december  and at december   while the percentage of nonperforming assets to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage to loans has decreased from december  to december  as a result of placing more emphasis of focusing on historical portfolio performance in accordance with regulatory and accounting literature guidance thereby providing a more accurate forecast of probable future losses 
as a result  we believe the current level of the allowance is adequate 
provision and allowance for loan losses continued the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our allowance for loan losses and the composition of charge offs and recoveries for each of the last five years 
allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year average loans outstanding balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period allowance for loan losses from acquisitions loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total loan losses recoveries of previous loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net loan losses provision for loan losses balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period allowance for loan losses to period end loans net charge offs to average loans nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual and impaired loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end loans provision and allowance for loan losses continued accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  we may ultimately write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if our nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets totaled million at december  and million at december  this amount consists primarily of nonaccrual and impaired loans that totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
nonperforming assets were of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  potential problem loans 
at december   through our internal review mechanisms  we had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
our criticized loans increased from million at december  to million at december  total classified loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  we are committed to addressing potential problem loans 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reason for the decrease was due to the fact that we realized gains on the sales of marketable equity securities of million in  compared to no gains in gains on the sales of premises and equipment were  in  compared to  in the gain in was primarily a result of the sale of a parcel of land in anderson  south carolina 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or to million in  from million in the decrease is mainly due to a reduction in customer non sufficient funds nsf transactions 
residential mortgage origination fees decreased  or to  in from  in the primary reason for the decrease in secondary mortgage fees is that we have expanded our mortgage loan product offerings and are maintaining these loans in house with the exception of the year mortgage loans 
income from fiduciary activities increased  or to million in from  in this increase was a result of our continuing successful efforts to expand assets under management in our wealth management group 
commissions on the sale of mutual funds increased  or to  in compared to  in other operating income decreased  or to million in from million in noninterest income and expense continued the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal components of noninterest income noninterest income year ended december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts residential mortgage origination fees gains on sales of securities available for sale gains on sales of nonmarketable equity securities commissions from sales of mutual funds income from fiduciary activities gain on sale of premises and equipment income from bank owned life insurance other income total noninterest income noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary component of noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits  which increased  or  to million in from million in the increase is mainly due to the addition of staff as a result of the opening of a new branch in april   increased health insurance costs  and annual salary increases 
net occupancy expense was million in compared to  in  and furniture and equipment expense was  in compared to  in we realized a loss on the sale of securities available for sale in the amount of  in  compared to a loss of  in total amortization of intangible assets decreased  or  to  in compared to  in our efficiency ratio was in compared to in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the primary components of noninterest expense noninterest expense year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense amortization of intangible assets director and committee fees data processing and supplies mortgage loan department expenses banking assessments professional fees and services postage and freight supplies telephone expenses loss on securities available for sale other total noninterest expense efficiency ratio noninterest income and expense continued income taxes 
our income tax expense was million for and million for our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
earning assets loans 
loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans were million compared to million at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio by category at the dates indicated and highlights our general emphasis on mortgage lending 
composition of loan portfolio december  percent percent percent percent percent dollars in of of of of of thousands amount total amount total amount total amount total amount total commercial and industrial real estate construction mortgage residential mortgage nonresidential consumer and other total loans allowance for loan losses net loans the principal component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at december   this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
financial institutions in our market areas typically obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
earning assets continued real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential mortgage loans  which is the largest category of our loans  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  increased million or  to million at december  from million at december  the overall increase in real estate lending was attributable to the continued demand for residential and commercial real estate loans in our markets 
capitalbank has been able to compete favorably for residential mortgage loans with other financial institutions by offering fixed rate products having three and five year call provisions 
commercial and industrial loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  consumer and other loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  our loan portfolio reflects the diversity of our markets 
our sixteen full service branches and one stand alone drive thru are located from the northern midlands of south carolina through the upstate 
primary market areas include abbeville  anderson  belton  clemson  clinton  greenville  greenwood  newberry and saluda 
the economies of these markets are varied and represent different industries including medium and light manufacturing  higher education  regional health care  and distribution facilities 
these areas are expected to remain stable with continual growth 
the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
we do not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of our liquidity 
the following table sets forth our loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates over one year december  one year through over five dollars in thousands or less five years years total commercial and industrial real estate consumer and other loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating interest rates earning assets continued the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  we believe this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown in the above table 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  compared to million in at december   the total securities portfolio was million  a decrease of million  or over total securities of million at december  securities designated as available for sale totaled million and were recorded at estimated fair value 
securities designated as held to maturity totaled  and were recorded at amortized cost 
the securities portfolio also includes nonmarketable equity securities totaling million which are carried at cost because they are not readily marketable or have no quoted market value 
these include investments in federal reserve bank stock  federal home loan bank stock  community capital corporation statutory trust i  and the stock of two unrelated financial institutions 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities held by us at the dates indicated

the yield on state and local governments is presented on a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 
other attributes of the securities portfolio  including yields and maturities  are discussed above in net interest income interest sensitivity 
earning assets continued short term investments 
short term investments  which consist primarily of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks  averaged  in  compared to million in at december   short term investments totaled  these funds are a source of our liquidity 
federal funds are generally invested in an earning capacity on an overnight basis 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million in  from million in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million in  from million in deposits 
average total deposits increased million  or  to million during  from million during at december   total deposits were million compared to million a year earlier  an increase of

deposits december  percent percent percent percent percent dollars in of of of of of thousands amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits demand deposit accounts now accounts money market accounts savings accounts time deposits less than time deposits of  or over total deposits core deposits  which exclude certificates of deposit of  or more  provide a relatively stable funding source for our loan portfolio and other earning assets 
our core deposits increased million to million at december  the largest increase in our core deposits was in money market accounts  which increased million  or to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our wall street money market accounts which as of december  paid a premium rate of wall street prime rate less 
deposits  and particularly core deposits  have historically been our primary source of funding and have enabled us to meet successfully both our short term and long term liquidity needs 
we anticipate that such deposits will continue to be our primary source of funding in the future 
our loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of the maturity distribution of our time deposits of  or more at december  is set forth in the following table 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities continued maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more after six within after three through after three through six twelve twelve dollars in thousands months months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more approximately of our time deposits of  or more had scheduled maturities within six months and had maturities within twelve months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not solicit brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of short term borrowings  advances from the federal home loan bank  junior subordinated debentures and our correspondent bank line of credit 
short term borrowings are primarily federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average short term borrowings were million in  an increase of million from million in federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged million in at december   federal funds purchased totaled million 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million in at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million 
average federal home loan bank advances during were million compared to million during  an increase of million 
advances from the federal home loan bank are collateralized by one to four family residential mortgage loans  home equity lines  commercial real estate loans  and our investment in federal home loan bank stock 
at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
although we expect to continue using short term borrowing and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be our primary funding source

average junior subordinated debentures during were million 
average balances on our correspondent bank line of credit during were  the following table summarizes our various sources of borrowed funds for the years ended december  and these borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased  advances from the federal home loan bank  and junior subordinated debentures 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature on a one to seven day basis 
these agreements are secured by government sponsored enterprise securities 
federal funds purchased are short term borrowings from other financial institutions that mature daily 
advances from federal home loan bank mature at different periods as discussed in the footnotes to the financial statements and are secured by the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  home equity lines  commercial real estate loans and the bank s investment in federal home loan bank stock

under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
our tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
our tier capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
the holding company and capitalbank are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets as defined  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to above the minimum 
to provide the additional capital needed to support our bank s growth in assets in  we issued million in junior subordinated debentures in connection with our trust preferred securities offering 
the company also has a million line of credit that could be utilized to provide additional capital for the bank if deemed necessary 
the holding company and capitalbank exceeded the federal reserve s fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december    and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  we would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities we serve 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
our loans to assets ratio increased from to and our loans to funds ratio increased from to the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank were approximately million at december  compared to million at december  we expect to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
additionally  we had approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases and million of securities available for sale at december  as sources of liquidity 
we have million available in a revolving line of credit with another bank 
we also have the ability to receive an additional million in advances under the term of our agreement with the federal home loan bank 
we depend on dividends from capitalbank as our primary source of liquidity 
the ability of capitalbank to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions that may  but are not expected to  have a material impact on the liquidity available to us 
we paid stock dividends in september  june  and may and may do so in the future 
we have paid cash dividends on a quarterly basis since september and anticipate continuing to do so 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with such principals requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we  in conjunction with our independent auditors  have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed herein with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures herein 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
of these significant accounting policies  we consider our policies regarding the accounting for the allowance  benefit plans  mortgage servicing rights  accounting for past acquisitions  and income taxes  to be the most critical accounting policies due to the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires a significant degree of judgment that could be subject to revision as newer information becomes available 
in order to determine our critical accounting policies  we consider whether the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
the allowance represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
see provision and allowance for losses for additional discussion including factors impacting the allowance and the methodology for analyzing the adequacy of the allowance 
this methodology relies upon our judgment 
our judgments is based on an assessment of critical accounting policies continued various issues  including  but not limited to  the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  the risk management system relating to lending activities  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
we consider the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio 
however  our judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about current events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances  will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely impacting the results of operations of the company 
we have increased our market share through bank and branch acquisitions the last of these acquisitions occurred in 
these acquisitions resulted in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these tests  which we performed as of june  and  use estimates in their calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as is the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
we test for goodwill impairment by determining the fair market value for each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair market value  the potential for impairment exists  and a second step of impairment testing is performed 
in the second step  the implied fair market value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair market value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
if the implied fair market value of reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its fair market value 
the valuations as of june  indicated that no impairment charge was required as of that date  and we are not aware of any reason that a material change will occur in the future 
we use assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
we exercise considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are reevaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by us or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the united states tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service 
we are subject to potential adverse adjustments  including  but not limited to  an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
historically  our estimated income taxes have been materially correct  and we are not aware of any reason that a material change will occur in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein that summarizes current period income tax expense as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
non gaap financial information this report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
we use these non gaap measures to analyze performance 
such disclosures include  but are not limited to  certain designated net interest income amounts presented on a tax equivalent basis 
we believe that the presentation of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis aids in the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap measures  and furthermore  our non gaap measures may not necessarily be comparable to non gaap performance measures of other companies 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as our subsidiary and ours are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
impact of off balance sheet instruments we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer at predetermined interest rates as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual amount of the instrument 
because certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as other lending facilities 
standby letters of credit often expire without being used 
we use the same credit underwriting procedures for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for our on balance sheet instruments 
the credit worthiness of each borrower is evaluated and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
through its operations  capitalbank has made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to capitalbank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   capitalbank had issued commitments to extend credit of million and standby letters of credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements 
approximately million of these commitments to extend credit had variable rates 
our experience has been that a significant portion of these commitments often expire without being used 
the following table sets forth the length of time until maturity for unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at december  after one after three through through greater within one three twelve within one than dollars in thousands month months months year one year total unused commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit totals the bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plants  equipment and commercial and residential real estate 
industry developments as more fully discussed under the heading government supervision and regulation in item of this annual report  in november of  the gramm leach bliley act  previously known as the financial services modernization act of  was enacted 
the act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  the act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that we face from larger institutions and other types of companies 
we cannot predict the full effect that the act will have on us 
from time to time  various bills are introduced in the united states congress with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry 
we cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  how these proposals would affect us 
contractual obligations we utilize a variety of short term and long term borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to assist in meeting deposit withdrawal requirements  and to fund growth of interest earning assets in excess of traditional deposit growth 
repurchase agreements  federal home loan bank advances  and junior subordinate debentures serve as our primary sources of such funds 
obligations under noncancelable operating lease agreements are payable over several years with the longest obligation expiring in we do not feel that any existing noncancelable operating lease agreements are likely to materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in an adverse way 
contractual obligations relative to these agreements are noted in the table below 
option periods that we have not yet exercised are not included in this analysis as they do not represent contractual obligations until exercised

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit  and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to other risks that we manage in the normal course of business  such as credit quality and liquidity  management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could potentially have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in the section captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income is incorporated herein by reference 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities
