item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sale  purchase  ownership  and use of firearms are subject to thousands of federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the basic federal laws are the national firearms act  the federal firearms act  and the gun control act of these laws generally prohibit the private ownership of fully 
table of contents automatic weapons and place certain restrictions on the interstate sale of firearms unless certain licenses are obtained 
the company does not manufacture fully automatic weapons  other than for the law enforcement market  and holds all necessary licenses under these federal laws 
from time to time  congressional committees review proposed bills relating to the regulation of firearms 
these proposed bills generally seek either to restrict or ban the sale and  in some cases  the ownership of various types of firearms 
several states currently have laws in effect similar to the aforementioned legislation 
until november   the brady law mandated a nationwide five day waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun 
as of november   the national instant check system  which applies to both handguns and long guns  replaced the five day waiting period 
the company believes that the brady law and the national instant check system have not had a significant effect on the company s sales of firearms  nor does it anticipate any impact on sales in the future 
on september   the crime bill banned so called assault weapons 
all the company s then manufactured commercially sold long guns were exempted by name as legitimate sporting firearms 
this ban expired by operation of law on september  the company remains strongly opposed to laws which would restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to lawfully acquire firearms 
the company believes that the lawful private ownership of firearms is guaranteed by the second amendment to the united states constitution and that the widespread private ownership of firearms in the united states will continue 
however  there can be no assurance that the regulation of firearms will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
firearms litigation the following disclosures within firearms litigation are identical to the disclosures within firearms litigation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and footnote contingent liabilities 
as of december   the company is a defendant in approximately four lawsuits allegedly involving its products and is aware of certain other such claims 
lawsuits and claims fall into two categories i those that claim damages from the company related to allegedly defective product design which stem from a specific incident 
these lawsuits and claims are based principally on the theory of strict liability but also may be based on negligence  breach of warranty  and other legal theories  and ii those brought by cities  municipalities  counties  and individuals against firearms manufacturers  distributors and dealers seeking to recover damages allegedly arising out of the misuse of firearms by third parties in the commission of homicides  suicides and other shootings involving juveniles and adults 
the complaints by municipalities seek damages  among other things  for the costs of medical care  police and emergency services  public health services  and the maintenance of courts  prisons  and other services 
in certain instances  the plaintiffs seek to recover for decreases in property values and loss of business within the city due to criminal violence 
in addition  nuisance abatement and or injunctive relief is sought to change the design  manufacture  marketing and distribution practices of the various defendants 
these suits allege  among other claims  strict liability or negligence in the design of products  public nuisance  negligent entrustment  negligent distribution  deceptive or fraudulent advertising  violation of 
table of contents consumer protection statutes and conspiracy or concert of action theories 
most of these cases do not allege a specific injury to a specific individual as a result of the misuse or use of any of the company s products 
the company has expended significant amounts of financial resources and management time in connection with product liability litigation 
management believes that  in every case  the allegations are unfounded  and that the shootings and any results therefrom were due to negligence or misuse of the firearms by third parties or the claimant  and that there should be no recovery against the company 
defenses further exist to the suits brought by cities  municipalities  counties  and a state attorney general based  among other reasons  on established state law precluding recovery by municipalities for essential government services  the remoteness of the claims  the types of damages sought to be recovered  and limitations on the extraterritorial authority which may be exerted by a city  municipality  county or state under state and federal law  including state and federal constitutions 
also  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act signed into law on october  on its face requires dismissal of such claims 
the only case against the company alleging liability for criminal shootings by third parties to ever be permitted to go before a constitutional jury  hamilton  et al 
v 
accu tek  et al  resulted in a defense verdict in favor of the company on february  in that case  numerous firearms manufacturers and distributors had been sued  alleging damages as a result of alleged negligent sales practices and industry wide liability 
the company and its marketing and distribution practices were exonerated from any claims of negligence in each of the seven cases decided by the jury 
in subsequent proceedings involving other defendants  the new york court of appeals as a matter of law confirmed that no legal duty existed under the circumstances to prevent or investigate criminal misuses of a manufacturer s lawfully made products  and liability of firearms manufacturers could not be apportioned under a market share theory 
more recently  the new york court of appeals on october  declined to hear the appeal from the decision of the new york supreme court  appellate division  affirming the dismissal of new york attorney general eliot spitzer s public nuisance suit against the company and other manufacturers and distributors of firearms 
in its decision  the appellate division relied heavily on hamilton in concluding that it was legally inappropriate  impractical  unrealistic and unfair to attempt to hold firearms manufacturers responsible under theories of public nuisance for the criminal acts of others

the dismissal of the washington  dc municipal lawsuit was sustained on appeal  but individual plaintiffs were permitted to proceed to discovery and attempt to identify the manufacturers of the firearms used in their shootings as machine guns under the city s strict liability law 
on april   the dc court of appeals  in an en banc hearing  unanimously dismissed all negligence and public nuisance claims  but let stand individual claims based upon a washington  dc act imposing strict liability for manufacturers of machine guns 
based on present information  none of the company s products has been identified with any of the criminal assaults which form the basis of the individual claims 
the writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court regarding the constitutionality of the washington  dc act was denied and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings 
the defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the case based upon the protection of lawful commerce in arms act  which motion was granted on may  the individual plaintiffs and the district of columbia  which has subrogation claims in regard to the individual plaintiffs  have appealed 
the indiana court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the gary case by the trial court  but the indiana supreme court reversed this dismissal and remanded the case for discovery proceedings on december  gary is scheduled to begin trial in the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa 
the state court judge held the plcaa unconstitutional and the defendants filed a motion with the indiana court of appeals asking it to accept interlocutory appeal on the issue  which appeal was accepted on february  in the previously reported new york city municipal case  the defendants moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act 
the trial judge found the act to be constitutional but denied the defendants motion to dismiss the case  stating that the act was not applicable to the suit 
the defendants were given leave to appeal and in fact have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
that appeal is pending 
in the naacp case  on may   an advisory jury returned a verdict rejecting the naacp s claims 
on july   judge jack b 
weinstein entered an order dismissing the naacp lawsuit  but this order contained lengthy dicta which defendants believe are contrary to law and fact 
appeals by both sides were filed  but plaintiffs withdrew their appeal 
on august   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the naacp s motion to dismiss the defendants appeal of judge weinstein s order denying defendants motion to strike his dicta made in his order dismissing the naacp s case  and the defendants motion for summary disposition was denied as moot 
the ruling of the second circuit effectively confirmed the decision in favor of defendants and brought this matter to a conclusion 
legislation has been passed in approximately states precluding suits of the type brought by the municipalities mentioned above 
on the federal level  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act was signed by president bush on october  the act requires dismissal of suits against manufacturers arising out of the lawful sale of their products for harm resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm by a third party 
the company is pursuing dismissal of each action involving such claims  including the municipal cases described above 
on february   plaintiff s counsel in the previously reported arnold case advised that plaintiff intends to voluntarily dismiss the case with prejudice 
this will conclude this matter with no payment by the company 

table of contents punitive damages  as well as compensatory damages  are commonly demanded in many of the lawsuits and claims brought against the company 
aggregate claimed amounts may exceed product liability accruals and applicable insurance coverage 
for claims made after july   coverage is provided on an annual basis for losses exceeding million per claim  or an aggregate maximum loss of million annually  except for certain new claims which might be brought by governments or municipalities after july   which are excluded from coverage 
product liability claim payments are made when appropriate if  as  and when claimants and the company reach agreement upon an amount to finally resolve all claims 
legal costs are paid as the lawsuits and claims develop  the timing of which may vary greatly from case to case 
a time schedule cannot be determined in advance with any reliability concerning when payments will be made in any given case 
provision is made for product liability claims based upon many factors related to the severity of the alleged injury and potential liability exposure  based upon prior claim experience 
because our experience in defending these lawsuits and claims is that unfavorable outcomes are typically not probable or estimable  only in rare cases is an accrual established for such costs 
in most cases  an accrual is established only for estimated legal defense costs 
product liability accruals are periodically reviewed to reflect then current estimates of possible liabilities and expenses incurred to date and reasonably anticipated in the future 
threatened product liability claims are reflected in our product liability accrual on the same basis as actual claims  ie  an accrual is made for reasonably anticipated possible liability and claims handling expenses on an ongoing basis 
a range of reasonably possible loss relating to unfavorable outcomes cannot be made 
currently  there are no product liability cases in which a dollar amount of damages is claimed 
if there were cases with claimed damages  the amount of damages claimed would be set forth as an indication of possible maximum liability that the company might be required to incur in these cases regardless of the likelihood or reasonable probability of any or all of this amount being awarded to claimants as a result of adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal 
as of december  and  the company was a defendant in and lawsuits  respectively  involving its products and is aware of other such claims 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  and claims were filed against the company  and claims were dismissed  and and claims were settled 
the average cost per settled claim was  and  in and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
the company monitors the status of known claims and the product liability accrual  which includes amounts for asserted and unasserted claims 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with special and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period

the company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the united states 
substantially all sales are domestic 
the company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors principally to the commercial sporting market 
investment castings are manufactured from titanium and steel alloys 
investment castings are sold either directly to or through manufacturers representatives to companies in a wide variety of industries 
in july  the company announced the cessation of titanium castings operations  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the company will consolidate its casting operations in its new hampshire foundry in the company continues to manufacture and sell steel investment castings for a wide variety of customers and end uses 
because many of the company s competitors are not subject to public filing requirements and industry wide data is generally not available in a timely manner  the company is unable to compare its performance to other companies or specific current industry trends 
instead  the company measures itself against its own historical results 
the company does not consider its overall firearms business to be predictably seasonal  however  sales of certain models of firearms are usually lower in the third quarter of the year 
results of operations year ended december   as compared to year ended december  sales consolidated net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from consolidated net sales of million 
firearms segment net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from firearm net sales of million 

table of contents firearms unit shipments increased in due to increased shipments of revolvers  partially offset by a decline in shipments of shotguns  pistols  and rifles 
the increase in revolver shipments for is due to greater availability of revolver models in stronger demand 
the decrease in shotgun shipments is due to decreased availability of the side by side shotgun  while the decrease in pistol shipments in appears to reflect a softening of demand as well as the shipment of  kpd pistols to the us army and tank automotive and armaments command in january of the decrease in rifle shipments is the result of an apparent softening of demand 
a modest price increase and a shift in product mix toward firearms with greater unit sales prices resulted in the greater percentage increase in sales than unit shipments 
effective january   the company instituted a unilateral minimum distributor resale price policy for its firearms which remains in effect 
this change in policy does not appear to have had an adverse effect on the company s firearm sales 
casting segment net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from casting sales of million 
the casting sales increase was due primarily to the acceleration of titanium shipments related to the cessation of titanium casting operations  as previously announced by the company in july shipments of titanium castings are expected to conclude in the first quarter of titanium casting sales accounted for million or of casting sales in the company continues to manufacture and sell steel investment castings for a wide variety of customers and end uses 
cost of products sold and gross margin consolidated cost of products sold was million in this represents an increase of million or from consolidated cost of products sold of million 
the gross margin as a percent of sales was in this represents a decline from the gross margin of as illustrated below december  net sales total cost of products sold  before lifo and overhead rate inventory adjustments and product liability note gross margin before lifo and overhead rate inventory adjustments and product liability lifo and overhead rate inventory adjustments and product liability note gross margin 
table of contents note gross margin before inventory adjustments and product liability was favorably impacted by stronger sales  and was adversely impacted by an excess and obsolete inventory charge of million  compared to million in the impact of the excess and obsolete inventory charge was of sales in as compared to of sales in note gross margin was favorably impacted by a lifo liquidation of million and a reduction in product liability of million  and was adversely impacted by a reduction in inventory value of million related to overhead rate changes 
excess and obsolete inventory in prior years  the company received one cancelable annual order in december from each of its distributors 
effective december  the company changed the manner in which distributors order firearms  and began receiving firm  non cancelable purchase orders on a frequent basis  with most orders for immediate delivery 
in the past  the company adjusted production schedules to consume on hand raw material and wip inventories  regardless of customer demand for the finished goods so produced 
this practice led to increased investment in inventory  and an unbalanced finished goods inventory 
consistent with the change in the manner in which distributors order from the company  the company significantly changed its production scheduling philosophy from an annual production cycle to a customer demand pull system in the fourth quarter of under the company s new system  production is driven solely by customer demand 
the company is committed to producing the firearms demanded by its customers and does not alter its production mix to achieve the short sighted goal of producing finished goods in excess of customer requirements for the purpose of consuming excess or slow moving raw material and wip parts  components  or subassemblies  or absorbing overhead expense 
this change to a customer demand pull system should result in a better match between production and customer demand and is likely to result in further reduction in inventories 
as a result of this new production philosophy  it is apparent the company has inventory in excess of its needs over the foreseeable future 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  the company concluded that it was not prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore the company evaluated the adequacy of the excess and obsolescence inventory reserve and concluded that additional reserves were required to reflect the estimated recoverable value of excess inventories below lifo carrying cost 
the required reserve was estimated based on the following parameters  and resulted in an excess and obsolete expense of million and a reserve balance of million projected year required of consumption reserve and thereafter 
table of contents lifo during  gross inventories were reduced by million 
this reduction resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs that prevailed in prior years as compared with the current cost of purchases  the effect of which decreased costs of products sold by approximately million 
there was no lifo liquidation in the table below summarizes estimated lifo impacts on the cost of products sold if further inventory reduction is realized  which represent potential lifo liquidation amounts partially offset by estimated lifo expenses 
this is the amount by which costs of products sold might decrease and operating profit might increase in these estimates are based on potential levels of inventory reduction and possible lifo indices in thousands estimated lifo index range inventory reduction million million million reduction in inventory will generate positive cash flow for the company  partially offset by the tax impact of a lifo liquidation  which will generate negative cash flow as it creates taxable income  resulting in higher tax payments 
product liability during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
see footnote contingent liabilities for further discussion of the company s product liability 
overhead rate change the change in inventory value in was a reduction of million  which recognized progress made in lowering overhead rates during the change in inventory value in was an increase of million  which recognized increasing overhead rates in the impact of the change in inventory value on gross margin was of sales in as compared to of sales in the year over year impact of overhead rate changes on gross margin was a reduction of gross margin of million  or of sales 
fourth quarter charges in the fourth quarter of  a million non cash inventory valuation adjustment  net of the lifo impact  was recorded to recognize inefficiencies in labor and overhead during a period of rapid inventory reduction as the company converted to a manufacturing system that emphasizes continuous improvement in customer service  quality and productivity 
this over absorption of labor and overhead was quantified by a physical inventory taken in the fourth quarter 
due to the timing of the physical inventory  the company was unable to quantify the impact of this delayed recognition of labor and overhead efficiencies  if any  on the financial results of prior quarters 
as a consequence  raw material and work in process physical inventories are being performed at the end of each quarter until a permanent corrective action is established and determined to be adequate  making these physical inventories unnecessary 
the asset impairment charge of million relates primarily to certain underutilized non manufacturing real property assets whose net book value exceeds current market value 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million in this represents a decrease of million or from selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
the decrease reflects a reduction in advertising and sales promotion expenses  partially offset by increased personnel related expenses including million related to the retirement of the former chairman and chief executive officer 
other income other income net was million in this represents an increase of million from other income net of million 
the increase is attributable to the gain on the sale of excess casting machinery and equipment and the sale of certain non manufacturing real estate in income taxes and net income the effective income tax rate of in remained consistent with the income tax rate in as a result of the foregoing factors  consolidated net income was million in this represents an increase of million or from consolidated net income of million

firearms unit shipments for increased from  as the increase in shipments of pistols and shotguns was largely offset by the decline in shipments of rifles and revolvers 
the increase in pistol shipments in is attributable to the new mark iii pistols and the p centerfire pistols 
in  rifle shipments benefited from the popularity of the th anniversary carbine  which was available only in a modest price increase and a change in mix from lower priced products to higher priced resulted in the greater increase in sales versus unit shipments 
in  the company offered a sales incentive program for its distributors which allowed them to earn rebates of up to if certain annual overall sales targets were achieved 
this program replaced a similar sales incentive program in effective january   the company instituted a unilateral minimum distributor resale price policy for its firearms 
casting segment net sales increased to million in from million in as a result of higher unit volume 
increased sales were generated from existing customers as well as several new customers in  in a variety of industries 
consolidated cost of products sold for was million compared to million in  representing and increase of 
this increase of million was primarily attributable to increased sales  and increased unitary overhead expenses resulting from a reduction in firearm production volume  and increased product liability costs 

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in this deterioration was caused by less efficient firearms production due to lower rates of firearm production  increased product liability expenses  and was partially offset by more efficient production in the castings segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due principally to severance costs associated with several employee actions taken predominantly in the fourth quarter of total other income decreased from million in to million in included in total other income in was a million gain from the sale of the property and building that housed the company s uni cast division prior to its sale in the company s earnings on short term investments increased in as a result of more favorable interest rates  partially offset by reduced principal

the company s working capital of million  less the lifo reserve of million  results in working capital of million and a current ratio of to cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided in compared to is principally a result of a decrease in inventory and various fluctuations in operating asset and liability accounts during compared to the increase in cash provided by operations in compared to is primarily attributable to the decrease in inventories and trade receivables in compared to an increase in inventories and receivables in  partially offset by the decline in net income 
third parties supply the company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings  such as fabricated steel components  walnut  birch  beech  maple and laminated lumber for rifle and shotgun stocks  wax  ceramic material  metal alloys  various synthetic products and other component parts 
there is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors 
the company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory to provide ample time to locate and obtain additional items at then current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations 
however  if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained  the company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

the program allows the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
there were no dividends paid in the payment of future dividends depends on many factors  including internal estimates of future performance  then current cash and short term investments  and the company s need for funds 
the company does not expect to pay dividends in the near term  but will reconsider a dividend later in historically  the company has not required external financing 
based on its unencumbered assets  the company believes it has the ability to raise substantial amounts of cash through issuance of short term or long term debt

these proposed bills generally seek either to restrict or ban the sale and  in some cases  the ownership of various types of firearms 
several states currently have laws in effect similar to the aforementioned legislation 
until november   the brady law mandated a nationwide five day waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun 
as of november   the national instant check system  which applies to both handguns and long guns  replaced the five day waiting period 
the company believes that the brady law and the national instant check system have not had a significant effect on the company s sales of firearms  nor does it anticipate any impact on sales in the future 
on september   the crime bill banned so called assault weapons 
all the company s then manufactured commercially sold long guns were exempted by name as legitimate sporting firearms 
this ban expired by operation of law on september  the company remains strongly opposed to laws which would restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to lawfully acquire firearms 
the company believes that the lawful private ownership of firearms is guaranteed by the second amendment to the united states constitution and that the widespread private ownership of firearms in the united states will continue 
however  there can be no assurance that the regulation of firearms will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the company

table of contents as of december   the company is a defendant in approximately four lawsuits allegedly involving its products and is aware of certain other such claims 
lawsuits and claims fall into two categories i those that claim damages from the company related to allegedly defective product design which stem from a specific incident 
these lawsuits and claims are based principally on the theory of strict liability but also may be based on negligence  breach of warranty  and other legal theories  and ii those brought by cities  municipalities  counties  and individuals against firearms manufacturers  distributors and dealers seeking to recover damages allegedly arising out of the misuse of firearms by third parties in the commission of homicides  suicides and other shootings involving juveniles and adults 
the complaints by municipalities seek damages  among other things  for the costs of medical care  police and emergency services  public health services  and the maintenance of courts  prisons  and other services 
in certain instances  the plaintiffs seek to recover for decreases in property values and loss of business within the city due to criminal violence 
in addition  nuisance abatement and or injunctive relief is sought to change the design  manufacture  marketing and distribution practices of the various defendants 
these suits allege  among other claims  strict liability or negligence in the design of products  public nuisance  negligent entrustment  negligent distribution  deceptive or fraudulent advertising  violation of consumer protection statutes and conspiracy or concert of action theories 
most of these cases do not allege a specific injury to a specific individual as a result of the misuse or use of any of the company s products 
the company has expended significant amounts of financial resources and management time in connection with product liability litigation 
management believes that  in every case  the allegations are unfounded  and that the shootings and any results therefrom were due to negligence or misuse of the firearms by third parties or the claimant  and that there should be no recovery against the company 
defenses further exist to the suits brought by cities  municipalities  counties  and a state attorney general based  among other reasons  on established state law precluding recovery by municipalities for essential government services  the remoteness of the claims  the types of damages sought to be recovered  and limitations on the extraterritorial authority which may be exerted by a city  municipality  county or state under state and federal law  including state and federal constitutions 
also  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act signed into law on october  on its face requires dismissal of such claims 
the only case against the company alleging liability for criminal shootings by third parties to ever be permitted to go before a constitutional jury  hamilton  et al 
v 
accu tek  et al  resulted in a defense verdict in favor of the company on february  in that case  numerous firearms manufacturers and distributors had been sued  alleging damages as a result of alleged negligent sales practices and industry wide liability 
the company and its marketing and distribution practices were exonerated from any claims of negligence in each of the seven cases decided by the jury 
in subsequent proceedings involving other defendants  the new york court of appeals as a matter of law confirmed that no legal duty existed under the circumstances to prevent or investigate criminal misuses of a manufacturer s lawfully made products  and liability of firearms manufacturers could not be apportioned under a market share theory 
more recently  the new york court of appeals on october  declined to hear the appeal from the decision of the new york supreme court  appellate division  affirming the dismissal of new york attorney general eliot spitzer s public nuisance suit against the 
table of contents company and other manufacturers and distributors of firearms 
in its decision  the appellate division relied heavily on hamilton in concluding that it was legally inappropriate  impractical  unrealistic and unfair to attempt to hold firearms manufacturers responsible under theories of public nuisance for the criminal acts of others

the dismissal of the washington  dc municipal lawsuit was sustained on appeal  but individual plaintiffs were permitted to proceed to discovery and attempt to identify the manufacturers of the firearms used in their shootings as machine guns under the city s strict liability law 
on april   the dc court of appeals  in an en banc hearing  unanimously dismissed all negligence and public nuisance claims  but let stand individual claims based upon a washington  dc act imposing strict liability for manufacturers of machine guns 
based on present information  none of the company s products has been identified with any of the criminal assaults which form the basis of the individual claims 
the writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court regarding the constitutionality of the washington  dc act was denied and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings 
the defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the case based upon the protection of lawful commerce in arms act  which motion was granted on may  the individual plaintiffs and the district of columbia  which has subrogation claims in regard to the individual plaintiffs  have appealed 
the indiana court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the gary case by the trial court  but the indiana supreme court reversed this dismissal and remanded the case for discovery proceedings on december  gary is scheduled to begin trial in the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa 
the state court judge held the plcaa unconstitutional and the defendants filed a motion with the indiana court of appeals asking it to accept interlocutory appeal on the issue  which appeal was accepted on february  in the previously reported new york city municipal case  the defendants moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act 
the trial judge found the act to be constitutional but denied the defendants motion to dismiss the case  stating that the act was not 
table of contents applicable to the suit 
the defendants were given leave to appeal and in fact have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
that appeal is pending 
in the naacp case  on may   an advisory jury returned a verdict rejecting the naacp s claims 
on july   judge jack b 
weinstein entered an order dismissing the naacp lawsuit  but this order contained lengthy dicta which defendants believe are contrary to law and fact 
appeals by both sides were filed  but plaintiffs withdrew their appeal 
on august   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the naacp s motion to dismiss the defendants appeal of judge weinstein s order denying defendants motion to strike his dicta made in his order dismissing the naacp s case  and the defendants motion for summary disposition was denied as moot 
the ruling of the second circuit effectively confirmed the decision in favor of defendants and brought this matter to a conclusion 
legislation has been passed in approximately states precluding suits of the type brought by the municipalities mentioned above 
on the federal level  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act was signed by president bush on october  the act requires dismissal of suits against manufacturers arising out of the lawful sale of their products for harm resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm by a third party 
the company is pursuing dismissal of each action involving such claims  including the municipal cases described above 
on february   plaintiff s counsel in the previously reported arnold case advised that plaintiff intends to voluntarily dismiss the case with prejudice 
this will conclude this matter with no payment by the company 
punitive damages  as well as compensatory damages  are commonly demanded in many of the lawsuits and claims brought against the company 
aggregate claimed amounts may exceed product liability accruals and applicable insurance coverage 
for claims made after july   coverage is provided on an annual basis for losses exceeding million per claim  or an aggregate maximum loss of million annually  except for certain new claims which might be brought by governments or municipalities after july   which are excluded from coverage 
product liability claim payments are made when appropriate if  as  and when claimants and the company reach agreement upon an amount to finally resolve all claims 
legal costs are paid as the lawsuits and claims develop  the timing of which may vary greatly from case to case 
a time schedule cannot be determined in advance with any reliability concerning when payments will be made in any given case 
provision is made for product liability claims based upon many factors related to the severity of the alleged injury and potential liability exposure  based upon prior claim experience 
because our experience in defending these lawsuits and claims is that unfavorable outcomes are typically not probable or estimable  only in rare cases is an accrual established for such costs 
in most cases  an accrual is established only for estimated legal defense costs 
product liability accruals are periodically reviewed to reflect then current estimates of possible liabilities and expenses incurred to date and reasonably anticipated in the future 
threatened product liability claims are reflected in our product liability accrual on the same basis as actual claims  ie  an accrual is made for reasonably anticipated possible liability and claims handling expenses on an ongoing basis 
a range of reasonably possible loss relating to unfavorable outcomes cannot be made 
currently  there are no product liability cases in which a dollar amount of damages is claimed 
if there were cases with claimed damages  the amount of damages claimed would be set forth as an indication of possible 
table of contents maximum liability that the company might be required to incur in these cases regardless of the likelihood or reasonable probability of any or all of this amount being awarded to claimants as a result of adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal 
as of december  and  the company was a defendant in and lawsuits  respectively  involving its products and is aware of other such claims 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  and claims were filed against the company  and claims were dismissed  and and claims were settled 
the average cost per settled claim was  and  in and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
the company monitors the status of known claims and the product liability accrual  which includes amounts for asserted and unasserted claims 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with special and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period

there were no insurance recoveries during any of the above years 
other operational matters in the normal course of its manufacturing operations  the company is subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal  air emissions and water discharges into the environment 
the company believes that it is generally in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and the outcome of such proceedings and orders will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company self insures a significant amount of its product liability  workers compensation  medical  and other insurance 
it also carries significant deductible amounts on various insurance policies 
the valuation of the future defined benefit pension obligations at december  and indicated that these plans were underfunded by million and million  respectively  and resulted in a cumulative other comprehensive loss of million and million on the company s balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
the company expects to realize its deferred tax assets through tax deductions against future taxable income or carry back against taxes previously paid 
inflation s effect on the company s operations is most immediately felt in cost of products sold because the company values inventory on the lifo basis 
generally under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs  and thus  reduces distortion in 
table of contents reported income which would result from the slower recognition of increased costs when other methods are used 
in  however  the significant reduction in inventories resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the current cost of purchases 
this liquidation resulted in a reduction in costs of products sold by approximately million in there was no lifo liquidation in or critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
the company bases estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions  including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel  when applicable  that are believed to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy 
the company s management reviews every lawsuit and claim at the outset and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis 
the provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors  which vary for each case 
these factors include the type of claim  nature and extent of injuries  historical settlement ranges  jurisdiction where filed  and advice of counsel 
an accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim  when appropriate  based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim 
amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the company becomes aware that a claim or  in some instances a threat of claim  has been made when potential losses or costs of defense can be reasonably estimated 
such amounts are determined based on the company s experience in defending similar claims 
occasionally  charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  exceed amounts already provided 
likewise credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  are less than amounts previously provided 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with independent and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period 
the company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost  principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time 
the company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  it does not seem prudent nor supportable to carry 
table of contents inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore  the company estimates its excess and obsolescence inventory reserve based on the following parameters projected year required of consumption reserve and thereafter recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition

forward looking statements and projections the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements and projections concerning future expectations 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties  such as market demand  sales levels of firearms  anticipated castings sales and earnings  the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures  the results of pending litigation against the company including lawsuits filed by mayors  state attorneys general and other governmental entities and membership organizations  and the impact of future firearms control and

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changing interest rates on its investments  which consists primarily of united states treasury instruments with short term less than one year maturities and cash 
the interest rate market risk implicit in the company s investments at any given time is low  as the investments mature within short periods and the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash 
the company has not undertaken any actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investments
