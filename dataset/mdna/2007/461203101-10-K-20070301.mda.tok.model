debt finance charges  interest and fees associated with debt refinancing 
as previously disclosed in the company s form q for the quarter ended september   in november  the company determined that it was in violation of a financial covenant contained in three note purchase agreements between the company and various institutional lenders the note purchase agreements 
the note purchase agreements related to an aggregate principal amount of million in long term debt of the company 
the financial covenant limited the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated operating cash flow 
the company believes the limits were exceeded as a result of borrowings by the company in early october  under its million credit facility dated january  with various banks the credit facility 
the violation of the covenant under the note purchase agreements also may have constituted a default under both the credit facility and the company s separate million trade receivables securitization facility 
the company obtained waivers of the covenant violation from each of its lenders through february  on february   the company closed on its new financing facilities and replaced all existing debt facilities 
fees incurred during associated with the waivers of the covenant violation totaled asset write downs related to goodwill and other intangibles 
as previously disclosed in the company s september  form q  the company undertakes its annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in connection with the preparation of its fourth quarter results each year 
as a result of the reduced profitability of its na hme operating segment  and uncertainty associated with future market conditions  the company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of this segment of  the company is in process of finalizing the i 
table of contents underlying valuation associated with this charge in accordance with sfas no 
 however  based on the information known at this time  this is the company s best estimate of the impairment 
the impairment of goodwill in the na hme operating segment was primarily the result of reduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies  which negatively affected revenues and profitability in the na hme operating segment 
during  changes announced by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  affected eligibility  documentation  codes  and payment rules relating to power wheelchairs 
these changes impacted the predictability of reimbursement of expenses for and access to power wheelchairs  created uncertainty in the market place  and thus had a negative impact on na hme s revenues and related earnings 
effective november   cms reduced the maximum reimbursement amount for power wheelchairs under medicare by up to 
the reduced reimbursement levels may cause consumers to choose less expensive versions of the company s power wheelchairs 
na hme sales of respiratory products were also negatively affected by the changes in small and independent provider sales declined as these dealers slowed their purchases of the company s homefill tm oxygen system product line  in part  until they had a clearer view of future oxygen reimbursement levels 
furthermore  a study issued by the office of inspector general or oig  in september suggested that billion in savings could be achieved over five years by reducing the reimbursed rental period from three years the reimbursement period under current law to months 
the uncertainty created by these announcements continues to negatively impact the home oxygen equipment market  particularly for those providers considering changing to the homefill tm oxygen system 
medicare will also institute a new competitive bidding program for various items in ten as yet unidentified of the largest metropolitan areas late in this program is designed to reduce medicare payment levels for items that the medicare program spends the most money on under the home medical equipment benefit 
this new program will likely eliminate some providers from the competitive bidding markets  because only those providers who are chosen to participate based largely on price will be able to provide beneficiaries with items included in the bid 
medicare will be expanding the program to an additional metropolitan areas in the impact of the above reimbursement changes were taken into consideration in reviewing the profitability of the company s na hme operating segment and in evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangibles

income taxes as part of the process of preparing its financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating the company s current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies
