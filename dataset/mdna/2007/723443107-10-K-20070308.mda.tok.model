item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook to better understand our outlook for  the following should be read in conjunction with item a 
risk factors and the liquidity and capital resources section of this item  both in this annual report on form k 
on december   we announced that we had agreed to the terms of an amended asa with northwest  to become effective january   and an assumption and claims resolution agreement the assumption agreement that provides for northwest to assume our amended asa as part of northwest s plan of reorganization 
the agreement provides  among other things  that pinnacle will continue to have a long term relationship with northwest through at least  and added aircraft to our existing fleet of crjs 
the assumption agreement and amended asa also settles certain corporate governance issues and provides that we will receive an allowed unsecured claim of million subject to adjustment in certain circumstances in northwest s bankruptcy proceedings in settlement of all pre petition claims that pinnacle has against northwest 
the amended asa removed all restrictions preventing us from using our wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle airlines  inc  to provide regional airline services to other major airlines  with the exception of operating flights into or out of northwest s hub cities of minneapolis st 
paul  detroit  and memphis 
we can now also operate aircraft with seating capacities of seats  or such other size that does not cause northwest to violate its collective bargaining agreement with its pilots union 
soon after we announced the amended asa  we completed the acquisition of colgan air  inc colgan operates turboprop regional aircraft as continental connection  united express and us airways express 
launched in as a family owned and operated company  today colgan offers daily flights to cities in states 
colgan operates saab and beech d regional aircraft  and has hub operations in boston  houston  new york  pittsburgh and washington  dc colgan employs approximately  people and transported nearly million customers in in colgan had revenues of approximately million 
colgan will have revenues of approximately million in with the acquisition of colgan  pinnacle airlines corp 
will have two operating entities with independent management structures 
pinnacle airlines  inc will continue to be headquartered in memphis  tennessee and operate its fleet of crj regional jet aircraft on behalf of northwest airlines 
colgan will maintain its operational headquarters in manassas  virginia  provided that location continues to be the optimal operational and financial structure for the organization 
since successfully concluding negotiations for an amended asa with northwest  our prospects for growth with other major airlines have improved significantly 
with the assignment of million of our claim against northwest for net proceeds of approximately million  we now have the financial resources to provide aircraft to major airline partners under capacity purchase agreements 
in addition  now that substantially all of the restrictions preventing us from operating on behalf of other major airlines have been removed  a number of major airlines have shown interest in entering into long term relationships with us 
on february   we entered into a new capacity purchase agreement with continental airlines  inc under which colgan will operate seat bombardier q regional aircraft as a continental connection carrier 
the aircraft will operate primarily out of the continental hub at newark liberty international airport 
in connection with this capacity purchase agreement  we entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with bombardier  inc to purchase up to firm and option q aircraft 
we believe that other major airlines will desire to add the q aircraft to their networks to take advantage of the superior unit operating costs and performance advantages 
the q can operate with lower unit costs than a seat regional jet on shorter stage lengths 
in addition  the cabin is more spacious  providing more passenger comfort 
the q contains advanced noise and vibration canceling technology that further enhances the customer experience 
in addition  the q has operating capabilities that allow it to utilize certain runways that cannot be utilized by a regional jet under certain conditions 
we expect to make the q aircraft a major component of our colgan subsidiary s operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we intend to use pinnacle as our growth platform for regional jet operations and colgan as our growth platform for regional turboprop operations 
with both platforms  we now have a broad spectrum of regional airline product offerings for our customers 
we will seek additional capacity purchase agreement opportunities with major airlines on economic terms that provide positive returns for our shareholders 
the collective bargaining agreement between pinnacle and alpa became amendable in april we have been actively negotiating with alpa for the past several months 
in august  we filed for mediation with the national mediation board 
since that time  we have met with the mediator assigned to our case and with alpa  but we have not reached resolution on an amended collective bargaining agreement 
under our amended asa  northwest will have the ongoing option to remove of our aircraft at a rate of three per month if we do not reach an agreement with alpa prior to march  we continue to meet with alpa with the intent of negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement prior to the march  deadline 
the company is currently under irs audit for the tax years through the company believes that it has provided sufficient reserves for exposure areas 
however  the company s future earnings  cash flow and liquidity could be materially impacted should the irs ultimately prevail on significant adjustments  if any  arising as a result of its audit 
settlement of this audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations on the assessment of income taxes for any tax year may also result in a change in future tax provisions 
certain statistical information the following tables present our operating expenses per block hour and operating expenses per available seat mile

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
as discussed in item  business our airline services agreement with northwest  our amended asa provides a monthly margin payment calculated to achieve a target operating margin  based on reimbursement payments and payments based on pre set rates 
we recognize revenue when services are provided 
the monthly margin payment plus total reimbursement payments and payments based on pre set rates are recognized as revenue at the gross amount billed 
as the payments based on pre set rates are not based on the actual expenses incurred  our actual annual unadjusted operating margin may fall outside the then applicable floor or ceiling stipulated in the amended asa 
the amended asa provides for a year end adjustment to bring our operating margin to the applicable floor or ceiling 
for the years ended december   and  no margin adjustment payments were required 
any penalties we incur in providing regional airline services to northwest are treated as reductions in revenue 
income tax reserves 
our reserves are based on management s assessment of an issue s resolution  based on the facts  history of how the issue has been treated  and existing case law  and reserved based on management s estimate of the expected outcome of an issue 
we believe that we have recorded reserves that are appropriate for each identified issue 
the company s future earnings  cash flow and liquidity could be materially impacted should the irs prevail on significant adjustments proposed  if any  arising as a result of its current audit 
for further discussion  refer to note  income taxes  in item of this form k 
goodwill and contractual rights 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of and determined that neither of our intangible assets were impaired as of december  goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology and includes management s assumptions on revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates and expected capital expenditures 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  the company performs its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
the company evaluates whether there has been an impairment of its contractual rights if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of its contractual rights is not recoverable undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value and exceeds its fair value 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the carrying value of its contractual rights is reduced to its fair value 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations spare parts 
expendable spare parts and maintenance supplies are recorded as inventory when they are purchased and we charge the costs to operations as this inventory is used 
an allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining estimated useful life of the related aircraft equipment  for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as obsolete or excess 
we will continue to modify these estimates as our crj fleet ages 
estimated losses on subleased aircraft 
we provide for estimated losses on subleased aircraft and equipment based on the difference between our discounted cash obligations under our original lease agreements and the discounted net cash inflows that we expect to receive under sublease agreements 
in estimating net cash inflows  we consider the costs necessary to maintain the aircraft and equipment in a condition suitable for sublease and the monthly rental payments we reasonably expect under the sublease agreements  which considers current estimates of market rental rates 
our estimated losses on subleased aircraft are reduced by any amounts we reasonably expect to recover  through legal proceedings or negotiations  from original sublessees 
we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and the estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment after giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
management has discussed the development of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them

other revenues have primarily consisted of ground handling services that we provide to northwest  mesaba  and other carriers at certain airports 
revenue from ground handling services accounted for approximately of our total revenues in we will continue to account for our ground handling services in other revenues 
a significant portion of the payments we receive from northwest are based on the actual operation of our aircraft 
northwest is solely responsible for scheduling flights  and the amended asa does not require northwest to meet any minimum utilization levels for our aircraft 
as noted in the discussion of our amended asa  we receive reimbursement of certain operating expenses necessary to provide regional airline capacity to northwest and payments based on pre set rates for fixed costs  completed block hours and completed cycles 
we also receive margin payments on these items which are intended to achieve a target operating margin 
consequently  our operating results are not significantly impacted by any seasonality trends historically associated with the airline industry 
our net income for the year ended december  was million 
this includes a benefit for the year  net of tax  of million  associated with the bankruptcies of northwest and mesaba discussed above  a charge of million for additional income tax provisions  and a million after tax charge for pilot post retirement benefits that occurred in the second quarter

the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease of million in revenue associated with expense reimbursements 
the most significant decreases in reimbursable expenses  primarily aircraft rent  other rentals and landing fees  aircraft fuel and ground handling services provided by northwest  were caused by a decreased average fleet size in during  crj aircraft were added  although of these aircraft were removed from the fleet effective november  we continued to receive fixed payments on these aircraft through november  the decrease in revenue from expense reimbursements and an additional decrease of million associated with our decreased level of flying are partially offset by an asa rate increase that increased revenue by million for the year ended december  regional airline services revenue per block hour for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  which represents an increase of approximately 
regional airline services revenue per cycle increased by from  to  the variances in revenue per block hour and cycle are due primarily to an decrease in the average length of our flights of over the same periods 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased by million and 
the decrease in operating expenses during was primarily due to the previously discussed benefit of million and losses of million associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba for the year ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the benefits and losses due to bankruptcy filings  for the year ended december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses decreased by million and 
the decrease in operating expense was due primarily to the decreased average fleet size during salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in the average number of employees of  as well as wage rate and benefit increases 
the increase in employees is primarily due to an agreement we entered into with northwest during the fourth quarter of  under which we will provide our own ground handling services at seven additional cities under the amended asa where we had previously been handled by northwest 
in addition  we agreed to provide ground handling services to northwest for its own flights at six additional cities under a separate agreement 
as part of this transition  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant hiring  training  and other startup costs and capital expenditures for ground equipment 
the company also recorded a million postretirement liability for pilots  of which million was related to prior periods  as discussed in note of item of this form k 
aircraft fuel expense decreased million  or  due to the decrease in block hours and the increase in cycles  which was caused by a decrease the average length of flights

effective january   our monthly lease rates were reduced to a market based rate 
under the amended asa  northwest reimburses in full aircraft rental expense 
ground handling services decreased by million  or  due primarily to an increase in the number of cities in which ground handling functions are performed by our employees rather than being outsourced 
the remaining decrease is attributable to a change in the mix of cities served 
however  this decrease in expense for ground handling services is offset by the increase in salaries and wages  as described above 
other expenses decreased by million and 
the decrease in unreimbursed other expenses was driven by our decreased level of operations  most notably a decrease of million of expenses associated with overnight travel for our pilots and flight attendants and million attributable to a decrease in professional service expenses 
our professional services expense included increased costs associated with state tax planning  the audit of our financial statements and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the process of obtaining our second air carrier certificate 
these costs decreased in as these projects did not require the same level of assistance from outside professionals

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments

the assignment of our claim is subject to federal and state income taxation  and we will be required to make estimated tax payments on this sale throughout the internal revenue service irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for years through the irs has focused on several key transactions that we undertook during those periods 
should the irs prevail on certain adjustments  if proposed  related to these areas  the impact on the company could be significant

we do not anticipate a significant amount of capital expenditures at our colgan subsidiary during other than expenditures that would be financed through third parties 
financing activities 
cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
this is due to the repayment of the entire amount of our borrowings under our line of credit

deferred tax liability 
in connection with the benefit to operating income associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba of million for  we recorded a deferred tax liability of million 
guarantees and indemnifications 
we are the guarantor of approximately million aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon 
these bonds were issued by the memphis shelby county airport authority the authority and are payable solely from our rentals paid under a long term lease agreement with the authority 
the leasing arrangement is accounted for as an operating lease in the consolidated financial statements 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our use of the leased premises 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our aircraft lease agreements with northwest  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements
