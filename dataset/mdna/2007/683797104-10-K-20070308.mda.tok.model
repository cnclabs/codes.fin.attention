oppenheimer s p s p tsx composite certain tax matters the following paragraphs summarize certain united states and canadian federal income tax considerations in connection with the receipt of dividends paid on the class a and class b shares of the company 
these tax considerations are stated in brief and general terms and are based on united states and canadian law currently in effect 
there are other potentially significant united states and canadian federal income tax considerations and state  provincial or local income tax considerations with respect to ownership and disposition of the class a and class b shares which are not discussed herein

critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these include cash equivalents  deposits with brokers and clearing organizations  securities owned  securities sold but not yet purchased  and stock loan stock borrow balances 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quot ed price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
the company s remaining financial instruments are generally short term in nature  and their carrying values approximate fair value  with the exception of notes receivable from employees  which are carried at cost 
securities owned  including those pledged and securities sold  but not yet purchased are recorded at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet using quoted market or dealer prices  where available  or third party pricing services 
gains and losses are recorded in principal transaction revenue on the consolidated statements of income 
investments  included in securities owned  which have a ready market are valued using quoted market or dealer prices 
investments with no ready market value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by management 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include available market prices  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results of the issuer  and other pertinent information 
management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these investments 
there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique 
the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of an amount that the company could realize in a current transaction 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuation  these estimated fair valu es do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and the differences could be material 
financial instruments used for asset and liabilities management are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon dealer quotes and third party pricing services 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk of its variable rate senior secured credit note 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the swap hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in month libor 
loans and allowances for doubtful accounts customer receivables  primarily consisting of margin loans collateralized by customer owned securities  are charged interest at rates similar to other such loans made throughout the industry 
customer receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts unsecured or partially secured receivables from customers and are fully reserved 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors as part of its hiring process 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
legal and regulatory reserves the company records reserves related to legal and regulatory proceedings in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  specifically in the case of client litigation  the amount of the loss in the client s account and the possibility of wrongdoing  if any  on the part of an employee of the company  the basis and validity of the claim  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal and regulatory proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded as a charge to results in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal or regulatory proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
intangible assets intangible assets arose upon the acquisition of the us private client and asset management divisions of cibc world markets inc the oppenheimer divisions and are comprised of customer relationships and trademarks and trade names 
customer relationships are carried at million which is net of accumulated amortization of million and are being amortized on a straight line basis over months commencing in january trademarks and trade names  carried at million  which are not amortized  are subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value is less than their carrying amount 
trademarks and trade names recorded as at december  have been tested for impairment and it has been determined that no impairment has occurred 
goodwill goodwill arose upon the acquisitions of oppenheimer  old michigan corp 
formerly first of michigan capital corporation  josephthal co 
inc  grand charter group incorporated and the oppenheimer divisions 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
goodwill recorded as at december  has been tested for impairment and it has been determined that no impairment has occurred 
stock based compensation plans the company estimates the fair value of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and applies to it a forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share based awards include the exercise price of the award  the expected term  the expected volatility of the company s class a shares over the term of the award  the risk free interest rate over the expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive share based awards 
income taxes the company estimates taxes payable and records income tax reserves 
these reserves are based on historic experience and may not reflect the ultimate liability 
the company monitors and adjusts these reserves as necessary 
changes in accounting policies effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment 
the company recorded additional compensation expense for the year ended december  of million with respect to its equity incentive plan 
in prior years  the cost of stock options was presented on a pro forma basis in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has always recorded compensation expense with respect to its other share based plans  although the method of computation of the expense has changed with the adoption of sfas r 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights which requires a general partner s or managing member s in the case of limited liability companies to consolidate its partnerships or to provide limited partners with rights to remove the general partner s or to terminate the partnership 
the company serves as a general partner for a number of asset management limited partnerships through oam and  therefore  was required to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
immediately for partnerships formed or modified after june  for partnerships formed on or before june  that were not modified  the company was required to adopt eitf issue no 
on january  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently issued in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires that a tax position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based solely on its technical merits  as of the reporting date 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion shall be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and expects that it will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated balance sheet  resu lts of operations and cash flows 
the company has estimated that a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately thousand to million will be recorded as a reduction to opening retained earnings to increase reserves related to uncertain tax positions  which is subject to revision as management completes its analysis 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which provides expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
in addition  sfas prohibits recognition of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements 
business environment the securities industry is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities and changes in interest rates  inflation  political events  investor participation levels  legal and regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements and competition  all of which have an impact on commissions  firm trading  fees from accounts under investment management  and investment income as well as on liquidity 
substantial fluctuations can occur in revenues and net income due to these and other factors 
the us economy continued to perform well during the year as financial conditions supported continued economic growth 
consumer spending and a strong labor market supported a growth in gnp 
however the economy s rate of growth moderated as it approached the end of the year reflecting continued softness in the housing market and higher short term interest rates 
financial markets responded positively to significant declines in oil and other commodity prices and modest improvements in the us trade deficit 
despite weakness in the dollar against other currencies  the anticipation of continued strong earnings by corporations and an expectation of stable interest rates provided the impetus for strong equity gains in the final months of the new york stock exchange nyse archipelago merger collectively referred to as nyse group  which took place in march  had a significant impact on the company s financial results for the year ended december  oppenheimer had been a member of the nyse since and was the beneficial owner of three memberships seats carried at a cost of million 
pursuant to the plan of merger between nyse and archipelago  oppenheimer surrendered its memberships in exchange for approximately thousand in cash and  nyse group common shares  par value per share  in the aggregate 
in lieu of the rights conferred by membership  oppenheimer purchased the rights to an annual renewable trading license 
this license allows oppenheimer continued physical and electronic access to the nyse trading facilities 
the nyse group common shares are subject to a three year restricti on on transfer  which were scheduled to expire in equal one third installments in march   and on may   the company sold  shares of nyse group consisting of  and  nyse group common shares that were originally restricted until march and march  respectively at a price of per share before commission as part of a secondary offering by nyse group shareholders 
the company s pre tax profit for the year ended december  reflect a net gain of approximately million included in other revenue on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   related to the exchange of seats for cash and nyse group common shares 
at december   the estimated fair value of the remaining nyse group common shares was approximately million  net of valuation adjustment  which is included in securities owned on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s pre tax profit for the year ended december  includes a net gain of million on the extinguishment of its variable rate exchangeable debentures the debentures 
the company retired million of the debentures on july  and the remaining million on october  for the most part  this gain represents the difference between interest expensed by the company since the issuance of the debentures on january  at a interest rate the annual effective interest rate over the life of the debentures compared to the actual interest costs of in and thereafter until october  excluding the gains from both the nyse group common shares and the debt extinguishment  described above  the company s revenue for the year ended december  increased by compared to revenue for the same period of the revenue increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period of came from higher transactional revenue from both private client and capital markets and increased fees from fee based programs 
interest income for the full year was impacted by higher rates on customer debit balances and increased activity in the securities lending business 
the company s performance for the year ended december  was positively impacted by its participation as general partner in various alternative investments that had significantly better performance in compared to the company s expenses increased by approximately for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to increased compensation and related costs as well as higher interest expense 
compensation expense tracks the trend in transactional revenue and includes the impact of the expensing of stock options since january  interest expense tracks the increase in interest revenue and is the result of higher interest rates  increased stock loan activity in and higher debt carrying costs compared to as previously mentioned  on july   to retire the debentures  the company issued a senior secured credit note in the amount of million at a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offering rate libor with a seven year term to a syndicate led by morgan stanley senior funding inc  as agent

the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk of its variable rate senior secured credit note 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the swap hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in month libor 
for the five months ended december   the effective interest rate on the senior secured credit note was compared to on the retired debentures 
net profit and earnings per share for the years ended december  and include increased income tax provisions  which raised the effective tax rate to and  respectively  because of reserves established for matters identified during tax examinations dating back to interest rate changes impact the company s costs associated with carrying proprietary fixed income and equity inventories as well as its cost of borrowed funds 
interest rates were higher in the year ended december  compared to investor interest in fixed income securities is driven by attractiveness of published rates  the direction of rates and economic expectations 
volatility in bond prices also impacts opportunities for profits in fixed income proprietary trading 
management monitors its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to mitigate risk of loss in volatile environments 
the company s focus continues to be the expansion and building of its business  through the attraction of new clients  investment in experienced professionals throughout the company and continued improvement in its technology platform 
regulatory environment the brokerage business is subject to regulation by the sec  the nyse  the nasd and various state securities regulators 
events in recent years surrounding corporate accounting and other activities leading to investor losses resulted in the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and have caused increased regulation of public companies 
new regulations and new interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations are creating increased costs of compliance and increased investment in systems and procedures to comply with these more complex and onerous requirements 
increasingly  the various states are imposing their own regulations that make the uniformity of regulation a thing of the past  and make compliance more difficult and more expensive to monitor 
this regulatory environment has resulted in increased costs of compliance with rules and regulations  in particular  the impact of the rules and requirements that were created by the passage of the patriot act  and the anti money laundering regulations aml that are related thereto 
the expectation is that the increased costs of compliance in today s regulatory environment are not temporary 
new rules relating to supervisory control processes nasd rule and nyse rule became effective during on march   the chief executive officers ceos of regulated broker dealers including the ceo of oppenheimer were required to certify that their companies have processes to establish and test policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with federal securities laws and regulations  including applicable regulations of self regulatory organizations 
the ceo of the company will be required to make such a certification on an annual basis 
mutual fund inquiry since the third quarter of  oppenheimer has been responding to the sec  the ny state attorney general the nyag  the nyse  the nasd and other regulators as part of an industry wide review of market timing  late trading and other activities involving mutual funds 
the company has answered several document requests and subpoenas and there have been on the record interviews of company personnel 
on june   oppenheimer received an invitation from the nyse to make a wells submission a formal response to a request from a regulator that describes why an action should not be brought with respect to its activities as a broker dealer and as a clearing firm in connection with allegedly improper market timing not late trading of mutual funds by several former employees 
oppenheimer has filed a response with the nyse 
a few of its former financial advisors  working from a single branch office  engaged in activities that are the subject of the sec s inquiry largely during the period before the company acquired the us private client division of cibc world markets on january  on january   the sec instituted administrative proceedings against three former employees and a current employee who had a supervisory role with respect to those employees 
the former financial advisors were charged with  among other things  violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws 
the current employee  a senior employee of oppenheimer  was charged with aiding these violations and of failure to supervise the former financial advisors 
the company was not charged in these proceedings and continues to cooperate in the investigation of market timing activity by the nyse discussed above 
the company has set aside reserves that it believes should address its financial exposure with respect to these matters 
the company continues to closely monitor its mutual fund activities and the activities of its employees 
other regulatory matters the company has been the subject of various regulatory investigations with respect to its operations up to and including most of these matters revolve around the period when the company was transferring the business and client accounts of various acquisitions it has made to a common systems platform between september and june during that period of time  the company absorbed approximately branch offices and  financial advisors  and transitioned more than  client accounts from four separate and distinct companies  each of which utilized a different technology platform 
the company s business doubled during this period 
as previously reported  certain of the company s operations were impacted beginning in june and the company experienced client service issues  which were subsequently corrected 
the new businesses undertaken by the company and the effect on the company s operations for the period described above has resulted in investigations by the sec  the nyse  and the nasd 
with the exception of the mutual funds timing matter described above  the company has settled substantially all outstanding matters with the nyse 
with the exception of the matters described below  the company has settled substantially all outstanding matters with the nasd 
on january   the nasd filed an action against oppenheimer and its chairman and ceo the complaint for alleged violations with respect to the company s filing of the nasd mutual fund breakpoint survey in this action could result in  among other things  monetary penalty  censure  suspension and or other remedial sanctions 
as previously disclosed  oppenheimer had previously informed the nasd of certain limitations within its system relative to selecting out and generating data in the form requested by the nasd  and the nasd had stated that no extensions to file would be granted to any firm 
as a result  just prior to the deadline  oppenheimer submitted the data it then had available 
the nasd informed oppenheimer within two days that its submission was deficient 
the company and mr 
lowenthal  the chairman and ceo  maintain that the assignment of overall responsibility f or the response to the survey was properly delegated by the ceo to individuals who had the requisite experience and background to complete and file the survey with the nasd 
the company and mr 
lowenthal believe that they have strong defenses for the action brought against them because of these issues and intend to vigorously defend the action 
as the nasd itself notes  the issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding by the nasd in which the allegations have not been heard or determined and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint 
prior to the filing of the complaint  the company advised the nasd that it had reviewed the actual breakpoints applied for the period through  a period longer than required by the nasd of similar member firms 
the company has returned to customers approximately  in breakpoint credits and revised and enhanced its procedures for determining applicable breakpoints 
all amounts due to customers have been refunded 
the company believes that the breakpoint survey matter was an industry wide problem and that the company has appropriately addressed in all respects the breakpoint issue with its clients 
the company and mr 
lowenthal are cooperating  have been cooperating and intend to continue to cooperate with all regulators and hope to reach a fair resolution of all outstanding regulatory issues 
the company has and continues to request an expedited adjudication of the matters in dispute 
in connection with a claim made by a client of the company  on august   the massachusetts securities division the msd filed an administrative complaint against the company s main operating subsidiary  oppenheimer co 
inc  as well as a financial advisor formerly employed by oppenheimer alleging that oppenheimer violated the massachusetts uniform securities act by failing to provide reasonable supervision of the former financial advisor thereby allowing the former financial advisor to engage in unlawful activity in the state of massachusetts 
the company has filed an answer to the complaint and believes its supervision was reasonable and in accordance with industry standards 
the company recently settled the client claim noted above 
in connection with the above matter  the msd requested that oppenheimer review and produce emails with respect to the former financial advisor and oppenheimer s supervision thereof 
as a result of this request  the msd commenced an investigation into the responses made to it in connection with the retention and retrieval of emails 
that investigation involves written responses by oppenheimer provided to the msd stating in substance that  at all times relevant to the underlying investigation  oppenheimer had in place adequate systems to retain and preserve emails 
oppenheimer subsequently informed the msd that  during the relevant period  one of its legacy email systems did not retain email in the required format and therefore some email may not have been retained 
the msd has stated in a letter to oppenheimer that the investigation involves the false and or misleading nature of the i nitial responses 
the msd has also informed oppenheimer that it believes oppenheimer has not been cooperating with the msd s investigation  a position with which oppenheimer disagrees 
the investigation  which is ongoing  also involves the supervision of the initial responses by senior management 
it is possible that in addition to seeking monetary penalties  the msd may seek to bring charges against individuals 
while the company continues to hope to reach a fair resolution of issues arising from this investigation and the pending administrative proceeding  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
on october   the company reached settlement with the nasd over matters initially alleged on may  relating to inaccuracies in its reporting to the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb in may and june  its failure to maintain electronic communications in a manner prescribed under sec rules from july through the first quarter of  as well as its policies and procedures related to these matters 
the settlement required payment of a fine in the amount of  which had been fully reserved in prior periods and the review  modification and enhancement of certain supervisory procedures 
as part of its ongoing business  the company records reserves for legal expenses  judgments  fines and or awards attributable to litigation and regulatory matters 
in connection therewith  the company has maintained its legal reserves at levels it believes will resolve outstanding matters  but may increase or decrease such reserves as matters warrant 
business continuity the company is committed to an on going investment in its technology and communications infrastructure including extensive business continuity planning and investment

see item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds and short term fixed income securities 
market risk 
market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
oppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports 
each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts 
positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis 
in its market making activities  oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets 
as a result of this  oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place  which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute to minute basis 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the company fails to perform its contractual obligations 
the company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
the company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
when oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction  it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances 
if the market price of the securities purchased or loaned has declined or increased  respectively  oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced 
a similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped 
in addition  oppenheimer s securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity 
in addition to monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers  oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the nyse 
generally  oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than of the value of the securities or if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues 
particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the nasdaq market 
in comparison  the nyse permits loans of up to of the value of the equity securities in a customer s account 
further discussion of credit risk appears in item  under the caption notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in its operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and it is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance policies and procedures including the maintenance of disaster recovery facilities and procedures related thereto that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
the company has procedures designed to assess and monitor counterparty risk 
for a discussion of funding risk  see item  under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
legal and regulatory risk 
legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  client claims and the possibility of sizeable adverse legal judgments 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly intense over the past few years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
timely and accurate compliance with regulatory requests has become increasingly problematic  and regulators have tended to bring enforcement proceedings in relation to such matters 
see further discussion in item  under the caption regulatory environment 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
the company has designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations under the usa patriot act 
see further discussion on the company s reserve policy in item  under the caption critical accounting policies  item  legal proceedings and item  regulation 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company does not rely on off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose or limited purpose entities to manage risk 
value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the sec s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading of financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal as at december  high low average equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december  the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately million million in in corporate equities  which are co related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
the company used derivative financial instruments to hedge market risk in fiscal and  including in connection with the senior secured credit note  which is described in note of the notes to the cons olidated financial statements 
such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item  risk management 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
