the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill  capitalization of direct response advertising costs  and self insurance liabilities 

table of contents allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables  changes in customer payment patterns  and historical experience 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on net income

changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin  and net income 
the company actively manages its inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and has consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill 
the company performs an impairment test of its goodwill based on its reporting units as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis 
in performing the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the units earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows  and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review required by sfas requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as different discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results

at december   deferred direct response advertising costs of million  net of accumulated amortization of million  were included in other assets  net  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the ability to capitalize direct response advertising costs depends on the continued success of campaigns to generate future net revenues 
the company estimates the future net revenues expected to result from sales to customers obtained through its advertising based on its past experience with similar campaigns 
an adverse change in the ability of the company s direct response advertising efforts to generate adequate future net revenues could result in an impairment of previously capitalized costs and cause future costs to be expensed as incurred
