table of contents versus consolidated net sales increased by million in the acquisition of cooper chengshan in february added million in net sales in the remainder of the increase was primarily a result of improved net pricing and product mix 
this increase was offset by lower unit volume 
operating profit in was million less than the operating profit reported in the favorable impacts of the cooper chengshan acquisition and improved pricing and mix were offset by increased raw material costs  lower sales volumes  higher products liability costs and restructuring costs related to five initiatives undertaken by the company 
these initiatives are described in more detail in the restructuring section below 
the company continued to experience significant increases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials during compared with the levels experienced during the principal raw materials for the company include synthetic rubber  carbon black  natural rubber  chemicals and reinforcement components 
a significant portion of the company s raw materials are crude oil based  a commodity which set new price ceilings during the increases in the cost of natural rubber and petroleum based materials were the most significant drivers of higher raw material costs during  which were up approximately million from the pricing volatility in these commodities contributed to the difficulty in managing the costs of related raw materials 
the increased price of crude oil and the growing global demand for its derivative products is contributing to the cost increases being experienced for raw materials used by the company 
approximately percent of the company s raw materials are crude oil based  a commodity which repeatedly set new price records during the company manages the procurement of its raw materials to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable pricing 
for natural rubber and natural gas  procurement is managed by buying forward of production requirements and utilizing the spot market when advantageous 
for other principal materials  procurement arrangements include supply agreements that may contain formula based pricing based on commodity indices  multi year agreements  or spot purchase contracts 
these arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in the addition of the chinese operations  higher advertising costs in the north american tire operations segment and the expense associated with the severance component of payments made to the former chairman  president and chief executive officer of the company accounted for this increase 
the company is a defendant in various judicial proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
a significant portion of these proceedings are products liability cases in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits and the establishment of a captive insurance company

the company continued the program effective april  with an increase in the per claim retention limit of million and a premium cost reduction of million 
the total per claim retention limit for claims occurring in the policy years subsequent to april  is million 
the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company offset by recoveries of legal fees 
legal costs are expensed as incurred and products liability insurance premiums are amortized over coverage periods 
the company is entitled to reimbursement  under certain insurance contracts in place for periods ending prior to april   of legal fees expensed in prior periods based on events occurring in those periods 
the company records the reimbursements under such policies in the period if the conditions for reimbursement are met 
products liability costs totaled million and million in and  respectively

interest expense decreased million in from primarily due to the company s repurchases of debt in and interest income decreased million in from as a result of lower cash levels in than in during  the company recorded dividend income from its investment in kumho tire co  inc a dividend of approximately per share was declared to shareholders of record on march  the company owns the equivalent of  shares and recorded million of dividend income 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual test for impairment and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill and in the indefinite lived intangible assets of its north american tire operations segment 
while the company made good faith projections of future cash flow in  it failed to meet those projections in due to industry conditions and other factors 
the company believes certain of these factors will continue to have an impact in and late in  the company implemented specific cost reduction initiatives to improve profitability 
following a review of the valuation of the segment s identifiable assets  the company wrote off the goodwill of the north american tire operations segment which totaled million and also recorded an impairment charge of million related to the indefinite lived intangible assets of the segment 
other net increased million in from primarily as a result of foreign currency gains being recorded in compared to losses in for the twelve months ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on a loss before taxes from continuing operations of million which includes minority interest of million and the impairment of non deductible goodwill 
since a valuation allowance was recorded in income tax expense for the net deferred tax asset position of the u 
s 
operations during the year  the remaining income tax benefit relates primarily to the utilization of certain tax attributes  the release of certain tax contingencies plus income tax expense from non u 
s 
operations 
comparable amounts for were an income tax expense of 
million on a loss before taxes of million 
a valuation allowance is required to be recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  when  based upon an assessment which is largely dependent upon objectively verifiable evidence including recent operating loss history  expected reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax loss carry back capacity  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each taxing jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise generates taxable income or losses 
in the united states  the company has recorded significant deferred tax assets  the largest of which relate to tax attribute carryforwards  products liability  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
these deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities  the most significant of which relate to accelerated depreciation 
based upon this assessment  the company has recorded a million valuation allowance for the portion of us deferred tax assets exceeding deferred tax liabilities with million being recorded as an expense in the pension liability and associated deferred tax asset adjustment recorded to equity in the fourth quarter as a result of adoption of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  accounts for million of the total valuation allowance 
the company intends to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the effects of inflation in areas other than raw materials and natural gas did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in versus consolidated net sales increased by million in the increase was primarily a result of improved net pricing and product mix 
this increase was offset by lower unit volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation 
operating profit in was million less than the operating profit reported in the favorable impacts of improved pricing and mix  lower products liability costs and reductions to cost of sales resulting from settlements with raw material suppliers for reimbursements of previously expensed costs were offset by increased raw material costs  lower sales volumes  increasing production complexity and the impact of the work stoppage at the texarkana  arkansas tire manufacturing facility 
the north american tire operations segment reached a contract agreement with members of united steelworkers of america local no 
on april  following a work stoppage at its texarkana  arkansas facility which commenced on march  the facility employs approximately  production people and produces approximately  tires per day at capacity 
the company experienced significant increases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials and natural gas  the principal energy source used in its manufacturing processes  during compared with the levels experienced during the principal raw materials for the company include synthetic rubber  carbon black  natural rubber  chemicals and reinforcement components 
the increases in the cost of crude oil based materials were the most significant driver of higher raw material costs  with synthetic rubber increasing approximately percent from the pricing volatility in commodities such as crude oil and  to a lesser extent  steel continued to contribute to the difficulty in managing the costs of related raw materials 
approximately percent of the company s raw materials are crude oil based  a commodity which repeatedly set new price records during the average cost of natural gas during increased approximately percent from the average cost during 
table of contents reliable supply of raw materials was a significant concern during  and contributed to the volatility of the company s costs for certain commodities 
the increased price of crude oil  the growing global demand for its derivative products  and the recent supply disruption in the united states for certain commodities are contributing to the cost increases being experienced for raw materials used by the company and adding to concerns regarding their availability 
the disruption of supply in the united states for carbon black and synthetic rubber caused by hurricane rita resulted in the company s decision to reduce production levels for certain of its products in its domestic facilities during the fourth quarter 
the production reductions were necessary to ensure the adequate and uninterrupted availability of these commodities to maintain production efficiencies and to assure the supply of certain products that are in high demand by the company s customers 
the company manages the procurement of its raw materials and natural gas to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable pricing 
for natural rubber and natural gas  procurement is managed by buying forward of production requirements and utilizing the spot market when advantageous 
for steel based tire reinforcement materials  procurement is managed through long term supply contracts 
for other principal materials  procurement arrangements include multi year supply agreements that may contain formula based pricing based on commodity indices 
these arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands 
the company reacted promptly to the supply disruptions occurring late in the third quarter by working to secure synthetic rubber and carbon black from alternative vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in the decrease resulted primarily from lower advertising costs and fringe benefits associated with employee programs that provide for compensation based on the profitability of total company financial results 
the north american tire operations segment conducts annual reviews of the enhanced product warranty reserve established in connection with the settlement of class action litigation 
this review resulted in a decrease to the reserve of 
million in compared to a decrease of million recorded in the company is a defendant in various judicial proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
a significant portion of these proceedings are products liability cases in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company

the company has also seen a downward trend in the natural rubber market since prices peaked in june natural rubber prices have decreased percent through november  however  due to the lead times involved in the procurement and shipment of natural rubber  the company will not see meaningful relief until early natural rubber prices have rallied since november and the upward movement is gaining strength 
while the company believes raw material  energy and transportation costs will remain near current levels throughout  these levels are substantially higher than those experienced during the first six months of the company expects the pace of the increases to slow down and eventually stabilize or slightly decrease

new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
the company accrues costs for products liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated 
the company believes the probability of loss can be established and the amount of loss can be estimated only after certain minimum information is available  including verification that company produced products were involved in the incident giving rise to the claim  the condition of 
table of contents the product purported to be involved in the claim  the nature of the incident giving rise to the claim and the extent of the purported injury or damages 
in cases where such information is known  each products liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances 
a judgment is then made  taking into account the views of counsel and other relevant factors  to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability 
the liability often cannot be determined with precision until the claim is resolved 
pursuant to applicable accounting rules  the company accrues the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another 
no specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or for asserted claims where the minimum information needed to evaluate the probability of a liability is not yet known 
however  an accrual for such claims based  in part  on management s expectations for future litigation activity is maintained 
because of the speculative nature of litigation in the united states  the company does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of potential loss for asserted and unasserted claims can be determined 
the total cost of resolution of such claims  or increase in reserves resulting from greater knowledge of specific facts and circumstances related to such claims  could have a greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company in future periods and  in some periods  could be material 
the company s exposure for each claim occurring prior to april  is limited by the coverage provided by its excess liability insurance program 
the program for that period includes a relatively low per claim retention and a policy year aggregate retention limit on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular policy year 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the april  to march  policy year were  higher than under the program in place prior to april   the per claim retention limit increased  and the aggregate retention limit was eliminated  while excess liability coverage increased by  the company continued the program effective april  with an increase in the per claim retention limit of  and a premium cost reduction of  the total per claim retention limit for claims occurring in this policy year is  the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company offset by recoveries of legal fees 
legal costs are expensed as incurred and products liability insurance premiums are amortized over coverage periods 
the company is entitled to reimbursement  under certain insurance contracts in place for periods ending prior to april   of legal fees expensed in prior periods based on events occurring in those periods 
the company records the reimbursements under such policies in the period the conditions for reimbursement are met 
products liability costs totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and include recoveries of legal fees of   and  in  and  respectively 
policies applicable to claims occurring on april   and thereafter  do not provide for recovery of legal fees 
income taxes the company is required to make certain estimates and judgments to determine income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are made in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions such as the us tax incentive for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to tax provisions in subsequent periods 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for income tax expense must be increased by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are deemed to be not recoverable 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net us deferred tax asset position at december  as it cannot assure the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of these deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that accounting period would be reduced by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves a degree of uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u 
s 
and other jurisdictions based on its estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are more likely than not 
if  and at the time  the company determines payment of such amounts are less likely than not  the liability will be reversed and a tax benefit recognized to reduce the provision for income taxes 
the company will record an increase to its provision for income tax expense in the period it determines it is more likely than not that recorded liabilities are less than the ultimate tax assessment 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
during  the company recorded impairment 
table of contents charges related to two restructuring initiatives in the north american tire segment 
the segment closed its manufacturing facility in athens  georgia and recorded million to write assets down to fair value 
the segment also recorded 
million associated with the write off of tire molds which were taken out of production in conjunction with the initiative to reduce the number of stock keeping units manufactured in its facilities 
during  impairments of 
million were recorded related to molds used in the north american tire operations segment 
during  impairments of million were recorded as part of the company s restructuring expenses related to the decision to cease radial medium truck tire production 
during  the company recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets of million associated with the chengshan acquisition 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
as discussed in the footnotes to the financial statements  note goodwill and intangible assets  the company assessed the goodwill and the indefinite lived intangible asset in the north american tire operations segment at december  and determined that impairment existed 
following a review of the valuation of the segment s identifiable assets  the company wrote off the goodwill of the segment 
the company reduced the value of the indefinite lived intangible at december  to the value indicated by the annual review 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension liabilities in the united states and the united kingdom and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the united states that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the rate used to estimate the value of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities for which they could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company considers the most recent available interest rates on moody s aa corporate bonds  with maturities of at least twenty years  late in the fourth quarter and then factors into the rate its expectations for change by year end 
the company discounted the expected pension disbursements over the next fifty years using a yield curve based on market data as of december   which validated the present value determined using the single benchmark rate for all years 
based upon this analysis  the company did not change the discount rate used to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities from percent 
a similar analysis was completed in the united kingdom and the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united kingdom pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the effect of this reduction in the discount rate assumption was to increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million which will also result in an increase of less than 
million in pension expense during the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  because the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increases in measuring its united states pension liabilities at december  and december  in the united kingdom  the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increase at december  compared to a rate of percent at december  the reduction is result of a pay reduction for process workers 
the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense  whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense  whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall  whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 

table of contents the company s investment policy for united states plans assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
the company s investment policy for united kingdom plan assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in fixed income securities 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
this computed rate of return is reviewed by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
the actual return on united states pension plans assets approximated percent in and percent in the higher actual return on plan assets reflects higher equity returns than in the prior year 
the actual return on united kingdom pension plan assets approximated percent in and percent in the lower returns in were mainly the result of lower returns on united kingdom and overseas equities 
using recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company maintained its estimate for the expected long term return on its united states plan assets at nine percent  the same assumption used to derive and expense 
the expected long term return on united kingdom plan assets used to derive the pension expense was percent  compared to a rate of percent used to derive the pension expense 
the lower rate is the result of a reduction in real bond yields in which led to an expectation of lower investment returns in  in addition to a 
percent reduction in the underlying assumed level of inflation 
the company has accumulated net deferred losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts are being amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  over periods ranging from ten years to years 
amortization of these net deferred losses was million in and million in the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 
 in and  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation  instituted per participant  or per household  caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the company implemented increased cost sharing in in the retiree medical coverage provided to certain eligible current and future retirees 
since then cost sharing has expanded such that nearly all covered retirees pay a charge to be enrolled 
the medical care cost trend rate has a significant impact on the liabilities recorded by the company 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase retiree medical obligations by million and increase retiree medical benefits expense by 
million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted in december the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as an option for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this fsp provided accounting and disclosure guidance for employers who sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits 
regulations regarding implementation of provisions relevant to the company s accounting are complex and contain acknowledged open issues 
the act reduced the company s net periodic postretirement benefit cost by million in including service cost  interest cost and amortization of the actuarial gain 
the total impact on the company s actuarial liability in  under all u 
s 
plans  was a reduction of million being accounted for as an actuarial gain to be amortized 
cumulative gains and losses are amortized as a portion of the company s periodic expense over a period of fifteen years 
at december   this actuarial gain has been reduced to million as a result of amortization  the company s revised expectations of the subsidy to be received and the impact of the act on the health care benefits being provided to its participants 
the company applied to receive the federal drug subsidy in and received 
million relating to the first three quarters of the year 
the company intends to continue to analyze the options available with respect to the relationship of the company health care benefits with all parts of medicare to attain the most cost effective coordination 
on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
this statement required the company to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of its pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans in the december  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to cumulative other comprehensive loss a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the adjustment to cumulative other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs  all of which were previously netted against the plans funded status in the company s consolidated balance sheets pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and sfas no 
these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the company s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost on the same basis as the amount recognized in cumulative other comprehensive loss at adoption of sfas no 

table of contents the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   or for any prior periods presented  and it will not effect the company s operating results in future periods 
had the company not been required to adopt sfas no 
at december   it would have recognized an additional minimum liability pursuant to the provisions of sfas no off balance sheet arrangements certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant of those leases is for a u 
s 
manufacturing facility with a remaining term of years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover two facilities in the united kingdom and manufacturing equipment 
these leases have remaining terms of from nine months to seven years and remaining payments of approximately million 
the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates from its financial instruments 
the company actively monitors its exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the impact of these risks 
see the significant accounting policies derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
these analyses measure the potential loss in future earnings  cash flows or fair values of market sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
a ten percent decrease in interest rates would have adversely affected the fair value of the company s fixed rate  long term debt by approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a ten percent increase in the interest rates for the company s floating rate long term debt obligations would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows 
to manage the volatility of currency exchange exposures related to future sales and purchases  the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for the residual portion  the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options with maturities of less than months pursuant to the company s policies and hedging practices 
the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the fair value of cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company s unprotected exposures to earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant at december  and the company enters into fair value  foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
the impact from a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s foreign currency denominated obligations and related foreign exchange contracts would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows
