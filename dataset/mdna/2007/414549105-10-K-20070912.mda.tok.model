item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was marked by some significant challenges total revenue was essentially flat in fiscal  compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal decreased to  compared with for fiscal operating margin was for fiscal  a decline from for fiscal net income decreased approximately for fiscal  compared with fiscal total us revenue decreased for fiscal  compared with fiscal however  total european revenue increased for fiscal  compared with fiscal total internet based revenue increased for fiscal  compared with fiscal us internet based revenue decreased for fiscal  compared with fiscal however  european internet based revenue increased for fiscal  compared with fiscal despite these challenges  we continue to support our business strategy into fiscal we believe that investing in our sales force is the best method to grow our revenue  and we will continue those investments 
specifically  our us sales force was up approximately from fiscal  and we hired and trained a dedicated european sales force during the fiscal year 
our european operations continue to grow sales  revenue and profits 
in addition  we believe that our acquisition of mediatransfer in early april was an important step in expanding our global footprint within europe  in order to enhance our clients needs for worldwide service 
in august  we took two significant steps toward expanding our global research capabilities by acquiring decima research  a leading canadian research firm  and marketshare  a private asian research firm with co located headquarters in hong kong and singapore 
adding the strengths of these firms will improve our global service offering and provide increased access into two fast growing regions that represent about a billion market opportunity 
by adding these firms  we now have a presence in six of the top ten global research markets  and access to two thirds of the global research market  up from approximately one half just six months ago 
in line with our global expansion goals  we will continue to look for attractive partners in other sizable and high growth regions around the world 

table of contents business combinations effective on april   pursuant to a share sale and purchase agreement dated march  by and among the company  its wholly owned subsidiary  harris interactive international inc hii  and the stockholders of mediatransfer  hii purchased of the outstanding shares of mediatransfer 
we believe that this acquisition will allow us to expand our access into the european research market and enable us to better serve our multinational clients 
mediatransfer has extensive experience and deep expertise in the consumer packaged goods cpg industry  including the application of proprietary technology that creates virtual retail shopping simulations to test package design  shelf placement configurations  pricing etc 
in addition to its cpg practice  mediatransfer has expertise in telecom  financial services and pharmaceutical research 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and was included in our financial statements commencing on april  further financial information about business combinations is included in note  business combinations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
restructuring fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to a facilities consolidation and headcount reduction  both designed to ensure the alignment of our cost structure with the operational needs of the business 
we negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement for our reston  virginia office  which resulted in a reduction of the square footage of rented space at that office by  square feet  located on the first floor  in exchange for a payment of million to the landlord  and contingent upon the landlord entering into a lease for the aforementioned first floor space  which subsequently occurred in june as a result of the amendment  our lease obligation over the remaining term of the lease will be reduced by approximately million from the initial lease  which when offset against the payment to the landlord for the space reduction noted above  will result in anticipated net savings of approximately million over the remaining lease term 
we also reduced the staff of our us operations by full time equivalents and incurred million in severance charges  all of which will involve cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring charges for the fiscal plan during the fiscal year ended june  amounts in thousands lease severance commitments total net charge during fiscal cash payments during fiscal remaining reserve at june  all actions in the plan were completed by june  cash payments in connection with the plan will be completed by december fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to certain actions designed to align the cost structure of our uk operations with the operational needs of that business 
management developed a formal plan that included closing two facilities in macclesfield and stockport and consolidating those operations into our hazel grove location 
this consolidation was completed by june  at a cost of less than million  the 
table of contents majority of which represented future cash payments on the remaining lease commitment for the macclesfield facility 
additionally  we classified the stockport facility and the related property  plant and equipment as assets held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
on december   we completed the sale of the stockport facility and the related property  plant and equipment for total cash consideration of million  which resulted in a gain of million 
the gain is recorded under gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  in connection with the facilities consolidation discussed above  we also reduced the staff of the affected operations by full time equivalents and incurred million in severance charges  all of which will involve cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring charges for the fiscal plan during the fiscal years ended june  and amounts in thousands lease severance commitments total net charge during fiscal cash payments during fiscal remaining reserve at june  cash payments during fiscal remaining reserve at june  all actions in the plan were completed by june  cash payments in connection with the plan will be completed by august as a result of the actions described above  we realized cash savings of approximately million in fiscal further financial information about our restructuring plans is included in note  restructuring charges  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell our rent and recruit business 
based upon our review and assessment of rent and recruit s net assets  the book values of its remaining net assets approximated their estimated fair value 
we classified rent and recruit as a discontinued operation  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
at june   we were in the process of identifying potential buyers or other interested parties and discussing a possible transaction with them 
on august   the sale of rent and recruit was completed 
the results of operations  net of taxes  and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of rent and recruit are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations  assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale  respectively 
all prior periods presented were reclassified to conform to this presentation 
these reclassifications of the prior period consolidated financial statements did not impact total assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  net income or cash flows 
further financial information regarding discontinued operations is included in note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or 
table of contents complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes and tax contingencies  hipoints loyalty program  restructuring charges  stock based compensation  post employment obligations  and discontinued operations 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis 
in assessing contract performance  both input and output criteria are reviewed 
costs incurred are used as an objective input measure of performance 
the primary input of all work performed under these arrangements is labor 
as a result of the relationship between labor and cost  there is normally a direct relationship between the costs incurred and the proportion of the contract performed to date 
costs incurred as an initial proportion of expected total costs is used as an initial proportional performance measure 
this indicative proportional performance measure is always subsequently validated against more subjective criteria ie relevant output measures such as the percentage of interviews completed  percentage of reports delivered to a client and the achievement of any project milestones stipulated in the contract 
in the event of divergence between the objective and more subjective measures  the more subjective measures take precedence since these are output measures 
clients are obligated to pay based upon services performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as it becomes probable that such losses will occur 
invoices to clients in the ordinary course are generated based upon the achievement of specific events  as defined by each contract  including deliverables  timetables  and incurrence of certain costs 
such events may not be directly related to the performance of services 
revenues earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings are classified as unbilled receivables 
amounts billed in excess of revenues earned are classified as deferred revenue 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of clients to make required payments 
we continually assess the collectibility of outstanding client invoices 
in estimating the allowance  we consider factors such as historical collections  historical write offs  a client s current creditworthiness  age of the receivable balance both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay 
actual collections could differ from our estimates  requiring additional adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to sfas no 
accordingly  the preliminary purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are valued separately based on estimates of future cash flows and are amortized over their expected useful life 
amortizable intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test under sfas no 
if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure impairment  if any  based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
as we have one reportable segment  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing our fair market value as determined by our publicly traded stock to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
based upon its annual evaluations  we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount at june   and  resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as a loss 
prior to performing our annual impairment analysis for the year ended june   we recorded a million impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal for the full amount of the goodwill attributable to hi japan  the operations of which have been classified as discontinued operations see note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
income taxes and tax contingencies we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases for operating profit and tax liability carryforward 
our consolidated financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that result from temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at june  
table of contents sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of the available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists 
actual outcomes that differ from our estimate of potential exposure could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
hipoints loyalty program in july  we initiated hipoints  a loyalty program designed to reward respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which occurs after one year of account inactivity 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from the expected redemption rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges represent costs incurred to better align our cost structure with the needs of our business 
restructuring charges can include termination benefits for reductions in staff  as well as costs for the consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities  if any 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions 
if actual conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record additional restructuring charges or reverse previously recorded charges accordingly 
for further discussion regarding the impact of restructuring charges on the results of our operations  see restructuring above 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the share based payment on the date of grant 
we elected to use the modified prospective approach for adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at july  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption resulted in the recognition of million of compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employee directors for the fiscal year ended june   with an additional million of compensation expense for the fiscal year ended june  as of june   we had million of total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under our long term incentive plans 
that expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which employs the following assumptions expected volatility based on historical volatilities from daily share price observations for our stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the options granted 
expected life of the option based on the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years  calculated using the simplified method as allowed by staff accounting bulletin no 
risk free rate based on the implied yield available at the time the options were granted on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option when granted 
dividend yield based on our historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to our shareholders 
expected volatility and the expected life of the options granted  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes option pricing model  involve management s best estimates at that time 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are set forth in note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report on form k 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards is based on the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
we grant options to purchase our stock at fair value as of the date of grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or restricted shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior and the vesting period of the respective stock options or restricted shares 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
post employment obligations we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives which obligate us to make payments for varying periods of time and under terms and circumstances set forth in the agreements 
in part  the payments are in consideration for obligations of the executives not to compete with us after termination of their employment and  in part  the payments relate to other relationships between the parties 
we account for our obligations under these agreements in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and to the extent that we become obligated in the future to make payments to one or more of our executives under their employment agreements  such obligations could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
the impact on our results of operations of post employment obligations that arose during the fiscal years ended june   and is discussed below within results of operations 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are defined in sfas no 
as a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
sfas no 
further provides that the assets and liabilities of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations 
table of contents be presented separately in the entity s balance sheet

year ended june  versus year ended june  revenue from services 
total revenue decreased by million to million for fiscal  a decrease of over fiscal this decrease in total revenue was due to the factors described below 
us revenue decreased by million to million for fiscal  a decrease of over fiscal this decrease in us revenue was principally driven by revenue declines in the following research groups healthcare  as a result of internal restructuring at certain of this group s clients  as well as certain industry challenges  including continued consolidation and realignment within the healthcare industry  technology and telecom  as a result of sales force turnover within this group  which has necessitated the rebuilding of the group s sales team throughout the fiscal year  and loyalty  as a result of our decision at the end of fiscal not to bid on a significant  recurring client tracking study because of its low profit margins  offset in part by winning a new tracking study at an existing client and reformulating the group s service offerings to better meet customer requirements 

table of contents offsetting the decrease in us revenue as noted above were revenue increases in the following research groups marketing and communications research  as a result of winning new tracking studies with new and existing clients  public affairs and policy  as a result of realigning this group s sales resources with the objectives of its business  and emerging and general markets  as a result of consistent efforts on the part of this group s sales resources to grow its client base 
european revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal european revenue increased primarily due to a favorable impact of million as a result of foreign exchange rate differences and the depreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro  our acquisition of mediatransfer in april  which contributed million in revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter  and our concerted efforts toward stabilizing and growing our european operations

the growth in european internet based revenue for fiscal is the result of our focus on training our european sales force on promoting the benefits of internet based data collection to their clients  and our april acquisition of mediatransfer  which contributed million in internet based revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal gross profit was principally impacted by increased utilization rates for professional staff during fiscal when compared with fiscal sales and marketing

table of contents a million increase in stock based compensation expense for options and restricted stock granted during fiscal  million in costs associated with an unsuccessful acquisition during the third fiscal quarter  and million in administration fees for the repurchase program  compared with less than million in such fees during fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of fixed and intangible assets that became fully depreciated or amortized during fiscal restructuring charges 
see above under restructuring for further discussion regarding our fiscal and restructuring plans 
gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets during fiscal consists of a million gain realized on the december sale of our stockport facility  along with million in net proceeds from the june sale of two internally developed patents 
no similar gains were realized during fiscal interest and other income

income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate was principally due to valuation allowance reversals  as more fully described in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
year ended june  versus year ended june  revenue from services 
total revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in total revenue was due in part to our september acquisition of wirthlin along with additional factors more fully described below 
us revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in us revenue was principally driven by revenue growth in the following research groups healthcare  as a result of our focus on improving the productivity of selling efforts in these markets through deep account penetration  as well as from the continued maturation of existing client relationships  technology and telecom  as a result of a strategic increase in our focus in these markets throughout fiscal  automotive  as a result of expanding our revenue base with several key clients in this market through deep account penetration  and product solutions  as a result of greater collaboration between this group and our researchers that work with clients across the various industries that we serve 

table of contents also  we believe that us revenue has increased as a result of our continued focus on building long term relationships with our clients in order to obtain projects that are recurring in nature 
offsetting the growth in us revenue as noted above were declines in revenue in the following research groups government  as a result of reconstituting the internal organizational structure of the group and redefinition of its approach within this market during fiscal  hisb  as a result of continued pricing pressures  and consumer packaged goods  as a result of turnover within its project and dedicated sales resource staffs

gross profit 
gross profit was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal increases in gross profit were more than offset by the impact of an approximately two point increase in the direct purchases component of cost of services as a percentage of total revenue as a result of the mix of projects for fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit is directly affected by overall revenue as well as changes in the pricing and mix of work performed and the cost components on each project eg project personnel time  data processing and data collection from one period to another 
additionally  gross profit reflects our treatment of all project personnel time which is not allocated to specific revenue generating projects as either sales and marketing or general and administrative expense based upon the unbillable tasks on which the time is spent 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense was essentially flat at million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was principally due to our strategic focus on improving the productivity of our selling efforts  offset in part by a slight increase in the unbillable project personnel time in support of sales and marketing efforts from approximately million for fiscal to million for fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal

interest and other income 
interest and other income was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in interest and other income was principally impacted by the following an increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from million at june  to million at june   and improved rates of return compared with those of fiscal income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on continuing operations for fiscal  compared with a provision for income taxes of million on continuing operations for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal includes million in tax benefits realized as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against tax losses for which it became more likely than not that a portion of the underlying benefit will be realized in the future 
income tax expense was principally a non cash item for fiscal and fiscal significant factors affecting company performance our revenue mix and gross profitability we treat all of the revenue from a project as internet based whenever more than of the data collection for that project was completed online 
regardless of data collection mode  most full service market research projects contain three specific phases as outlined in the chart below 
generally  the costs of a project are spread evenly across those three phases 

table of contents data colection internet based data collection has certain fixed costs relating to data collection  panel incentives and database development and maintenance 
when the volume of internet based work reaches the point where fixed costs are absorbed  increases in internet based revenue tend to increase profitability  assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses are properly controlled 
projects designated as internet based may have traditional data collection components  particularly in multi country studies where internet databases are not fully developed 
that traditional data collection component tends to decrease the profitability of the project 
profitability is also decreased by direct costs of outsourcing programming and telephone data collection and incentive pass through costs 
for further information regarding internet based revenue  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and  please see the table in our ability to measure our performance below 
our ability to measure our performance we closely track certain key operating metrics  specifically bookings  ending sales backlog  average billable full time equivalents  days of sales outstanding  utilization and bookings to revenue ratio 
each of these key operating metrics enables us to measure the current and forecasted performance of our business relative to historical trends and promote a management culture that focuses on accountability 
we believe that this ultimately leads to increased productivity and more effective and efficient use of our human and capital resources

to help that process  we provide trailing twelve month key operating metrics 
trailing twelve month data for certain of our key operating metrics for continuing operations at june   and at the last eight fiscal quarter end dates  were as follows us dollar amounts in millions sep dec mar jun sep dec mar jun consolidated revenue continuing operations only internet revenue of total revenue us internet revenue of us revenue european internet revenue of european revenue total bookings average billable full time equivalents ftes utilization bookings to revenue ratio additional information regarding each of the key operating metrics noted above is as follows bookings are defined as the contract value of revenue generating projects that are anticipated to take place during the next four fiscal quarters for which a firm client commitment was received during the current period  less any adjustments to prior period bookings due to contract value adjustments or project cancellations during the current period 
bookings for the three months ended june  were million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
million of the increase was principally attributable to our 
table of contents acquisition of mediatransfer in april  while the remainder was principally the result of the tracking studies discussed below under ending sales backlog 
monitoring bookings enhances our ability to forecast long term revenue and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
however  we also are mindful that bookings often vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
information concerning our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
ending sales backlog is defined as prior period ending sales backlog plus current period bookings  less revenue recognized on outstanding projects as of the end of the period 
ending sales backlog helps us to manage our future staffing levels more accurately and is also an indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
generally  projects included in ending sales backlog at the end of a fiscal period convert to revenue from services during the following twelve months  based on our experience from prior years 
ending sales backlog of million for the three months ended june  represented a increase compared with the ending sales backlog for the same prior year period 
million of the increase was attributable to our acquisition of mediatransfer  while the remainder was principally the result of million in tracking studies which we won during the fourth fiscal quarter 
average billable full time equivalents fte s are defined as the hours of available billable capacity in a given period divided by total standard hours for a full time employee and represent an average for the periods reported 
measuring fte s enables us to determine proper staffing levels  minimize unbillable time and improve utilization and profitability 
billable fte s of for the three months ended june  were essentially flat with the billable fte s reported for the same prior year period 
days of sales outstanding dso is calculated as accounts receivable as of the end of the applicable period including unbilled receivables less deferred revenue divided by our daily revenue total revenue for the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period 
measuring dso allows us to minimize our investment in working capital  measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts and helps forecast cash flow 
generally  a lower dso measure equates to more efficient use of working capital 
dso of days for the three months ended june  was consistent with dso for the same prior year period 
utilization is defined as hours billed by project personnel in connection with specific revenue generating projects divided by total hours of available capacity 
hours billed do not include marketing  selling or proposal generation time 
tracking utilization enables efficient management of overall staffing levels and promotes greater accountability for the management of resources on individual projects 
utilization for the three months ended june  was compared with for the same prior year period 
this increase is the result of our concerted efforts to maximize the utilization of our professional staff

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to timing differences compared with the prior fiscal year in payment of outstanding accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  which were offset by an improvement in the timeliness of collecting amounts due on outstanding invoices  as noted by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in cash collected on amounts billed in excess of costs deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to the following an increase in income from continuing operations  net of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and restructuring charges net of cash payments  and an improvement in the timeliness of collecting amounts due on outstanding invoices  as noted by a million increase in cash collected on accounts receivable and a million increase in cash collected on amounts billed in excess of costs deferred revenue 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million used in investing activities for fiscal the change from fiscal was principally due to our liquidation of marketable securities to fund repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program  described in further detail below  offset by our ongoing investing activities  including our acquisition of mediatransfer in april for million net of cash acquired 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally attributable to the following million decrease in net cash paid in connection with acquisitions  as there were no acquisitions in fiscal  million increase in cash used for the purchase of marketable securities to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  million decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  million decrease in cash used for capital expenditures to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  principally impacted by million in leasehold improvements to our new york city office during fiscal  and million used for the acquisition of intangible assets during fiscal  down from million for fiscal 
table of contents net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to our use of million in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock under our repurchase program  offset by million in cash proceeds from short term borrowings used to fund our acquisition of mediatransfer and share repurchases under our repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash used in financing activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to the following a million decrease in cash provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  million in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock under the repurchase program  which commenced in may  and a million decrease in cash used to repay outstanding notes  as all such notes were paid in full during fiscal working capital at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  a decrease of from million at june   as a result of the reasons described above 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the cash requirements that we anticipate will be necessary to support our planned operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses  we likely will be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
based upon our current relationships with financial institutions and financial condition  we believe that adequate funds will be available to support our acquisition activities on reasonable terms  but if such funds are not available when needed or on favorable terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  the marketing and selling of our services and our acquisition activities 
for the fiscal year ending june   our capital expenditures are expected to range between and million 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and the cash and marketable securities we held at june  will be sufficient to provide adequate funding for any foreseeable capital requirements that may arise 
in order to continue to generate revenue  we must continually develop new business  both for growth and to replace non renewed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of our revenue  we have had to find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as client relationships and work for continuing clients change and will likely have to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of our business plan  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted 
share repurchase program under the repurchase program authorized by our board on may   as amended on january and may   we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million during the fiscal year ended 
table of contents june  since the repurchase program s inception  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million 
all repurchased shares were subsequently retired 
at june   the repurchase program had million in remaining capacity 
purchases may be made in the open market or in any private transaction  and in accordance with applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
the board  in its discretion  may continue to make purchases prior to the program s expiration on december   subject to the conditions described above 
the repurchase program and related activity are more fully described above in item issuer purchases of equity securities 
line and letters of credit on august   we entered into a credit agreement the agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na the bank for a line of credit which enabled us to borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time outstanding through may  the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility were repayable as set forth in a line of credit note the note executed concurrently with the agreement 
under the agreement  the bank agreed to issue letters of credit under the line of credit at our request in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of the credit facility 
availability under the line of credit is reduced by the face amount of outstanding letters of credit 
upon termination of the line of credit  we must cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit 
we entered into amendments to the agreement and note on april  that increased the credit facility from million to million and extended the maturity date of the note from may  to april  the credit agreement and note were further amended on july  to increase their capacity to million 
the note  as amended  bears interest at either the prime rate  libor plus basis points or the federal funds rate plus basis points  based upon instructions provided by us as to whether advances are prime rate  libor or federal funds rate advances 
accrued interest is payable monthly  or in the case of libor rate loans  at the end of libor rate periods but at least every three months  and all accrued interest and outstanding principal is payable in full on april  the credit facility contains affirmative covenants that require us to maintain insurance  maintain our existence  provide financial information to the bank  and provide the bank with notice of material claims against us and defaults under the credit facility 
it also contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to change the nature of our business  cease operations  merge  acquire or consolidate with any other entity unless we are the surviving entity in such a merger  acquisition or consolidation  change our name  or sell a material part of our assets outside of the ordinary course of business  which sale would have a material adverse effect on us 
we also agree not to grant security interests in our accounts  our payment intangibles and our general intangibles relating to the payment of money 
there were million in short term borrowings outstanding under our arrangement with the bank at june   and letters of credit outstanding of approximately million  which correspondingly reduce our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
at june   we had no long term borrowings and at june  we had no short term or long term borrowings 
off balance sheet risk disclosure at june  and  we did not have any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements constituting an off balance sheet arrangement as defined in item a of regulation s k 

table of contents contractual cash obligations our consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at june  are as follows amounts in s payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncements see recent accounting pronouncements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements at june   for the fiscal year then ended  as well as the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements for future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have two kinds of market risk exposures  interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
as we continue to increase our debt and expand globally  the risk of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
we will continue to assess the need to  and will as appropriate  utilize interest rate swaps and financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks 
interest rate exposure until fiscal  we have not had interest rate exposure because we have not had material outstanding debt 
at june   we had outstanding short term debt under our credit facility of million 
the debt matures april  and bears interest at our election at either the prime rate  libor plus basis points  or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
we have elected the libor based rate for all of our borrowings to date 
assuming the outstanding borrowings remain at the same level  each one percentage point increase or decrease in libor would cost or save us million per year  approximately of our net income in fiscal cash flows would correspondingly decrease or increase 
foreign currency exposure as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have international sales and operations in europe  and to a more limited extent  asia 
therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us transactions are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
consolidated income and expense items are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in our results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of our international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries was not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating the results of our foreign subsidiaries with our us results  due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our consolidated operations 
however  if the operating profits in europe increase and we continue to expand globally  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
thus  we evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk on an ongoing basis 
since our foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency  given the amount and short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june  holding all other variables constant  we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
