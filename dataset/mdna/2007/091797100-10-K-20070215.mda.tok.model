item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement products  and technology based fastening systems 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems with these business segments comprising approximately   and  respectively  of the corporation s sales in as more fully disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on march   the corporation acquired vector 
vector  a designer and marketer of consumer portable power products  is included in the power tools and accessories segment 
the corporation markets its products and services in over countries 
during  approximately   and of its sales were made to customers in the united states  in europe including the united kingdom and middle east  and in other geographic regions  respectively 
the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments are subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which they operate as well as the strength of the retail economies 
the fastening and assembly systems segment is also subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates as well as to automotive and industrial demand 
an overview of certain aspects of the corporation s performance during the year ended december   follows sales for were  million  which represented a decline from sales of  million 
excluding incremental sales of the acquired vector business  sales for declined by from the level 
that decline was driven by lower sales in the united states due  in part  to weak demand in the face of slowing residential construction and actions taken by certain major customers late in to reduce inventory levels 
the corporation expects that continued weakness in key sectors of the us economy in  including significantly lower housing starts  will result in a sales decrease in the first six months of  as compared to the corresponding period 
operating income as a percentage of sales for decreased by approximately basis points from the level to 
a principal factor in that decline was rising commodity costs  which increased cost of goods sold in by approximately million over the level and are expected to increase cost of goods sold by approximately million in over the level 
interest expense net of interest income rose by million in over the level  primarily as a result of higher prevailing us interest rates  including the impact on the corporation s foreign currency hedging activities  and higher borrowing levels 
net earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   as compared to million  or per diluted share  in net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december   included two unusual items i million of pre tax income million after tax associated with a favorable settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer  and ii million of incremental tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december   benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding  principally as a result of share repurchases 
during  the corporation repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
shares used in computing annual diluted earnings per share declined by  from million for to million for the acquisition of vector on march   not only broadened the corporation s product offerings in its power tools and accessories segment but also contributed in incremental sales growth to the year ended december  the preceding information is an overview of certain aspects of the corporation s performance during the year ended december   and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  the corporation generally attempts to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
also  the corporation has attempted to differentiate between sales of its existing businesses and sales of acquired businesses 
that differentiation includes sales of businesses where year to year comparability exists in the category of existing or legacy businesses 
for example  in  the sales of vector are included in sales of acquired businesses 
sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume existing a unit volume acquired b price currency change in total sales a represents change in unit volume for businesses where year to year comparability exists  however  includes unit volume in of the european flex power tools business sold in november b represents change in unit volume for businesses that were acquired and were not included in prior period results 
total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a decrease from sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the vector acquisition  unit volume declined by from the level 
that decline was driven by lower sales in the united states due  in part  to weak demand in the face of slowing residential construction and actions taken by certain major customers late in to reduce inventory levels 
vector  a consumer portable power business acquired on march   contributed to consolidated sales 
pricing actions had a negative impact on sales in  as compared to the effects of foreign currency did not have a material effect on sales in  as compared to total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the masterfix business for the first three months of and of the porter cable and delta tools group for the first nine months of  total unit volume increased by during the year ended december  that increase was primarily driven by growth in the corporation s industrial power tools and plumbing products businesses in the united states 
unit volume of acquired businesses contributed to the sales growth for over the levels 
pricing actions had a negative effect on sales for  as compared to the effects of a weaker us dollar as compared to other currencies  particularly the canadian dollar  brazilian real  and euro  caused the corporation s consolidated sales for to increase by over the levels 
earnings the corporation reported consolidated operating income of million on sales of  million in  as compared to operating income of million on sales of  million in and to operating income of million on sales of  million in consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was  as compared to for that decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of significant commodity inflation  coupled with the negative effects both of pricing actions and of lower sales and production volumes over which to leverage fixed costs  which offset the positive effects that resulted from restructuring and productivity initiatives as well as favorable product mix 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was  as compared to for the corporation estimates that the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition had an approximate basis point negative impact on consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  in addition to favorable product mix  the results of restructuring and other productivity initiatives  the leverage of fixed costs over a higher sales base  and foreign currency effects favorably impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales in the corporation s legacy businesses 
these positive factors were partially offset by increased raw material costs  the negative effects of pricing actions  higher pension expense  and transition costs associated with integration of lockset operations in the hardware and home improvement segment 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in both and and in consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses in decreased by million from the level 
that decrease resulted from declines in certain sales related expenses due  in part  to lower sales volume as well as from declines in certain employee related expenses  including performance based incentive compensation  which offset incremental expenses of the acquired vector business and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by million over the level 
the effects of acquired businesses and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately two thirds of that increase  with the remainder principally resulting from additional sales related expenses associated with the higher level of sales experienced during the reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during as compared to the level was principally due to the impact of the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition due to the lower expenses of that business and the leverage of expenses over a higher sales base in the corporation s legacy businesses 
consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of higher prevailing us interest rates  including the impact on the corporation s foreign currency hedging activities  and higher borrowing levels 
the higher net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of both higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates  including the effects of higher prevailing us interest rates on the corporation s foreign currency hedging activities 
other expense income was million in  as compared to million in and million in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation received a payment of million in relating to the settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer 
consolidated income tax expense of million  million  and million was recognized on the corporation s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
the corporation s effective tax rate was for  as compared to an effective tax rate of for and for while the effective tax rate in approximates that in  the effective tax rate reflects incremental tax expense of million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of and the tax effects million of the million of income recognized upon settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer during absent those items  the effective tax rate would also approximate the effective tax rates in and a further analysis of taxes on earnings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation reported net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   as compared to net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   and million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  the corporation reported a net loss of 
million from discontinued operations in  as compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of million in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  reflected a 
million loss and a million gain  respectively  on the sales of discontinued operations 
the 
million loss recognized in related to the sale of the discontinued dom business 
the million gain recognized during consisted of a million gain on the sale of two discontinued businesses nemef and corbin in early  partially offset by a million goodwill impairment charge associated with the discontinued dom business 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  million  and million  or   and per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition to the matters previously noted  diluted earnings per share for benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding 
shares used in computing diluted earnings per share for of million  declined by to million shares for  principally as a result of share repurchases 
shares used in computing diluted earnings per share for of million approximated the level 
business segments as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems 
power tools and accessories segment sales and profit for the power tools and accessories segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers  
 
 
segment profit 


sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during decreased from the level 
sales of the acquired vector business resulted in a increase in sales during that increase was offset by a four percentage point decline in sales of the legacy power tools and accessories businesses that was primarily attributable to lower sales in the united states  partially offset by higher sales outside of the united states 
sales in north america decreased at a mid single digit rate during as compared to the prior year s level 
sales of the corporation s industrial power tools and accessories business in the united states decreased at a mid single digit rate primarily as a result of lower sales of equipment due largely to lower sales of generators and compressors  construction tools  and woodworking tools 
the us industrial power tools and accessories business was adversely impacted by weak demand in the face of slowing residential construction and actions taken by certain major customers late in to reduce inventory levels 
sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business in the united states decreased at a low single digit rate primarily as a result of lower consumer power tool and pressure washer sales  which were partially offset by the sales of the acquired vector business 
excluding the sales of the acquired vector business  sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business declined at a low double digit rate from the level with sales down across most channels and product lines 
actions taken by major retailers to reduce inventory levels also negatively impacted the us consumer power tools and accessories business in in canada  sales decreased at a low single digit rate  as a double digit rate of decline in sales of consumer power tools and accessories was partially offset by a mid single digit rate of increase in sales of industrial power tools and accessories 
sales of the european power tools and accessories business during increased at a low single digit rate over the level experienced in a mid single digit rate of increase of organic sales was partially offset by the sales decline that resulted from the divestiture of the flex business in late while sales grew in across most markets  marked growth was experienced in the middle east and africa region as well as in eastern europe 
sales of the european industrial power tools and accessories business increased at a low single digit rate in that increase was the result of a double digit rate of increase in legacy sales of the industrial power tools and accessories business in europe which was partially offset by the effects of the flex divestiture 
sales of the corporation s consumer power tools and accessories business in europe increased at a low single digit rate during sales in other geographic areas increased at a double digit rate in over the level 
that increase resulted from a double digit rate of increase in latin america and a mid single digit rate of increase in asia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for  as compared to for the corresponding period 
the incremental effect of the vector acquisition on segment profit as a percentage of sales for was not material 
gross margin as a percentage of sales for declined in comparison to the corresponding period primarily due to negative pricing actions  lower sales and production volume over which to absorb fixed costs  and commodity inflation 
those negative factors were mitigated by the benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives as well as favorable mix 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for increased  as compared to the corresponding period  due principally to the de leveraging of fixed and semi fixed costs over a lower sales base 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during increased over the level 
the incremental effect of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group for the first nine months of accounted for percentage points of the increase in  while sales of the legacy power tools and accessories businesses  including the acquired porter cable and delta tools group for the final three months of  accounted for the remaining percentage points of growth 
sales in north america increased during over the prior year s level 
of this increase  percentage points were due to the incremental sales of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group for the first nine months of and the remaining percentage points were due to the legacy power tools and accessories business 
sales of the corporation s legacy industrial power tools and accessories business in north america increased at a double digit rate over the levels 
sales of the corporation s legacy consumer power tools and accessories business increased at a mid single digit rate as a result of higher sales of consumer power tools and accessories  lawn and garden products  and cleaning and lighting products 
sales in europe during increased at a mid single digit rate over the levels due to the incremental effect of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group 
excluding the incremental effect of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group  sales in europe increased slightly over the level 
sales of the corporation s legacy industrial power tools and accessories business in europe during increased at a low single digit rate as compared to as weaker economic conditions in the united kingdom mitigated growth in other regions 
sales of the corporation s legacy consumer power tools and accessories businesses in europe during approximated sales in the prior year 
in november  the corporation sold the flex business  the major european component of the porter cable and delta tools group 
sales in other geographic areas increased at a double digit rate during over the levels 
that increase resulted from a double digit rate of increase in latin america and asia  which was partially offset by a double digit rate of decline in australia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for  as compared to in that increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales resulted from a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to both the impact of the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition due to the lower expenses of this business and the leverage of expenses over a higher sales base in the corporation s legacy businesses 
gross margin as a percentage of sales declined during as compared to as the impact of the lower margin porter cable and delta tools group offset improvements in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the corporation s legacy businesses 
gross margin improved in the legacy businesses in due to favorable product mix  productivity gains  foreign currency effects  restructuring savings  and absorption benefits  which offset the negative effects of pricing actions and raw material inflation 
due to the ongoing integration of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group into its legacy businesses  it is difficult to precisely determine the individual profit contributions of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group and of the legacy businesses 
the corporation estimates that the porter cable and delta tools group acquisition had an approximate basis point negative impact on segment profit as a percentage of sales for hardware and home improvement segment sales and profit for the hardware and home improvement segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers  
 

segment profit 


sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment during decreased from the level  due primarily to a mid single digit rate of decline in sales of plumbing products 
despite a double digit rate of decline in us housing starts in  sales of security hardware products approximated the level 
sales of kwikset products grew at a low single digit rate  as higher retail sales and the effects of a price increase during the fourth quarter of offset weakness in the wholesale channel 
that growth in kwikset sales offset a low single digit rate of decline in sales of weiser and baldwin products 
segment profit as a percentage of sales in the hardware and home improvement segment decreased from in to in the decline in segment profit as a percentage of sales in was attributable to a decline in gross margin  as the favorable effects of restructuring integration and productivity initiatives  coupled with price increases instituted by the segment  were insufficient to offset the negative effects of significant commodity inflation  particularly with respect to copper and zinc  and lower sales and production volumes 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in  as compared to  as a result of cost reduction initiatives 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment increased during over the level 
during  sales of plumbing products increased at a double digit rate over the level due to increased listings at a significant customer and strong sales at other retailers 
sales of security hardware products in increased slightly over the level  as a mid single digit rate of increase in sales of the kwikset business in north america was substantially offset by a mid single digit rate of decline in sales of the baldwin and weiser businesses 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment was for and for the decline in segment profit as a percentage of sales in was attributable to a decline in gross margin  which was primarily due to the negative effects of pricing actions  higher raw material costs  and transition costs associated with the integration of lockset operations  including the closure of a manufacturing site 
gross margin for was also negatively impacted by the write down of property and equipment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly in  as compared to the level  due to the leverage of expenses over a higher sales base in the kwikset and price pfister businesses  which was partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs 
fastening and assembly systems segment sales and profit for the fastening and assembly systems segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers 


segment profit 


sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment increased in over the level 
sales of the north american businesses declined at a mid single digit rate  reflecting both weak industrial sales and weak automotive sales in the face of production cuts by automotive customers 
sales in the european industrial business rose at a low single digit rate while sales in the european automotive business approximated the prior year level 
in asia  sales grew at a double digit rate  reflecting strong sales in both japan and china 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment increased slightly from in to in the segment reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  despite higher research and development expenditures  due to spending controls in however  that favorability was offset by a decline in gross margin  primarily as a result of commodity inflation and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment increased by in over the level  with the incremental sales of the masterfix business for the first three months of accounting for percentage point of that increase 
sales in the automotive channel in north america increased at a mid single digit rate over the level experienced in sales in the industrial channel in north america decreased at a low single digit rate  as compared to sales in europe increased at a double digit rate  as compared to sales in the european industrial business increased at a high single digit rate of growth due in part  to incremental sales of the acquired masterfix business during over the level 
sales in the european automotive business increased at a double digit rate during over the level 
sales in asia during increased at a double digit rate  as compared to segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment increased from in to in the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales was attributable to the positive effects of pricing actions and the leverage of expenses over a higher sales base  partially offset by higher commodity costs 
other segment related matters as indicated in the first table of note of notes to consolidated financial statements  segment profit loss  associated with corporate  adjustments  and eliminations was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
corporate expenses for the year ended december   declined from the prior year s level as the positive effects of certain lower employee related expenses not allocated directly to the reportable business segments including performance based incentives  as well as higher corporate expense allocations charged directly to the corporation s business segments  were partially offset by the negative effects of higher pension and environmental expenses 
corporate expenses for the year ended december   declined from the prior year s level as the positive effects of increased allocations of corporate expenses to the reportable business segments to reflect the impact of acquired businesses  lower expenses associated with intercompany eliminations  and a lower level of expenses directly related to the reportable business segments offset the negative effects of increased pension  postretirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in determining segment profit  expenses relating to pension and other postretirement benefits are based solely upon estimated service costs 
expense recognized by the corporation in relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans increased by approximately million over the levels 
expense recognized by the corporation in relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans increased by approximately million over the levels 
the adjustment to businesses postretirement benefit expense booked in consolidation as identified in the second table included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was expense of million in  as compared to expense of million for and income of 
million for that increase in expense resulted from the higher level of pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in excluding higher service costs reflected in segment profit of the corporation s reportable business segments not allocated to the reportable business segments 
income expenses directly related to reportable business segments booked in consolidation  and  thus  excluded from segment profit for the reportable business segments  were 
million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the 
million of segment related expense excluded from segment profit in principally related to an increase in reserves for certain matters associated with the power tools and accessories segment 
however  that increase was substantially offset by the reversal of certain performance based expenses included in the allocation of corporate expenses to each of the reportable business segments 
the million of segment related income excluded from segment profit in principally related to a reduction in reserves for certain legal matters associated with the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
the million of segment related expense excluded from segment profit in principally related to restructuring related expenses associated with the hardware and home improvement and power tools and accessories segments 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the european security hardware business  consisting of the nemef  corbin  and dom businesses  has been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
as such  the operating results  assets and liabilities  and cash flows of the discontinued european security hardware business have been reported separately from the corporation s continuing operations 
in november  the corporation completed the sale of the dom security hardware business for an aggregate price of million  net of cash transferred 
in january  the corporation completed the sale of two european security hardware businesses  nemef and corbin  for an aggregate price of million  net of cash transferred 
net loss earnings of the discontinued european security hardware business were 
million for the year ended december   and million 
per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december  restructuring and integration actions the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce fixed costs  simplify or improve processes  and eliminate excess capacity 
a tabular summary of restructuring activity during the three years ended december   is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the corporation recognized million of pre tax restructuring and exit costs related to actions taken in its power tools and accessories segment 
the restructuring actions taken in principally reflected severance benefits 
the million charge recognized during was offset  however  by the reversal of million of severance accruals established as part of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
adjustments to the severance component of restructuring reserves previously established related to i actual attrition factors that differed from those initially estimated  ii more cost effective methods of severing employment that became probable  typically based on negotiations with trade unions or local government institutions  and iii amendments to the initial plan that were approved by the appropriate level of management  based primarily on changes in market conditions that dictated a modification to the intended course of action 
during  none of the adjustments to the severance obligations recorded in connection with restructuring actions was individually significant 
adjustments to the asset write down component of restructuring reserves previously established related to the receipt of proceeds in excess of adjusted carrying values of fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with the restructuring actions 
adjustments to the other charge component of restructuring reserves previously established principally related to settlement of operating lease commitments at amounts less than initially estimated or the corporation s ability to sublease certain facilities exited as part of the restructuring actions 
during  the corporation substantially completed the execution of the restructuring plan that was formulated in the fourth quarter of and the closure of the manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognized related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses included items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefited on going operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results included approximately million of restructuring related expenses for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million of restructuring related expenses for both and the corporation realized benefits of approximately million and million in and  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
those benefits resulted in a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to the previously discussed restructuring actions  the corporation also identified opportunities to integrate businesses it has acquired  including the porter cable and delta tools group as well as vector 
prior to the date of the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and during  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure  as well as to integrate  these businesses into its existing power tools and accessories segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring integration actions relating to the acquired business in the amount of million 
these actions principally reflected severance costs associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of three manufacturing facilities  and lease and other contractual obligations for which no future benefit would be realized 
certain of these restructuring integration actions commenced in and the remainder commenced in  all actions were substantially completed in prior to the date of the acquisition of vector and during  the corporation identified opportunities to integrate that business into its existing power tools and accessories segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring integration actions relating to the acquired business in the amount of million 
these actions principally reflected severance costs associated with administrative and distribution functions of the acquired business  as well as the cost of lease and other contractual obligations for which no future benefit would be realized 
these actions are expected to be completed by mid the corporation expects that incremental pre tax savings associated with the integration of the porter cable and delta tools group will benefit results by approximately million in  net of integration related expenses 
the corporation expects that principally all of those incremental pre tax savings will benefit gross margin 
ultimate savings realized from restructuring integration actions may be mitigated by such factors as economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
from time to time  currencies may strengthen or weaken in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency movements  there is no assurance that such movements will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million  as compared to a decrease of million in the materials used in the manufacturing of the corporation s products  which include certain components and raw materials  are subject to price volatility 
these component parts and raw materials are principally subject to market risk associated with changes in the price of steel  resins  copper  aluminum  and zinc 
the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market  and the majority is available through multiple sources 
rising commodity costs decreased operating income in by approximately million from the level and are expected to decrease operating income by approximately million in from the level 
while future movements in prices of raw materials and component parts are uncertain  the corporation uses a variety of methods  including established supply arrangements  purchase of component parts and raw materials for future delivery  and supplier price commitments  to address this risk 
in addition  the corporation utilizes derivatives to manage its risk to changes in the prices of certain commodities 
as of december   the amount outstanding under commodity hedges was not material 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   as compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years  as compared to years at december   and years at december  at december   average long term debt maturity was years  as compared to years at december   and years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates us dollars in millions thereafter total fair value assets liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate other currencies average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us dollars 

average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps us dollars average pay rate a average receive rate a the average pay rate for swaps in the notional principal amount of million is based upon month forward libor with swaps in the notional principal amount of million  million  and million maturing in   and thereafter  respectively 
the average pay rate for the remaining swaps is based upon month forward libor 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed previously  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar 
the corporation estimated that this would have the effects of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
the corporation also estimated the effects on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  as compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled  million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation develops the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
the corporation s discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans was and at december  and  respectively 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
the corporation s expected long term rate of return assumption for united states defined benefit plans for and is 
the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate fair value of plan assets exceeded the market related value of assets by approximately million as of the measurement date 
differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will approximate the costs recognized in in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no requires two major changes to accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans  with two different effective dates 
the first requirement of sfas no 
 which the corporation adopted as of december   requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recorded through comprehensive income in the year in which those changes occur 
the impact of the corporation s adoption of sfas no 
is more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the second requirement of sfas no 
 which is effective for the corporation as of december   requires that the funded status be measured as of an entity s year end balance sheet date rather than as of an earlier date as currently permitted 
the corporation currently uses a measurement date of september for the majority of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
the corporation is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the corporation s financial statements or tax returns 
additionally  the corporation is subject to periodic examinations by taxing authorities in many countries 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
a discussion of a significant tax matter that is the subject of current litigation between the corporation and the us internal revenue service is included under the caption financial condition
