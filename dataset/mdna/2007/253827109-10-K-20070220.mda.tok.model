this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of cardiovascular imaging services and solid state nuclear medicine imaging products to physician offices  hospitals and imaging centers 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are mobile as well as fixed and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time  when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras 
the cameras and accompanying equipment fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital 
highlights our consolidated revenues were million in  which represented an increase of over attributable to growth in our product business 
in dis  revenue decreased to million  and in the product business  revenue increased to million 
as discussed in previous filings  beginning in june  dis phased out providing stress agents used in some imaging procedures 
as a result  we recognized million of stress agent revenue in compared to million recognized in as of december   our dis segment operated in states and the district of columbia 
our dis business performed  service days during compared to  service days during  and we performed more than  studies in as compared to  studies in revenue per day was essentially unchanged at  for compared to  for excluding stress agent revenue we received through approximately mid  revenue per day for was  our dis gross margins in decreased to compared to in  due primarily to an additional million of personnel costs previously recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the additional personnel costs are now included in costs of revenues as the focus and responsibilities of these personnel has shifted towards increased operational as opposed to administrative tasks 
during  we increased the number of mobile cameras we operate from to as part of our plan to upgrade our dis camera fleet over the next few years  we placed triple headed cameras into our dis business in we also closed four unprofitable hubs  negotiated additional supply cost savings  automated various processes to improve our insight into hub and customer profitability  and signed our first ultrasound imaging services contract 
we obtained additional hub accreditation to respond to the reimbursement requirements of some third party payors 
as of december   we obtained accreditation from the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of nuclear medicine laboratories for of our dis hub locations 
during  our product business delivered gamma cameras compared to cameras during product gross margins improved to compared to during  due primarily to the delivery of more cameras and improved margins on our camera service and maintenance contracts 
in the summer of  we launched our new triple headed cardius xpo camera  designed to provide improved image quality  high patient throughput  a lower cost structure and increased reliability and serviceability 
the camera can image patients weighing up to pounds and includes our latest image acquisition and processing software 
we anticipate releasing the cardius and cardius cameras with the xpo features and benefits in the first part of stock based compensation costs increased million to million for compared to as the result of the adoption of a new accounting principle 
overall  we ended the twelve months of with a consolidated net loss of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the twelve months of 
table of contents our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of approximately  cardiologists  the larger practices among the  internists and family practitioners  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac procedures 
we estimate that there are approximately  internist practices with more than four internists 
as of december   we have provided imaging services through dis to approximately physicians and physician groups  the majority of which are cardiologists  and have sold cameras to customers through our product segment 
according to imv medical information  us procedure volume in nuclear medicine excluding pet studies grew by between and to an estimated million nuclear imaging procedures in  of which some million were cardiovascular specific procedures 
the national electrical manufacturers association  or nema  estimates that sales of general nuclear imaging equipment declined approximately during we believe our market has been negatively affected by declining reimbursement  significant pricing pressures in the product business  and continuing efforts by some third party payors to reduce health care expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications  or disallowing reimbursement if imaging is performed with mobile or leased cameras 
a number of smaller companies have recently begun to market mobile nuclear imaging cameras for cardiac applications  and we believe competition from local or regional companies providing mobile imaging services has increased 
we expect each of these trends to continue 
revenue sources we generated revenues within two primary operating segments our dis business and product sales business 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive and mobile imaging services leasing program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform nuclear imaging in the physician office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis leasing service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
we also offer digitech leases to customers who own one of our cameras but wish us to provide staffing and other support services 
dis leasing services are primarily provided to cardiologists and internists 
physicians enter into annual contracts for imaging services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to three times per week  adjusted for holidays and vacations 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to summer slowdowns principally relating to vacations  holidays and inclement weather 
historically  the dis results have been most affected by seasonality in the third quarter 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and other ancillary items  and from our camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
we do not anticipate that the international market will be a significant source of revenues in the foreseeable future 
despite the general decline in the nuclear cardiology market  our product business delivered cameras in compared to cameras in our new cardius xpo camera series allows physicians to choose among single  dual or triple head cameras to accommodate their practices speed and throughput needs  or to upgrade a single head camera to a dual or triple head configuration as their practice grows or changes 
trends and drivers our dis business in was able to attract a larger number of new customers  some of whom were larger  multi specialty practices 
integrated delivery networks  hospital outreach programs and multi location practices expressed increased interest in our dis leasing services 
further  we signed our first contract for the delivery of ultrasound imaging services 
we believe these trends will continue in 
table of contents the number of dis physicians who purchased their own cameras or switched to a different service provider increased during the second half of medicare reimbursement for will decline by approximately over for the imaging procedures most often performed by our physician customers 
in addition  a greater number of third party payors adopted guidelines that would prohibit reimbursement for certain imaging procedures performed with mobile or leased equipment or by unaccredited facilities 
we plan to continue our efforts to obtain accreditation for our dis hub locations in in the product business  industry sources predict that the rate of decline of sales of cardiac specific nuclear camera will slow from an estimated to approximately in  and that purchases of multi head cameras will far outpace those of single head cameras 
during  we believe we were able to expand our market share and we will continue to invest in research and development to improve the image quality  speed  reliability  cost structure and overall performance of our multi headed cameras and software to enable us to capture an increasing share of the gamma camera market 
however  we continue to experience pricing pressures on the majority of our cameras 
the hospital market has expressed a renewed interest in our general purpose single head camera  and we expect to continue to sell more cameras into this market in our camera maintenance margins have improved as the number of cameras under contract grew and our service logistics have become more efficient  and we believe these improvements will continue in results of operations the following table sets forth our results from operations  expressed as percentages of total revenues for the years ended december   and revenues dis product total revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization and impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense accretion of deferred issuance costs on preferred stock net income loss applicable to common stockholders comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated

table of contents dis 
our dis revenue decreased to million for  which represents a decline of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in dis revenue resulted primarily from phasing out the delivery of stress agents to the majority of our dis customers in june stress agent revenue was million for the last seven months of compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
we anticipate that our dis revenue will increase as we expand into new markets and continue to penetrate existing markets 
such growth will fluctuate  however  based on seasonality stemming from physician vacations  holidays  inclement weather and start up time required by sales representatives as we enter new geographical areas 
product 
our product revenue was million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the increase in product revenue is due to selling cameras in compared to in  resulting in million of additional revenues  and an increase in camera service and maintenance contract revenues of nearly million

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenues were million in  which was essentially unchanged from the prior year  as the increase in demand for our dis imaging services offset the decrease in revenue product revenue

net income loss our net loss was million in compared to net income of million in  as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures 
working capital is required principally to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of dis cameras and vans  computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  high grade auction rate securities and us government or corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering  together with cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations totaled million for we incurred a net loss of million  however  million of this amount represented non cash charges including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation

we estimate that the remaining cost of this plan will be approximately to million through  which we expect to fund from existing cash resources 
debt service as of december   we had capital lease obligations totaling million 
these obligations are secured by the specific equipment financed under each lease and will be repaid monthly over the lease terms  which range from to months 
our dis subsidiary entered into the majority of these capital lease obligations 
we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s opinion  very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that are most subject to important estimates or assumptions include those described below 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from providing in office services to support the performance of nuclear imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
when all of the following four criteria are met a contract or sales arrangement exists  products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our dis revenue is recorded once the services and disposables are provided and consumed  which is normally on the day of the service 
for our product revenue  these criteria are usually met upon delivery 

table of contents reductions to our dis revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments 
reductions to product revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments and credit memos and historically have not been significant 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments historically  the need to estimate reserves for accounts receivable has been limited to our dis business 
we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
dis payment adjustments and credit memos are adjustments for billing errors that are normally adjusted within the first days subsequent to the performance of service  with the majority occurring within the first days 
reserves are provided as a percentage of dis revenue based on our historical experience rate 
we use a combination of factors in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
each account is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis and a reserve percentage varying from zero to for each account is established 
we do not establish reserves for accounts with a history of payment without disputes 
we generally reserve a portion of the outstanding balance for accounts that are more than days late and or under dispute 
we reserve of the outstanding balance for accounts that we believe constitute a high risk of default based on factors such as level of dispute  payment history and our knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its obligations 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectibility could be impacted by material amounts by changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
the provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as our average dis customer balance is less than  and we generally do not have any single receivable in excess of  long lived assets we state property and equipment at cost 
we capitalize betterments  which extend the useful life of the equipment 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment on the straight line method over the estimated useful life three to seven years for property and equipment of the assets 
we follow financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  we measure the impairment recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we undertook an assessment of our dis camera fleet to determine whether and when to deploy newer and more technically advanced models 
based on our assessment  we established a program to replace our existing camera fleet in its entirety over the next three years and we also concluded that we should reduce the depreciable life of our dis cameras from seven to five years 
assets are examined for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that may indicate potential asset impairment 
inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances quarterly for excess or obsolete inventory levels 
except where firm orders are on hand  we consider production inventory quantities in excess of the next months demand as excess and reserve for them at of cost  depending on our knowledge and forecast for the product 
service inventory in excess of months demand is likewise reserved at of cost 
we establish obsolescence reserves at for obsolete products 
we review the reserve quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
once the inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 

table of contents warranty we provide a warranty on certain of our products and accrue the estimated cost at the time revenue is recorded 
since july  substantially all of the warranty periods have been months before customer sponsored maintenance begins 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems at customers covered by warranty 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas  shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption 
the fair value of adoptions is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method under sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  in accounting for our equity plans 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
those amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to cost of revenues and operations over the vesting period of the options 
under sfas r  we calculated the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes merton model for the year ended december  were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
the weighted average expected option term for reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which was issued in march the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
estimated volatility for fiscal also reflects the application of sab interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar public entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the return on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
