overview fsp corp 
or the company  operates in two business segments real estate operations and investment banking investment services 
the real estate operations segment involves real estate rental operations  leasing  interim acquisition financing  development services  asset property management services  property acquisitions and dispositions 
the investment banking investment services segment involves the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that include the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in private placements 
the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states 
these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level 
we have no influence on the national market conditions 
we look to acquire and or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur 
our investment banking investment services customers are primarily institutions and high net worth individuals 
to the extent that the broad capital markets affect these investors our business is also affected 
these investors have many investment choices 
we must continually search for real estate at a price and at a competitive risk reward rate of return that meets our customer s risk reward profile for providing a stream of income and as a long term hedge against inflation 
trends and uncertainties real estate operations our property operations during the fourth quarter of produced profit results that were generally in line with management s expectations 
we believed would be a mixed year for real estate rental operations especially in the office sector  which is our primary property type 
in fact  showed some modest improvement in occupancy  but little rental rate movement in most real estate markets that we are in around the country 
in most of our office markets  occupancy rates increased and sublease inventory continued to decrease 
the general economy did continue to improve in  and management believes that may continue the positive trend and show legitimate broad based improvement in real estate operating fundamentals  particularly in the office markets in which we are involved 
nevertheless  assuming a normal cyclical continuation of the current us economic expansion  it is likely to take at least one more year for office occupancies and rents to reach levels that were prevalent in   and the portfolio was approximately leased at december  excluding leases expiring on that date 
approximately of the square footage in our real estate portfolio has leases that are scheduled to expire in as compared to that was scheduled to expire in we cannot predict when existing vacancy will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be  although we expect to renew or sign new leases at current market rates for the locations in which the buildings are located  which in some cases will be below the expiring rental rates 
discontinued operations and property dispositions during the year ended december   the company disposed of one apartment property and five commercial properties 
the apartment property is located in katy  texas 
the five commercial properties are located in santa clara  california  fairfax and herndon  virginia and north andover and peabody  massachusetts 
an agreement was also reached to sell an office property in greenville  south carolina  which was sold on january  during the year ended december   the company disposed of three apartment properties and three commercial properties 
the three apartment properties included two that are located in houston  texas  and one in baton rouge  louisiana 
the three commercial properties are located in folsom  california  columbia  maryland and san diego  california 
accordingly  as of december  the south carolina property is held for sale and is classified as such on our financial statements 
the operating results for these real estate assets have been reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the years ended december   and we continue to evaluate our portfolio  and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
investment banking investment services unlike our real estate operations business  which provides a rental revenue stream which is ongoing and recurring in nature  our investment banking investment services business is transactional in nature 
the sponsored reit syndications completed this year and the related amount of equity raised in were above our expectations 
future business in this area  while always uncertain  is becoming more encouraging to us than in the past two years 
our property acquisition executives continue to be concerned about high valuation levels for prime commercial investment real estate 
it appears that a combination of factors  including low interest rates  a growing general economy and substantially increased capital allocation to real estate assets is increasing prices on many properties we would have an interest in acquiring 
this upward pressure on prices is causing capitalization rates to fall and prices per square foot to rise 
specifically  our acquisition executives have a challenge identifying enough property at a price acceptable under our investment criteria to grow our overall investment banking investment services business 
higher revenues from this business increased net income and adjusted funds from operations affo during as begins  valuation levels for many top quality investment properties remain at historically high levels  with significant competition from a variety of capital sources to acquire them 
we continue to rely solely on our in house investment executives to access interested investors who have capital they can afford to place in an illiquid position for an indefinite period of time ie  invest in a sponsored reit 
we also continue to evaluate whether our in house sales force is capable  either through our existing client base or through new clients  of raising sufficient investment capital in sponsored reits to achieve future performance objectives 
critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations  and that require significant management estimates and judgments  are discussed below 
critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in sponsored reits and our investments in real property 
these policies affect our o allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on our recognition of rental income and depreciation and amortization expense  o assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets  o classification of leases  and o revenue recognition in the syndication of sponsored reits 
allocation of purchase price we have historically allocated the purchase prices of properties to land  buildings and improvements 
each component of purchase price generally has a different useful life 
for properties acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among land  buildings  improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of tenant relationships 
purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates 
under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations 
purchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant 
management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
purchase price allocated to above market leases is based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
purchase price allocated to in place leases and tenant relationships is determined as the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include i an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  including real estate taxes  insurance and other operating income and expenses  and ii costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
if future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
depreciation expense we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
costs incurred in connection with leasing primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the lease period 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
the capitalized above market lease values included in acquired real estate leases in our consolidated balance sheets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the value of above or below market leases is amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
the value of in place leases  exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases  is also amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs  or incorrect estimates of useful lives  could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods  as is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
impairment we periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include declining tenant occupancy  weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative  economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
lease classification some of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
revenue recognition we earn syndication and transaction fees in connection with the syndication of sponsored reits 
this revenue is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  and statement of position accounting for real estate syndication income 
revenue is recognized provided the criteria for sale accounting in sfas no 
are met 
accordingly  we recognize syndication fees related to commissions when shares of the sponsored reit are sold and the investor s funds have been transferred from escrow into our account 
we recognize transaction fees related to loan commitment and acquisition fees upon an investor closing and the subsequent payment of the sponsored reit s loan and fees payable to us 
other transaction fees are recognized upon the final closing of the syndication of the sponsored reit 
ownership of stock in a sponsored reit common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by the company 
following the commencement of syndication the company exercises influence over  but does not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
once under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative 
distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there is an asset held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we recognize our share of the operations during the period we consolidate and when the equity method is appropriate  as opposed to classifying the sponsored reits as discontinued operations  because we earn an ongoing asset and or property management fee from sponsored reits 
these ongoing fees  in addition to the influence that we exercise over the sponsored reit  constitute a continuing involvement between the company and the sponsored reit and preclude treatment as discontinued operations 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in two sponsored reits 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in these two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received are recognized as income 
we also agreed to vote our shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us  current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located 
recent declines in our occupancy percentages at some of our properties reflect current economic conditions and competition 
competition  economic conditions and other factors may cause additional occupancy declines in the future 
in the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
recent accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flow 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf regarding eitf no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination  or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease  be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june  the company has adopted eitf  which did not materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin was effective for the fiscal year ending december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations we operate in two business segments real estate operations and investment banking investment services 
we consider contribution from each segment in evaluating performance 
contribution includes revenue from each segment  less related expenses such as rental property operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  commissions and interest income and expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses arise primarily from corporate related expenses and costs associated with our headquarters in wakefield  massachusetts where both business segments are managed and can shift between the segments depending on the level of activity in each segment and other factors 
some of the more significant factors include o increases and decreases in the number of owned properties in our real estate portfolio  and the related impact of transactions such as direct acquisition and disposition of real estate assets  o increases and decreases in the number of sponsored reits  which are managed by the reit  and the related impact of creating the sponsored reits  o trends in the level of syndication proceeds in our investment banking segment  and o increases and decreases in the level of management time related to each of our segments 
as a result of these factors  we compare the total selling  general and administrative expenses from period to period as we believe it more meaningful than comparison of allocated expenses to each segment 
the following table shows each segment for the years ended december  and in thousands caption real estate operations change 
del revenues rental income    transaction fees    management fees and interest income from loans  expenses real estate operating expenses    real estate taxes and insurance    depreciation and amortization    interest  other items interest income    equity in earnings of non consolidated reit s contribution from real estate    investment banking investment services revenues syndication fees    transaction fees   other income expenses commissions   depreciation and amortization other items interest income taxes on income contribution from investment banking   selling  general and administrative expenses    income from continuing operations    discontinued operations  less applicable income tax income from discontinued operations    gain on sale of properties    net income    del 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the real estate segment includes operating results of properties held in our real estate portfolio  commitment fee income earned on real estate loans and development fees earned for services provided 
during we increased the real estate portfolio by four properties from the merger of the target reits and two properties by acquisitions completed during the year 
we also sold six properties in the second half of and reached an agreement to sell another property  which closed in the second quarter of as a result  as of december  we operated properties and had one property held for sale 
during we acquired the five target reits by merger  acquired three additional properties with cash  sold six properties and reached an agreement to sell another property  which closed on january  as a result  as of december  we operated properties and had one property held for sale 
acquisitions  mergers and dispositions in february  we acquired one commercial property in colorado  on april  we completed the acquisition by merger of the four target reits  and in july  we acquired one commercial property in indiana 
on february  we acquired one commercial property in texas  on april  we completed the acquisition by merger of the five target reits  on june  we acquired a commercial property in georgia and on december  we acquired a commercial property in broomfield  colorado 
the results of operations for each of the acquired or merged properties are included in our operating results as of their respective purchase or merger dates 
increases in rental revenues and expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in are primarily a result of the timing of these acquisitions and subsequent contribution of these acquired properties 
the operating results of the twelve properties sold and the property held for sale were classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
sales of real estate the sales of real estate in included the following 
on may  we sold an apartment building in katy  texas  and on may  we sold two commercial properties  one in santa clara  california and another in fairfax  virginia 
on august  we sold a commercial property in peabody  massachusetts  on november  we sold a commercial property in herndon  virginia and on december  we sold a commercial property in north andover  massachusetts 
as of december   we classified a property in greenville  south carolina as held for sale  which was sold on january  investment banking our investment banking investment services segment completed the syndication of two sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in compared to three sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in during the year ended december  we completed eight sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million 
the million increase in reversed the trend of declines noted in  which had been attributable to difficulty in finding properties that met our investment criteria  and is discussed above in trends and uncertainties investment banking investment services 
revenues and expenses for investment banking investment services are directly related to the gross proceeds of these syndications 
overview total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenue and expenses were primarily a result of acquisitions and mergers in our real estate segment discussed above and  to a lesser extent an increase in investment banking investment services contribution in compared to each segment is further discussed below 
real estate operations contribution from the real estate segment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to o an increase in real estate operating income of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for same period in we define real estate operating income as rental revenues less real estate operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance 
the increase was primarily a result of o real estate operating income from our acquisition of the four target reits by merger on april   acquisitions by direct purchase of properties in colorado during february  indiana during july  texas during february  our acquisition of the five target reits by merger on april   the acquisition of a property in georgia in late june and the acquisition of a property in colorado in late december real estate operating income from acquisitions is included in current operating income 
collectively  these acquisitions resulted in an increase in real estate operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and o lease termination payments of million during the year ended december   including million from a tenant in illinois  million from a tenant in colorado  million from a tenant in california  million from a tenant in indiana and million from a tenant in texas as compared to million during the year ended december   including million from a tenant at a property in texas  million from a property in california and million from a tenant in massachusetts 
o a decrease in interest expense of million resulting from a lower average loan balance outstanding for syndications in process during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a contributing factor was the use of our cash as a source of funds to finance a portion of the syndication of fsp phoenix tower corp  which was completed on september   and the syndication of fsp south tenth street corp  which was substantially completed on december  the decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates and loan fees in the period than the period 
o an increase to interest income of million during the year ended december   which was primarily a result of higher interest rates earned on higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and other investments compared to the year ended december  o a million increase in transaction loan commitment fees  which was principally a result of the increase in gross syndication proceeds in the year ended december  compared to the same period in o an increase in loan interest income of million principally as a result of increased loan interest income from interim mortgages made to sponsored reits and increases to overall interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these increases were partially offset by o an increase in depreciation expense of million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily a result of property acquisitions over the last twelve months 
o a decrease in equity in income from non consolidated reits of million  which was principally a result of the timing of investor closings on the syndications in process during the year ended december  compared to the syndications in process during the same period in investment banking investment services contribution of the investment banking investment services segment increased million to million for the year ended december  or compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to o an increase in syndication and transaction fee revenues of million  which was primarily attributable to the increase in gross syndication proceeds from which these revenues are based 
this increase was partially offset by o an increase in commission expense of million  which relates to the increase in gross syndication proceeds  and o an increase in tax expense of million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a greater taxable income from the investment banking and services business in compared to during and we had an effective tax rate of 
we expect an effective tax rate of approximately for our taxable reit subsidiary in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which was primarily a result of compensation and other costs relating to merger  acquisition and disposition activity and monitoring and managing a larger portfolio of reits 
we had approximately and employees  respectively as of december  and at our headquarters in wakefield  massachusetts 
income from continuing operations contribution from both segments  net of selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million to million compared to million for the reasons discussed above 
discontinued operations and gain on sale of properties during we sold six properties  each of which was sold at gains 
we also reached an agreement to sell another commercial property  located in greenville  south carolina  which closed on january  at a loss 
in evaluating the greenville  south carolina property  we compared estimated future costs to upgrade and reposition the multi tenant property and to lease up the building 
we concluded that accepting the offer was the more prudent decision because the management time and oversight of such a project outweighed the potential future benefit 
accordingly  as of december   each of the six properties sold and the property classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations on our financial statements 
income from discontinued operations of the seven properties was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  we reported million as gain on sale of properties including a provision for loss on the property held for sale 
for the year ended december  we reported million as net gains on sale of properties

investment banking our investment banking investment services segment completed the syndication of three sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in compared to eight sponsored reits with total gross proceeds of million in this decrease followed the trend noted in and and was attributable to continued difficulty in finding properties that met our investment criteria in  as compared to  and is discussed above in trends and uncertainties investment banking investment services

overview total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  total expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  each segment is discussed below 
real estate operations contribution from the real estate segment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to o an increase in real estate operating income of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period 
the increase primarily relates to the four properties from the merger of the target reits  which we acquired on april   and two properties acquired in colorado and indiana that were described earlier 
we define real estate operating income as rental revenues less real estate operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance  o an increase in management fees and interest income of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to interest income from sponsored reits  which had higher interest rates charged and larger loan balances outstanding for a longer period of time during the comparable periods  and  to a lesser extent increases to management fees earned from sponsored reits  o an increase from equity in income from non consolidated reits of million as a result of sponsored reits in syndication with greater net operating income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and o an increase in interest income of million during the year ended december   which was primarily a result of larger cash balances and higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by o a decrease in transaction fee revenues of million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally caused by the year over year decrease in gross syndication proceeds  o an increase in depreciation and amortization of million to million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which relates to the four properties from the merger of the target reits  which we acquired on april   and two properties acquired in colorado and indiana  and o an increase in interest expense of million resulting from higher interest rates and larger loan balances outstanding for assets acquired during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  investment banking investment services contribution of the investment banking investment services segment was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to o a decrease in syndication fee revenues of million  which was primarily attributable to the continued difficulty in finding properties that met our investment criteria in  as compared to  discussed above in trends and uncertainties investment banking investment services 
this decrease was partially offset by o a decrease in commission expense of million  which relates to the decrease in gross syndication proceeds  o a decrease in tax expense of million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a lower taxable income from the investment banking and services business in compared to during we had an effective tax rate of compared to for the effective rate in was lower as a result of an adjustment to the statutory rate to better reflect the benefit of lower tax rates at lower levels of taxable income  and o a decrease in interest income of  to  for the year ended december  compared to  primarily as a result of lower cash balances and lower gross syndication proceeds in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which increase was primarily a result of compensation and other costs relating to monitoring and managing a larger portfolio of reits and expenses related to having a publicly traded stock  which commenced on june  these increases were partially offset by decreases to professional fees related to an investor related project completed in we had and employees  respectively as of december  and at our headquarters in wakefield  massachusetts 
income from continuing operations contribution from both segments  net of selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million to million compared to million in for the reasons discussed above 
discontinued operations and gain on sale of properties during we sold six properties  each of which was sold at gains 
we also reached an agreement to sell another commercial property  located in greenville  south carolina  which closed on january  at a loss 
these sales affect the and presentation  as prior year results from each property are reclassified as discontinued operations 
during june an agreement was reached to sell a property called blue ravine  which is located in folsom  california 
the sale was completed on july  and resulted in a loss of approximately million 
the property had been vacant since mid the offer to purchase the property was compared to estimated future costs to convert the property from a single tenant to a multi tenant facility and lease the building 
we concluded that accepting the offer was the more prudent decision because the management time and oversight of such a conversion outweighed the potential future benefit 
on september   we recorded a non monetary exchange gain of million from contribution of acres of developable land we contributed in exchange for preferred shares approximately of a sponsored reit  fsp park ten development corp 
park ten development 
the appraised value of the land and market value of the stock acquired were used to estimate the sale price  and the gain was recorded net of the company s interest in park ten development 
also during september we sold a residential property called mansions in the park  which is located in baton rouge  louisiana  and sold by transfer of our interest in a wholly owned subsidiary that held an office property called gateway crossing  which is located in columbia  maryland at gains  which aggregated approximately million 
during october we sold two residential properties called essex house and gael apartments  which are located adjacent to each other in houston  texas  and in december we sold an office property called telecom business center in san diego  california 
all of these properties were sold at gains which aggregated approximately million 
accordingly  as of december   all of the sold properties and the property classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations on our financial statements 
income from discontinued operations of the properties was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  we reported million as net gains on sale of properties 
during there were no assets sold 
net income the resulting net income for the year ending december  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
this increase of million is attributable to million provided by operating activities  and million provided by investing activities  less million used for financing activities 
presentation of our consolidated statements of cash flows combines cash flows from continuing operations with those of discontinued operations 
where significant  cash flows from discontinued operations are discussed below 
management believes that existing cash  cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations  cash anticipated to be generated by the sale of preferred stock in future sponsored reits and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
operating activities the cash provided by our operating activities of million  which includes million from the discontinued operations from sales of real estate assets and the property held for sale  is primarily attributable to net income of million excluding non cash activity  consisting primarily of the gain on sale of real estate assets net of a provision for loss on a property held for sale of million  depreciation and amortization of million  less payment of deferred leasing commissions of approximately million and uses arising from other current accounts of million 
investing activities our cash provided by investing activities of million is attributable to the proceeds from sale of properties of million  plus cash acquired through our merger transaction that was completed on april  of million  less uses of million for acquisitions and additions to real estate investments and office equipment  which includes million in additions made to properties sold during  plus an investment in a certificate of deposit of million and an investment in non consolidated reits of million  plus costs paid related to the merger of million  less changes in deposits on real estate assets of million 
financing activities our cash used by financing activities of million is attributable to approximately million of distributions to shareholders and offering costs associated with the merger of million 
line of credit we have a revolving line of credit agreement with a group of banks providing for borrowings of up to million 
during august the line of credit was amended and restated  and the maturity date was extended to august  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at either the bank s prime rate at december  or a rate equal to libor plus basis points at december  
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at december  however  on january  we borrowed the entire million for the purpose of making an interim mortgage loan to a sponsored reit  which acquired a property on january  we are in compliance with all bank covenants required by the line of credit 
contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
assets held for syndication as of december  and  respectively  there were no assets held for syndication

related party transactions to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  other considerations we generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties 
for the years ending december  and  the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property  with the exception of a property located in westford  massachusetts  a property located in santa clara  california that was sold on may  and a property located in folsom  california that was sold on july  the property located in westford  massachusetts had a single tenant lease  which expired on october  we have not re let this property and expect that it will not produce revenue to cover its expenses in the first quarter of the westford  massachusetts property had operating expenses of approximately  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company received a restoration and settlement payment from a tenant at the property located in westford  massachusetts of  operating expenses  net of the restoration and settlement payment were approximately  the property located in santa clara  california had been vacant since october and had operating expenses of  for the five month period ending through may  on which date the property was sold

the operating leases in the table above consist of our lease of corporate office space  which was amended in the lease includes a base annual rent and additional rent for our share of taxes and operating costs 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in sponsored reits as part of our business model we organize single purpose entities that own real estate  purchases of which are financed through the private placement of equity in those entities  typically through syndication 
we call these entities sponsored reits  and they are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts 
we earn fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the sponsored reits in these syndications 
the sponsored reits issue both common stock and preferred stock 
the common stock is owned solely by fsp corp 
generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors  however  on three occasions we acquired an interest in preferred shares of three sponsored reits 
in addition  two non management directors of fsp corp  have from time to time invested in sponsored reits and may do so again in the future 
following consummation of the offerings  the preferred stockholders in each of the sponsored reits are entitled to of the sponsored reit s cash distributions 
subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  except for the preferred stock we own  we do not share in any of a sponsored reit s earnings  or any related dividend  and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk 
prior to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  we share in a sponsored reit s earnings and related dividends to the extent of our ownership interest in the sponsored reit 
as a common stockholder  upon completion of the syndication  we have no rights to the sponsored reit s earnings or any related cash distributions 
however  upon liquidation of a sponsored reit  we are entitled to our percentage interest in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment 
our percentage interest in each sponsored reit is less than 
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the sponsored reit s preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger  sale of property  amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock 
in addition  all of the sponsored reits allow the holders of more than of the outstanding preferred shares to remove without cause and replace one or more members of that sponsored reit s board of directors 
common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by us 
following the commencement of syndication we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative and distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there are assets held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
we have acquired a preferred stock interest in three sponsored reits  one of which was included in the target reits that the company acquired by merger on april   that was accounted for as a purchase  and the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair value 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in the remaining two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received are recognized as income 
we also agreed to vote our shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the sponsored reits 
these investments are included in our financial statements 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits nine of which were fully syndicated  and one was substantially syndicated  from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  all of which were fully syndicated and from which we no longer share economic benefit or risk 
at december   we held a common stock interest in sponsored reits  of which were fully syndicated and we no longer shared economic benefit or risk 
the value of the two entities which were not fully syndicated was approximately million and was shown on the consolidated balance sheets as assets held for syndication 
the table below shows our income and expenses from sponsored reits 
management fees of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and interest expense related to the company s mortgage on properties is eliminated in consolidation 
year ended december  in thousands operating data rental revenues   operating and maintenance expenses  depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income during the years ended december   and  we recorded equity in earnings of sponsored reits following the commencement of syndication of   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at or during the year ended december  we borrow from time to time on our line of credit 
these borrowings bear interest at the bank s base rate at december  or at libor plus basis points at december   as elected by us when requesting funds as defined 
as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
we have used funds drawn on our line of credit for the purpose of making interim mortgage loans to sponsored reits and for interim financing of acquisitions 
generally interim mortgage loans bear interest at the same variable rate payable by us under our line of credit 
we therefore believe that we have mitigated our interest rate risk with respect to our borrowings for interim mortgage loans 
historically we have satisfied obligations arising from interim financing of acquisitions through cash or sale of properties in our portfolio  so we believe that we can mitigate interest rate risk with respect to borrowings for interim financing of acquisitions as well
