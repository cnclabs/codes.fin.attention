item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we concluded a difficult year in following a strong first half  we experienced a slow down in retail performance resulting from a shift from limited edition line extensions to more sustainable new product platforms which took longer than expected 
in addition  our base business sales were negatively impacted in the second half of the year by poor merchandising activity 
results for  excluding items affecting comparability as indicated below  fell short of our long term goals and were below expectations 
net sales were impacted by slower retail takeaway and a decline in market share during the second half of the year  primarily in our north american chocolate business 
income per share diluted was impacted by the lower than expected sales growth  increased costs for product obsolescence associated with the shift to new product platforms and increased expenses for advertising and consumer programs during the fourth quarter to regain marketplace momentum 
a product recall and temporary plant closure in canada also negatively impacted our results for the year 
we plan to accelerate growth in by focusing on increasing sales of our core confectionery products  revitalizing our iconic brands through increased advertising and increased consumer and customer support  and by expanding our innovative new product platforms based on consumer preferences 
adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 
 required companies to change the accounting principle used for evaluating the effect of possible prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
as a result  we changed one of the five criteria of our revenue recognition policy to delay the recognition of revenue on goods in transit until they are received by our customers 
we also made adjustments to correct certain liabilities as of december   along with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings for all years presented in this report 
adjustments were made to liabilities primarily associated with business acquisitions and divestitures occurring prior to as permitted by sab no 
 we adjusted our financial statements for all prior periods to provide comparability 
these adjustments were not material to our results of operations or financial condition in any period presented in this report 
non gaap financial measures items affecting comparability our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for each of these non gaap financial measures  we are providing below the most directly comparable gaap measure  a reconciliation of the differences between the non gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure  an explanation of why our management believes these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors  and additional purposes for which we use these non gaap measures 
we believe that the disclosure of these non gaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year to year operating results 
we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes ebit  net income and income per share diluted when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally  and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business 
we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 
items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in    and associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the business realignment initiatives and note contains information about the income tax provision adjustment

sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase 
sales in also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the united states implemented in  substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in mexico also contributed to the sales increase 
these increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in canada  partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier 
compared with business acquisitions  primarily mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa and grupo lorena  contributed approximately of the increase in net sales from approximately two thirds of the additional sales increase of resulted from unit volume growth  primarily reflecting the introduction of new products and limited edition items 
improved performance by our canadian and mexican businesses and exports to asia and latin america also contributed to this increase 
the remaining sales increase resulted from selling price increases  a lower rate of promotional spending  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international businesses 
key marketplace metrics for the weeks ended december  consumer takeaway increase market share decrease increase consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately of our us confectionery retail business 
these channels of distribution include food  drug  mass merchandisers  including wal mart stores  inc  and convenience stores 
the change in market share is provided for measured channels which include sales in the food  drug  convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade  excluding sales of wal mart stores  inc cost of sales and gross margin compared with the sales volume increase  higher energy  raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for higher costs associated with obsolete  aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset somewhat by reductions in us manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of million in resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives 
business realignment charges of million were included in cost of sales in reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in las piedras  puerto rico 
gross margin in was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials  increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix 
these were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity 
our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin percentage point in and reduced gross margin by percentage points in compared with business realignment charges increased cost of sales by million 
higher sales volume  business acquisitions and higher raw material costs  in addition to higher labor  overhead and distribution costs primarily caused the remainder of the increase 
a less favorable product mix  primarily associated with the lower margin mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses  and the impact of business realignment charges reduced our gross margin by percentage points 
improved price realization  primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for our international businesses  more than offset the impact of higher raw material  labor and overhead costs  and sales of certain new products which had lower margins 
selling  marketing and administrative compared with selling  marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our business realignment initiatives 
reduced advertising expense in was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses 
compared with selling  marketing and administrative expenses increased during this period primarily due to increased performance based employee compensation costs  including stock based compensation 
business acquisition expenses and consumer promotions expenses also increased  but were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses 
business realignment initiatives in july  we announced initiatives intended to advance our value enhancing strategy the business realignment initiatives 
we also announced that we would record a total pre tax charge of approximately million to million  or 
to 
per share diluted in connection with the business realignment initiatives 
our business realignment initiatives were complete as of december  charges credits associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during and were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars cost of sales business realignment initiatives previous business realignment initiatives total cost of sales selling  marketing and administrative business realignment initiatives business realignment and asset impairments  net business realignment initiatives us voluntary workforce reduction program us facility rationalization las piedras  puerto rico plant streamline international operations primarily canada previous business realignment initiatives total business realignment and asset impairments  net total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives the credit of million recorded in cost of sales during for the business realignment initiatives related to higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the las piedras  puerto rico plant 
the charge recorded in selling  marketing and administrative expenses resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease 
the net business realignment and asset impairments charges recorded during included million for involuntary terminations relating to organizational changes 
during  we recorded charges credits related to previous business realignment initiatives that began in and these charges credits were recorded to finalize the sale of certain properties  adjust previously recorded liabilities  and reflect the impact of an employment complaint arising from the business realignment initiatives 
during  eight former employees filed a complaint in federal court in colorado alleging we discriminated against them based on age 
we do not expect any significant impact as a result of this case 
the million recorded in cost of sales in resulted from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the las piedras manufacturing facility 
the business realignment and asset impairments charge in included million for involuntary termination benefits primarily for las piedras plant employees 
changes in liabilities recorded for the business realignment initiatives were as follows accrued liabilities balance utilization during new charges during balance in thousands of dollars voluntary workforce reduction facility rationalization streamline international operations total income before interest and income taxes and ebit margin compared with ebit increased in compared with  primarily as a result of lower net business realignment charges associated primarily with the business realignment initiatives 
net pre tax business realignment charges of million were recorded in compared with million recorded in  a decrease of million 
the remainder of the increase in ebit was attributable to lower selling  marketing and administrative expenses which were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from higher input costs and the impact of product obsolescence 
net business realignment charges reduced ebit margin by percentage points in and percentage points in the remainder of the improvement in ebit margin reflected lower selling  marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
compared with ebit decreased from to as a result of net charges of million related to the business realignment initiatives recorded in the impact of the business realignment charges was substantially offset by an increase in ebit of million resulting from the sales volume growth and net price realization which more than offset higher input costs and an increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
ebit margin declined in primarily due to our mauna loa and grupo lorena businesses  which had lower margins  and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced ebit margin by percentage points 
also contributing to the ebit margin decline were higher raw material  labor and overhead costs  and sales of certain new products that had lower margins 
improved price realization  improved profitability from our international businesses and lower selling  marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales offset percentage point of the ebit margin decline 
interest expense  net compared with net interest expense was higher in than the comparable period of  primarily reflecting higher interest expense resulting from commercial paper borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock and working capital requirements  along with significant contributions to our pension plans in late higher interest rates in also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
compared with net interest expense was higher in primarily due to higher short term interest expense and decreased capitalized interest 
the increase in interest expense was primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings to finance stock repurchases and contributions to our pension plans  in addition to higher interest rates 
income taxes and effective tax rate compared with our effective income tax rate was for and compared with the effective income tax rate for benefited by percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment charges 
our effective income tax rate for was not comparable to because in we settled federal tax audits for the and tax years and resolved several state tax audit issues 
our provision for income taxes was reduced by million from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves related to those years 
the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses  interest on potential assessments  and acquisition and divestiture matters 
the reduction in the provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by percentage points 
net income and net income per share compared with net income in was reduced by million  or 
per share diluted  and in was reduced by million  or 
per share diluted  as a result of net charges associated with our business realignment initiatives which were recorded in each year 
in addition to the impact of the business realignment initiatives  earnings per share diluted in increased primarily as a result of lower selling  marketing and administrative expenses which more than offset the impact of reduced gross profit 
the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding  net of higher interest expense  also contributed to the increase in earnings per share diluted in compared with net income for was unfavorably impacted by total charges associated with the business realignment initiatives of million before tax  million after tax or 
per share diluted 
net income for was favorably impacted by million  or 
per share diluted  because of the adjustment to the federal and state income tax contingency reserves 
financial condition our financial condition remained strong during solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity  leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies

assets a summary of our assets is as follows december  in thousands of dollars current assets property  plant and equipment  net goodwill and other intangibles other assets total assets the change in current assets from to was primarily due to the following higher cash and cash equivalents in due to the timing of cash collections  an increase in accounts receivable in resulting from the timing of sales in december  an increase in inventories reflecting higher raw material inventories to support manufacturing requirements  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflecting the implementation of sfas no 
and lower prepaid selling and marketing expenses  partially offset by a receivable of approximately million related to the recovery of damages resulting from the product recall in canada 
property  plant and equipment was lower in primarily due to depreciation expense of million and asset retirements  partially offset by capital additions 
the change in other assets in was primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
which resulted in the reclassification of million of assets related to our pension plans to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
liabilities a summary of our liabilities is as follows december  in thousands of dollars current liabilities long term debt other long term liabilities deferred income taxes total liabilities changes in current liabilities from to were primarily the result of the following lower accounts payable reflecting the timing of payments in december  reduced accrued liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives  incentive compensation and marketing programs  and higher current portion of long term debt  substantially offset by the refinancing of commercial paper borrowings upon the issuance of long term debt 
the increase in long term debt in resulted from the issuance of million of notes in august  discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section 
this increase was reduced by the reclassification of notes and certain lease obligations to current portion of long term debt 
the increase in other long term liabilities in was principally associated with the recording of liabilities for post retirement benefits upon adoption of sfas no 
the decrease in deferred taxes in was primarily associated with the tax effect of the reclassification of assets related to our pension plans and liabilities recorded for our post retirement benefit plans upon adoption of sfas no 
capital structure we have two classes of stock outstanding  common stock and class b stock 
holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders  including the election of directors 
holders of the common stock have one vote per share 
holders of the class b stock have ten votes per share 
holders of the common stock  voting separately as a class  are entitled to elect one sixth of our board of directors 
with respect to dividend rights  holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock 
hershey trust company  as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the milton hershey school trust maintains voting control over the hershey company 
however  the milton hershey school trust has not taken an active role in setting our policy  nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management 
the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june  but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september after terminating the sale process  the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general 
subsequently  pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company 
the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede  and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations 
this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
in december  our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement rights agreement 
the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement 
this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company 
under the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right right for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends 
the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect  will not affect reported earnings per share  is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded 
we discuss the rights agreement in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns  timing of new product introductions  profit margins and price changes 
sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday related sales patterns 
generally  working capital needs peak during the summer months 
we meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided from used by operating activities were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars net income depreciation and amortization stock based compensation and excess tax benefits deferred income taxes business realignment initiatives  net of tax contributions to pension plans working capital changes in other assets and liabilities net cash provided from operating activities over the past three years  cash from operating activities provided approximately billion 
the change in cash used by provided from deferred income taxes primarily reflected the tax impact of higher pension plan contributions in and the adjustment of income tax contingency reserves in in  we adjusted deferred income taxes primarily to reflect the deferred tax benefit resulting from a million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of deferred income taxes in also reflected an increase resulting from the mauna loa acquisition 
these adjustments represented non cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities 
we contributed million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status 
as of december   the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded benefits obligations by million 
over the three year period  cash provided from or used by working capital tended to fluctuate due to sales during december and inventory management practices 
during the three year period  changes in other assets and liabilities primarily related to hedging transactions and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities associated with selling and marketing programs  incentive compensation and income taxes 
the increase in income taxes paid in compared with primarily reflected significantly lower tax deductions in for pension plan contributions

we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity 
in december  we entered into a five year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to billion  with an option to increase borrowings to billion with the consent of the lenders 
we may use these funds for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and a financial covenant 
as of december   we complied with all of these covenants 
this facility replaced our previous million revolving credit facility entered into in november in march  we entered into a short term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to million through september in september  we entered into an agreement amending the short term facility 
the amended agreement reduced the credit limit from million to million and expired on december  we used the funds for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper backstop 
we entered into this agreement because we expected borrowings to exceed the million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time 
in september  we entered into a short term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to million 
the agreement expired in december we used the funds for general corporate purposes 
we entered into this facility because we expected borrowings in late to exceed the million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time 
borrowing increased due to the retirement of million of notes in october  refinancing of certain consolidated lease arrangements  contributions to our pension plans  stock repurchases and seasonal working capital needs 
in november  we entered into a five year credit agreement under which we could borrow up to million with an option to increase borrowings by an additional million with concurrence by the lenders

registration statements in september  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s that was declared effective in january under this registration statement  we could offer on a delayed or continuous basis up to million aggregate principal amount of additional debt securities the million shelf registration statement 
in may  we filed a new shelf registration statement on form s that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
this registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under new securities and exchange commission regulations governing well known seasoned issuers the wksi registration statement 
the wksi registration statement replaces  and will be used in lieu of  the million shelf registration statement for offerings of debt securities occurring subsequent to may in august  we issued million of notes due september   and million of notes due september  these notes were issued under the wksi registration statement 
proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the wksi registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements 
these may include reducing existing borrowings  financing capital additions  funding contributions to our pension plans  future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations non cancelable operating leases long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 
purchase obligations we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers 
these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations 
total obligations for each year presented above consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december  the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods 
increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts 
this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december  and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts 
taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 
lease arrangement with special purpose trust in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation no 

interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special purpose entities spes  such as special purpose trusts spts  to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 
we adopted interpretation no 
as of june   resulting in the consolidation of off balance sheet arrangements with spts 
as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
in december  we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in redlands  california 
the lease term was approximately ten years  with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility 
the lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility 
in january  we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement 
the term of this lease agreement was five years  with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 
the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility  including land  was million 
we exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of million at the end of the lease term in january asset retirement obligations our company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities 
our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations 
current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished 
we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities 
we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and  therefore  sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos 
income tax obligations we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we determine the reserves based upon our judgment of assessment risk 
we adjust the reserves  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
a settlement of federal tax audits for the and tax years  as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of based upon the results of the audits  we reduced our income tax contingency reserves by million 
this reflected a reduction of the provision for income taxes by million and a reduction to goodwill of million 
the reserve adjustment related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses  interest on potential assessments  and acquisition and divestiture matters 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments we use certain derivative instruments  from time to time  including interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures contracts  to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures 
these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods 
these futures contracts are intended to be  and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 
accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 
 as amended 
sfas no 
 as amended  provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income 
we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet 
for fair value hedges  we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
as of december   we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments  including foreign exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures contracts  as cash flow hedges 
we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  as of january  additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  we determined the fair value of long term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands of dollars except for rates long term debt interest rate we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december  interest rate swaps in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in december  we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to million of term financing to be executed during in february  we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge 
in august  a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of million of year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of million 
the million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the million of notes due september  in october  we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on long term debt from fixed to variable rates 
we converted interest payments on million of notes due in october and million of notes due in march from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate  libor 
in march  we terminated these agreements  resulting in cash receipts totaling million  with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long term debt 
we are amortizing or have amortized this increase over the remaining terms of the respective long term debt as a reduction to interest expense 
the fair value of interest rate swaps equals the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period 
we calculate the fair value of the swap agreements quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments 
as of december   we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with interest rate swaps is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of forward swap agreements liability potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates foreign exchange forward contracts and options we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment  raw materials and finished goods 
we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from to months 
foreign exchange forward contracts and options are effective as hedges of identifiable  foreign currency commitments 
we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives 
the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and options and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows december  contract amount primary currencies contract amount primary currencies in millions of dollars foreign exchange forward contracts and options to purchase foreign currencies australian dollars canadian dollars euros australian dollars british sterling euros we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period 
we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts and options is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options asset potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodities price risk management and futures contracts our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa  sugar  milk  peanuts and almonds 
the cost of cocoa beans and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors 
these factors include the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  and speculative influences 
during  cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between and per pound  based on the new york board of trade futures contract 
our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices  premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times  and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans 
we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for to months 
we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements 
we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs 
our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs  but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the new york board of trade or various other exchanges 
these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses 
we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income 
the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs 
futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 
sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent  based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities 
inventories  priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
we define a loss  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices  including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change in millions of dollars highest long position lowest long position average position long the increase in fair values from to primarily reflected an increase in net commodity positions 
the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 
sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected 
factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  speculative influences  and changes in our hedging strategies 
use of estimates and other critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in various instances  gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following accounts receivable trade accrued liabilities pension and other post retirement benefit plans goodwill and other intangible assets commodities futures contracts management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable trade in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria 
our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company  inc  one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores  drug stores  wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers 
mclane company  inc accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  as of december   no other customer accounted for more than of our total accounts receivable 
we believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 
accounts receivable trade  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  were net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historical trends  and evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable  assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 
information on our accounts receivable trade  related expenses and assumptions is as follows for the three year period in millions of dollars  except percents average expense for potential uncollectible accounts average write offs of uncollectible accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable we recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling  marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
if we made reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable  our annual provision could change within the following range a reduction in expense of approximately million  and an increase in expense of approximately million 
changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 
information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars promotional costs we determine the amount of the accrued liability by analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar  previously offered programs 
the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range a reduction in costs of approximately million an increase in costs of approximately million changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes 
over the three year period ended december   actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 
changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products at the time of sale  we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 
estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs 
over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 
million to million 
over the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than 
reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans overview we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees 
these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees 
we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans  as well as recent court cases  for any impact on our plans 
we also sponsor two primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws 
for years beginning after  we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
we broadly diversify our pension plan assets  consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations consider payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
we take into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  we take into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other post retirement benefit plan  such as a retiree health care plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition asset or obligation 
we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
was as follows incremental effect of applying sfas no 
on individual line items in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in thousands of dollars before application of sfas no 
adjustments increase decrease after application of sfas no 
prepaid expenses and other current assets other assets total assets accrued liabilities other long term liabilities deferred income taxes total liabilities accumulated other comprehensive loss total stockholders equity pension plans our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic pension benefit costs assumptions average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation asset return assumptions net periodic pension benefit costs we expect net periodic pension benefit income in primarily due to the better than expected asset return in  the modifications announced in october which will reduce future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan  the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan  and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december  the recognized net actuarial losses will be lower in primarily due to the better than expected asset return in actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations 
we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains losses in excess of of a respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or the fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs for is million 
this amount was based on the december  unrecognized net actuarial loss of million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years 
we present the unrecognized net actuarial loss in note  pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
the thirteen to fifteen year amortization period equals the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans average remaining service period 
changes to the assumed rates of participant termination  disability and retirement would affect the average remaining service period 
an increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect 
however  we anticipate no changes to the assumed rates at this time 
the recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs was million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
average discount rate assumption net periodic benefit costs the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations 
in order to estimate this rate for  a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 
in and  we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions 
high quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency 
the duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit cost by million 
average discount rate assumption benefit obligations the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above 
we increased our discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
asset return assumptions we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was as follows for the years ended december  actual return on assets the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by million 
a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit cost by million 
our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows asset class allocation range equity securities debt securities cash and certain other investments as of december   actual allocations were within the specified ranges 
we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 
for and  minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material 
however  we made contributions of million in and million in to improve the funded status 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans 
for  there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non domestic plans will not be material 
post retirement benefit plans other post retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic other post retirement benefit cost assumptions average discount rate assumption the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post retirement benefit cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
other post retirement benefit obligation assumptions were as follows december  in millions of dollars other post retirement benefit obligation assumptions benefit obligations discount rate assumption a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill  the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 
we use a two step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 
the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets  patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions 
we amortize customer related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and  therefore  we do not amortize them 
we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows 
we completed our annual impairment tests and determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired as of december   and commodities futures contracts we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases  provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations 
accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net after tax gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income hedge ineffectiveness gains losses recognized in cost of sales  before tax we reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in cost of sales 
no gains or losses on commodities futures contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur 
we recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment 
the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts and options  and commodities futures contracts  expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately million after tax as of december  this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 
return measures we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital 
these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the six year consolidated financial summary on page with the directly comparable non gaap operating return measures 
the non gaap operating return measures are calculated using non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability 
a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages and  along with the reasons why we believe that the use of non gaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 
operating return on average stockholders equity operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
to calculate non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity  we define non gaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items 
these items include the following amortization of indefinite lived intangibles for all years after tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in after tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our company in after tax gain on the sale of the luden s throat drops business in our operating return on average stockholders equity  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity was in the increase in operating return on average stockholders equity in was principally due to a reduction in equity resulting from share repurchases and the adoption of sfas no 
over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from in to in operating return on average invested capital operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital 
average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long term debt  deferred income taxes and stockholders equity 
for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  earnings is defined as net income less the after tax effect of interest on long term debt 
for the calculation of the non gaap operating return measure  we define earnings as net income adjusted to exclude the following amortization of indefinite lived intangibles for all years after tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in after tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our company in after tax gain on the sale of the luden s throat drops business in after tax effect of interest on long term debt our operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average invested capital was in over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from in to in and outlook the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
refer to risk factors on page for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 
during the three years ended december   we have improved operating results as we implemented our business strategies 
over the long term  our strategies seek to achieve the following goals  excluding items affecting comparability net sales growth of per year  annual growth in ebit of  improvement in ebit margin of basis points per year  and eps growth of per year 
our focus in includes enhancing the relevance of our products  extending our reach and enabling our growth 
key priorities include the following accelerating core brand growth  investing in innovative new product platforms  refocusing snack adjacencies  disciplined global expansion  and providing affordability by expanding gross margin 
we expect sales growth in to be within our long term goal of to 
our top priority is restoring and accelerating core brand growth  with renewed emphasis on our iconic brands  particularly kisses  hershey s and reese s 
investment in these brands will double in with enhanced advertising  increased consumer support and powerful in store merchandising 
emphasis during will also be focused on on trend growth platforms that leverage our iconic brands  our confectionery and nut expertise and our marketplace scale 
the primary growth platforms that we will focus on in are dark and premium chocolate  refreshment products  health and wellness products  and substantial snacks 
growth in the dark and premium chocolate platform will be driven by the cacao reserve by hershey s product line introduced in  sales growth for hershey s extra dark and special dark products  and expansion of sales of scharffen berger and joseph schmidt dark and premium chocolates 
increases in sales of refreshment products are expected from ice breakers gum and mint items  driven by the introduction of new gum and mint sours products 
york chocolate covered chewy mints  introduced in late  will also contribute to sales increases in increased sales for our health and wellness product platform will be generated by sixty calorie and one hundred calorie portion control products that leverage our scale brands  along with incremental sales of the dagoba organic chocolates business acquired in late growth will also be contributed from the introduction of ice breakers mint and gum products that contain vitamin c  ginseng and antioxidants 
growth in the substantial snack platform is anticipated from sales of new layered sandwich cookies  single serve soft cookies and brownies primarily under the hershey s and reese s brand names 
sales increases are also expected from our really nuts product line in over time  we will focus on disciplined global expansion in selected high potential markets with a regionally relevant product portfolio 
geographically  we expect future net sales growth to be concentrated primarily in emerging markets in asia  particularly india and china  mexico and selected markets in south america 
we intend to focus on growth from our large scale brands  expand our sales to global customers and develop region specific business systems and alliances 
we expect a return to gross margin expansion in  excluding items affecting comparability 
we expect higher input costs in  compared with  although to a lesser extent than the cost increases in compared with the amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs that we have not fully hedged 
we utilize forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintain a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies 
we expect to offset these cost increases through a combination of the following improved sales mix from higher margin single serve products and new product platforms  reduced costs for product obsolescence  effective procurement strategies  continued improvements in supply chain productivity  and cost control initiatives 
ebit is expected to grow to in  excluding items affecting comparability 
net sales growth and gross margin expansion will be substantially offset by increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising  along with investment in our international businesses 
ebit margin is expected to be flat in  excluding items affecting comparability 
ebit margin is affected by the following factors selling prices  promotional allowances  raw material and other input costs  supply chain efficiencies  the mix of products sold in any period  investment in advertising and consumer marketing programs  and selling and administrative expenses 
improvement in gross margin resulting from a more profitable sales mix and continued enhancement of supply chain productivity is expected to be offset by increased brand investment and the impact of our expanded international operations 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of sales during this is expected to result from increased advertising and consumer marketing expenses  and improvements in retail coverage and technology  along with the restoration of certain administrative expenses that were unusually low during because of our business realignment initiatives and lower than expected performance 
net income and eps in were unfavorably impacted by the business realignment initiatives 
excluding the impact of business realignment initiatives  net income is expected to increase to and eps is expected to increase within a range of to for the full year  reflecting the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases 
we expect strong cash flows from operating activities in net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions  capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments 
we will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate 
the plans were sufficiently funded at the end of we do not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock during under the million share repurchase program approved in december subsequent events in january  our company and lotte confectionery co  ltd  korea s leading confectionery and ice cream manufacturer  announced a manufacturing joint venture in china that will produce hershey and lotte products for the market in china 
the manufacturing agreement is part of a strategic alliance that enables the companies to explore opportunities for marketing and distribution of products in asia and the united states 
the manufacturing facility  located in jinshan  near shanghai  will make a variety of hershey s  hershey s kisses and reese s products and is expected to be in operation by june  with products available in retail locations in china by august as part of the agreement  we will provide lotte with expertise and distribution capabilities in the united states and will help test and distribute lotte s xylitol gum and a variety of other refreshment products 
in february  our board of directors approved a comprehensive  three year supply chain transformation program 
we expect to complete this program by december  when completed  this program will greatly enhance our manufacturing  sourcing and customer service capabilities  and will generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives 
these initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core us business  creation of innovative new product platforms to meet consumer and customer needs  and disciplined global expansion 
under the program  which we will implement in stages over the next three years  we will significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than one third  outsource production of low value added items  and  construct a flexible  cost effective production facility in monterrey  mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs 
the result of our transformation program will be a flexible  global supply chain capable of delivering our iconic brands  in a wide range of affordable items and assortments  across retail channels in our priority markets 
we will source finished products from fewer facilities  each one a center of excellence specializing in our proprietary product technologies 
increased access to borderless sourcing will further leverage our manufacturing scale within a lower overall cost structure 
we have developed a phased  three year plan to ensure smooth implementation and to maintain product quality and customer service 
the program will result in a total net reduction of approximately  positions across our supply chain over the next three years 
when completed  manufacturing of approximately percent of our production volume will take place in the us and canada
