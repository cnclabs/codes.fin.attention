item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company earns revenue by the movement of freight by water to and from puerto rico from the continental united states through its terminal facility in jacksonville  florida 
the company also earns revenue from the movement of freight within the continental united states by truck when such movement complements its core business of moving freight to and from puerto rico 
the company s operating expenses consist of the cost of the equipment  labor  facilities  fuel and administrative support necessary to move freight to and from puerto rico and within the continental united states 
during the company experienced a decline in operating income and the resulting operating ratio which was primarily due to expensing the cost of the required regulatory dry docking of its two ro ro vessels that occurred during the first half of the year as well as a significant increase in rent expense on vessels and equipment 
this dry docking expense and the associated disruption to the company s normal sailing schedule resulted in markedly different operating results in the second half of compared to the first half and that difference is highlighted following the discussion of overall results below

total revenue change 
the increase in core container and trailer revenue  and other revenue is primarily due to increases in accessorial charges and freight rates partially offset by volume decreases 
vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during southbound trailer and container volume remained relatively stable but vessel capacity utilization decreased due to a decrease in the auto and other cargo volume southbound 
the company expects auto volume to increase as a result of contracts signed during the fourth quarter of that commence in the increase in other revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in fuel surcharges 
the company s fuel surcharge is included in the company s revenues and amounted to million in and million in demurrage  a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time  is also included in the company s revenues and amounted to million in in comparison to million in total charterhire revenue amounted to million in and million in charterhire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service

valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management considered such factors as cumulative earnings history in addition to projected results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
management concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset would be realized and adjusted the valuation allowance accordingly 
the most weight is given to near term budgets and this reduction was calculated by applying a tax rate to the business plan 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  including a million decrease in the valuation allowance during the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above  the company reported a slight net loss of  or

per share  basic  at december  page the financial information provided below reflects the company s operating results based on the company s election in a prior year to account for its dry docking cost using the expense as incurred method 
management believes that the operating results should be adjusted utilizing the defer and amortize method of accounting so as not to distort the operating results due to a dry docking expense that occurs once every five years 
as a result of the company s election to use the preferable expense as incurred method  the company is not permitted to change to a less preferable method even though it is predominantly used by its competitors 
however  the company believes this is a meaningful disclosure because i during accounting periods where multiple dry dockings are performed  operating results are not comparable to prior periods or to industry peers  and management and the company s board of directors believe providing this measure to shareholders will assist them in making meaningful industry comparisons  ii both of the company s ro ro vessels underwent regulatory dry dockings in the first half of note that the dry docking cost related to the ro ro vessels that have three decks  each long are significantly more than the cost of dry docking the tbc vessels that have a single deck that is long and were built more recently than the ro ro vessels  iii the defer and amortize method of accounting for dry docking cost is the predominant method used by the company s industry peer group  and iv the company s board of directors and management team evaluates the company s operating performance compared to the industry peer group

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
for instance  the company recognized a gain of  in and a loss of  in on the disposal of assets 
repairs and maintenance 
the company expenses repairs and maintenance as incurred 
every five years the company s vessels are required to go through regulatory drydocking 
the company elected  in a prior year  to account for its drydocking costs using the expense as incurred method as opposed to the defer and amortize method predominantly used by the company s industry peer group 
the company elected the expense as incurred method for accounting for these required regulatory drydocking costs as it is the method preferred by the securities and exchange commission 
see the tables on page for a discussion and analysis of the effect of using the expense as incurred method as compared with the defer and amortize method 
page impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations 
the company recognized no impairments in  or uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly provision based on specific known collectibility problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  and adjusts the provision account to the calculated balance 
it is our policy to write off receivables once it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the receipt of the receivable 
during the years ended december   and the company provided   and  respectively for uncollectible accounts 
the company records this expense in other operating expenses 
the trade receivable balances during the corresponding period were million  million and million for  and respectively 
the trade receivable balance increase in of million as well as the allowance account balance increase of  and  in and respectively was due to increased revenue in and income taxes

valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce the company s net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered such factors as cumulative earnings history in addition to projected results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event management was to determine that the company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination was made

the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it now requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods
