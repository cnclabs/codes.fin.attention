item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of refer to item business forward looking statements for a complete description of forward looking statements 
all of our businesses actively work together to deliver comprehensive mortgage and lending services to our correspondents  mortgage bankers and brokers  retail customers and capital market investors through a wide array of mortgage loan programs using web based technology and centralized operations so that we can provide high levels of customer service at low per loan operating costs 
we elect to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes  which generally allows us to pass through income to stockholders without payment of federal income tax at the corporate level 
our goal is to generate consistent and reliable income for distribution to our stockholders primarily from the earnings of our core operating businesses  which include the long term investment operations  mortgage operations  commercial operations  and warehouse lending operations

summary of financial and operating results net loss earnings of million for compared to million for estimated taxable income per diluted common share was for as compared to actual taxable income per diluted common share of for see the estimated taxable income available to imh common stockholders table for the calculation of estimated taxable income 
cash dividends paid during were per common share as compared to per common share for total assets as of december  were billion compared to billion as of december  book value per common share was as of december  as compared to as of prior year end 
the mortgage operations acquired or originated approximately billion of primarily non conforming alt a mortgages during  as compared to billion for the commercial operations originated approximately million of commercial and multifamily loans during  as compared to million acquired or originated by the reit in the long term investment operations retained approximately billion of primarily alt a mortgages and million commercial mortgages compared to billion and million  respectively  for restated consolidated financial statements for and certain amounts in the and consolidated statements of cash flows have been restated to properly reflect specific intercompany activities related to cash receipts from loan sales and cash disbursements for loan purchases between consolidated companies 
such intercompany loan sale and purchase transaction activities had the effect of presenting separate cash inflows and outflows even though there was no cash inflow or outflow on a consolidated basis 
this restatement serves to eliminate this intercompany activity from its consolidated statements of cash flows and present them as non cash transactions 
the correction of the error increases cash used in operating activities and increases cash provided by investing activities 
the restatement of these transactions does not change total cash and cash equivalents as reported for december  and furthermore  the restatement has no effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings  consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity 
in addition  certain amounts within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings have been restated to reflect the amortization of deferred charge for and as income tax expense benefit rather than non interest expense 
the amortization of deferred charge relates to income taxes on intercompany gains and this correction is believed to more appropriately reflect the overall income tax charges or benefits during and the restatement of this information does not change net earnings as reported for december  and furthermore  the restatement has no effect on the company s consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity or consolidated statements of cash flows as reported 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on our judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of our assets and liabilities at any given time 
in determining which accounting policies meet this definition  we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations 
we believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following allowance for loan losses  derivative financial instruments  securitization of financial assets as financing versus sale  calculation of repurchase reserve  and  amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs  allowance for loan losses we provide an allowance for loan losses for mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral  finance receivables and mortgages held for investment loans provided for 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management takes several items into consideration 
for instance  a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is created 
we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
management also recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring inherent loss in our loan portfolios 
these items include  but are not limited to  economic indicators that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  changes in value of collateral  projected loss curves  political factors and industry statistics 
specific valuation allowances may be established for loans that are deemed impaired  if default by the borrower is deemed probable  and if the fair value of the loan or the collateral is estimated to be less than the gross carrying value of the loan 
actual losses on loans are recorded as a reduction to the allowance through charge offs 
derivative financial instruments rate lock and purchase commitments we enter into commitments to make loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding rate lock commitments 
we also enter into commitments to purchase mortgage loans through our correspondent channel purchase commitments 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives 
in addition  purchase commitments for mortgage loans that are intended to be sold and those that will be held for investment purposes can qualify as derivatives 
both types of commitments to purchase loans are evaluated under the definition of a derivative to determine whether sfas is applicable 
rate lock and purchase commitments together loan commitments that are considered to be derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in change in fair value of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations 
unlike most other derivative instruments  there is no active market for the loan commitments that can be used to determine their fair value 
consequently  the company has developed a method for estimating the fair value of the company s loan commitments that are considered to be derivatives 
the fair value of the loan commitments are determined by calculating the change in market value from the point of commitment date to the measurement date based upon changes in interest rates during the period  and adjusted for an anticipated fallout factor for loan commitments that are not expected to fund 
under this fair value methodology  the loan commitment has zero value on day one and all future value is the result of changes in interest rates  exclusive of any inherent servicing value 
subsequent to the april  issuance of staff accounting bulletin no 
application of accounting principles to loan commitments  sab  when measuring the fair value of interest rate lock commitments  the amount of the expected servicing rights is not included in the valuation 
forward sale commitments the policy of recognizing the fair value of the rate lock commitments has the effect of recognizing a gain or loss on the related mortgage loans based on changes in the interest rate environment before the mortgage loans are funded and sold 
as such  rate lock commitments expose us to interest rate risk 
we mitigate such risk by entering into forward sale commitments  such as mandatory commitments on us treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities  call options  put options  and whole loan sale commitments 
these forward sale commitments are treated as derivatives under sfas no 
with the change in fair value of the derivative instruments reported as such in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the company s forward sale commitments are generally based on market prices provided by dealers  which make markets in these financial instruments 
interest rate swaps  caps  and floors the company s primary objective is to limit the exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to the variability of one month libor  which is the underlying index of adjustable rate securitized mortgage and short term borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements 
the company also monitors on an ongoing basis the prepayment risks that arise in fluctuating interest rate environments 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are formulated with the intent to offset the potential adverse effects of changing interest rates on securitized mortgage and reverse repurchase borrowings 
to mitigate exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on cash flows on securitized mortgage and reverse repurchase borrowings  the company purchases derivative instruments primarily in the form of interest rate swap agreements swaps and  to a lesser extent  interest rate cap agreements caps and interest rate floor agreements floors 
the swaps  caps and floors are treated as derivatives under the provisions of sfas  with changes in fair value of derivative instruments reported as such in the consolidated statements of operations 
cash paid or received on swaps  caps and floors is recorded as a current period expense or income as realized gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other derivative transactions are generally based on market prices provided by dealers  which make markets in these financial instruments 
securitization of financial assets as financing versus sale securitizations that are structured as sales provide a onetime contribution to our income or a gain on sale when the mortgage loans are sold to third parties using a securitization trust 
we refer to these transactions as un consolidated securitizations 
we determine the gain on sale by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between loans sold and the interests retained  based on relative fair values 
the gain recognized is the difference between the net proceeds of the securitization and the allocated carrying value of the loans sold 
net proceeds consist of cash and any other assets obtained  less any liabilities incurred 
our estimate of the fair value of our net retained interests in these securitizations requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of future cash flows from the retained interests 
we are exposed to credit risk from the underlying mortgage loans in un consolidated securitizations to the extent we retain subordinated interests 
changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in expected net credit losses will impact the value of our subordinated retained interests and those changes are recorded as a component of investment gain or loss 
in contrast  for securitizations that are structured as financings  we recognize interest income over the life of the mortgage loans held for investment and interest expense incurred for the borrowings 
we refer to these transactions as consolidated securitizations 
the mortgage loans collateralizing the debt securities for these financings are included in mortgage loans held for investment and the debt securities payable to investors in these securitizations are included in collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts on our balance sheet 
our recorded liability to repay these borrowings will be reduced to the extent cash flows received from the securitized and pledged assets are less than the recorded liabilities due 
we provide for credit losses for the mortgage loans held for investment as they are incurred by establishing or increasing an allowance for loan loss 
whether a securitization is consolidated or un consolidated  investors in the securities issued by the securitization trust have no recourse to our assets or to us and have no ability to require us to repurchase their securities  but rather have recourse only to the assets transferred to the trust 
whereas the accounting differences are significant  the underlying economic impact to us  over time  will be the same whether the securitization is structured consolidated or un consolidated 
the mortgage operations recognize gains or losses on the sale of mortgages when the sales transaction settles or upon the securitization of the mortgages when the risks of ownership have passed to the purchasing party 
gains and losses may be increased or decreased by the amount of any servicing related premiums received and costs associated with the acquisition or origination of mortgages 
a transfer of financial assets in which control is surrendered is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than a beneficial interest in the transferred assets is received in the exchange 
the long term investment operations structure securitized mortgage securitizations as financing arrangements and recognize no gain or loss on the transfer of mortgage assets 
the securitized mortgage securitization trusts do not meet criteria within sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  to be qualifying special purpose entities  and further  are considered variable interest entities under fasb interpretation no 
r fin r and  therefore  are consolidated by the long term investment operations as the entities primary beneficiary 
the mortgage operations generally structure remic securitizations as sales and gains and losses are recognized 
remics which do not meet the sale criteria within sfas are accounted for as secured borrowing transactions and consolidated under finr to the extent the company holds a residual interest and thus considered the primary beneficiary 
liabilities and derivatives incurred or obtained at the transfer of financial assets are required to be measured at fair value  if practicable 
also  servicing assets and other retained interests in the transferred assets must be measured by allocating the previous carrying value between the asset sold and the interest retained  if any  based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
to determine the value of the securities and retained interest  management uses certain analytics and data to estimate future rates of prepayments  prepayment penalties to be received  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity and their impact on estimated cash flows 
calculation of repurchase reserve when we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its origination 
investors have requested the company to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations or warranties 
upon completion of its own investigation regarding the investor claims  the company generally repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans  as appropriate 
the company maintains a liability for expected losses on dispositions of loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this repurchase liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests  actual loss experience  and other relevant factors including economic conditions 
the company calculates the repurchase reserve based on the trailing whole loan sales that still have outstanding standard representations and warranties 
the company applies a historical loss rate to these loans to derive the repurchase reserve 
the reserve includes the company s estimate of losses in the fair value of loans the company expects it will repurchase 
the loss in fair value is predominately determined based on historical locom losses on repurchased loans 
during all of the company s locom losses which totaled million were primarily related to the change in fair value of repurchased loans 
the company s repurchase reserve has increased from the prior year as a result of an increase in the expected loss rate due to increases in foreclosures 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in the whole loan sales volume which decreased to billion during compared to billion during amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases sfas  we amortize the mortgage premiums  securitization costs  bond discounts  and deferred gains losses to interest income over the estimated lives of the mortgages as an adjustment to yield of the mortgages 
amortization calculations include certain loan information including the interest rate  loan maturity  principal balance and certain assumptions including expected prepayment rates 
we estimate prepayments on a collateral specific basis and consider actual prepayment activity for the collateral pool 
we also consider the current interest rate environment and the forward market curve projections 
taxable income estimated taxable income available to common stockholders was million  or per diluted common share  for as compared to million  or for and million  or for to maintain our reit status  we are required to distribute a minimum of percent of our annual taxable income to our stockholders 
because we pay dividends based on taxable income  dividends may be more or less than net earnings loss 
as such  we believe that the disclosure of estimated taxable income available to common stockholders  which is a non generally accepted accounting principle  or gaap  financial measurement  is useful information for our investors 
we paid total cash dividends of per common share during  during and during  which  when combined with available tax loss carry forwards met taxable income distribution requirements for each year 
distributions to stockholders will generally be taxable as ordinary or qualified dividends  although such distributions may be designated as capital gains or a tax free return of capital 
under the jobs and growth tax relief act of  a portion of the total common stock cash dividends paid to our stockholders during and were the result of dividends paid from ifc to imh which will be taxed as qualifying dividends 
imh annually furnishes to each of its stockholders a statement setting forth the tax characteristics of the dividends 
the dividend distribution characteristics are percent and percent as ordinary income and qualifying dividends  respectively 
upon the filing of our tax return  the reit had a federal net operating tax loss carry forward of million  which expires in the year and which may or may not be used to offset taxable income in or in subsequent years 
we expect to file our federal and state tax returns in september at which time changes to federal net operating loss carry forwards  if any  will be determined 
year ended vs 
year ended estimated taxable income available to imh common stockholders estimated taxable income available to imh common stockholders excludes net earnings from ifc and its subsidiaries and the elimination of intercompany loan sale transactions 
the following schedule reconciles net earnings to estimated taxable income available to common stockholders of the reit 
for the year ended december  net loss earnings    adjustments to net loss earnings loan loss provision    tax deduction for actual loan losses   gaap earnings on remics  taxable income on remics  change in fair value of derivatives   dividends on preferred stock    net loss earnings of taxable reit subsidiaries  dividend from taxable reit subsidiaries   elimination of inter company loan sales transactions  net miscellaneous adjustments estimated taxable income available to common stockholders estimated taxable income per diluted common share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding  estimated taxable income includes estimates of book to tax adjustments which can differ from actual taxable income as calculated when we file our annual corporate tax return 
since estimated taxable income is a non gaap financial measurement  the reconciliation of estimated taxable income available to common stockholders to net loss earnings is intended to meet the requirements of regulation g as promulgated by the sec for the presentation of non gaap financial measurements 
to maintain our reit status  we are required to distribute a minimum of percent of our annual taxable income to our stockholders 
certain adjustments are made to net loss earnings in order to calculate taxable income due to differences in the way revenues and expenses are recognized under the two methods 
to calculate estimated taxable income  actual loan losses are deducted 
for the calculation of net earnings  gaap requires a deduction for estimated losses inherent in our mortgage portfolios in the form of a provision for loan losses  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
therefore  as the estimated losses provided for under gaap are actually realized  the losses will negatively and may materially effect future taxable income 
includes gaap to tax differences related to the isac remic  isac remic  isac remic  isac remic  and isac remic securitizations  which were treated as secured borrowings for gaap purposes and sales for tax purposes 
the remic gaap income excludes the provision for loan losses recorded that may relate to the remic collateral included in securitized mortgage collateral 
the company does not have any specific valuation allowances recorded as an offset to the remic collateral 
the mark to market change for the valuation of derivatives at imh is income or expense for gaap financial reporting purposes but is not included as an addition or deduction for taxable income calculations until realized 
represents net loss earnings of ifc and iccc  our taxable reit subsidiaries trs  which may not necessarily equal taxable income 
starting january   the company elected to convert iccc from a qualified reit subsidiary to a trs 
any dividends paid to imh by the trs in excess of their cumulative undistributed earnings and profits taxable income minus taxes paid would be recognized as a return of capital by imh to the extent of imh s capital investment in the trs 
distributions from the trs to imh may not equal the trs net earnings  however  imh can only recognize dividend distributions received from the trs as taxable income to the extent that the trs distributions are from current or prior period undistributed earnings and profits taxable income minus taxes paid 
any distributions by the trs in excess of imh s capital investment in the trs would be taxed as capital gains 
includes the effects to taxable income associated with the elimination of gains from inter company loan sales and other inter company transactions between ifc  iccc  and imh  net of tax and the related amortization of the deferred charge 
excludes the deduction for common stock cash dividends paid and the availability of a deduction attributable to net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   the company has estimated federal net operating loss carry forwards of million that are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration in the year estimated taxable income available to common shareholders decreased million for the year ended as compared to decreases of million for the decline in estimated taxable income was mainly attributable to a decline of million in adjusted net interest income at imh  which includes the realized gain loss from derivative instruments and excludes amortization of intercompany loan discounts  a decrease in the dividend from the taxable reit subsidiaries of million  as a result of a decrease in the gains from loan sales  an increase in loan losses of million  as a result of an increase in delinquencies  a decrease in fees and other income generated from the warehouse operations of million  partially offset by  a million of taxable income generated from the investment in our remic securitizations in excess of gaap earnings on the remics 
the decline in adjusted net interest income at imh of million was primarily the result of a decline in the interest spread on securitized mortgage collateral which resulted from interest rates rising on the borrowings at a faster rate than the adjustable rate mortgages could increase  coupled with a hedge ratio that was less than of the mortgage portfolio

credit risk 
we manage credit risk by retaining high credit quality alt a mortgages and commercial mortgages from our customers  adequately providing for loan losses and actively managing delinquencies and defaults 
we believe that by improving the overall credit quality of our long term mortgage portfolio we can consistently generate stable future cash flow and net earnings 
during we retained primarily alt a mortgages with an original weighted average credit score of and an original weighted average ltv ratio of percent 
alt a mortgages are primarily first lien mortgages made to borrowers whose credit is generally within typical fannie mae and freddie mac guidelines  but that have loan characteristics that make them non conforming under those guidelines 
we primarily acquire non conforming a or a credit quality mortgages  collectively  alt a mortgages 
as of december   the original weighted average credit score of mortgages held as residential and commercial securitized mortgage collateral was and and original weighted average ltv ratio of and percent  respectively 
for additional information regarding the long term mortgage portfolio refer to item long term mortgage portfolio  note c securitized mortgage collateral and note d mortgages held for investment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have adequately provided for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million as of december  as compared to million as of prior year end 
actual loan charge offs net of recoveries on mortgages in the mortgage portfolio and finance receivables increased to million for as compared to million for included in the allowance at december  was a specific reserve of million for expected losses from hurricane affected areas 
additionally  the company maintains a specific reserve of million for specific warehouse lines that we deem impaired 
also included in the allowance is a million specific reserve for loans that were repurchased during that were held as securitized mortgage collateral in the mortgage operations 
we monitor our subservicers to make sure that they perform loss mitigation  foreclosure and collection functions according to our servicing guide 
this includes an effective and aggressive collection effort in order to minimize the number of mortgages which become seriously delinquent 
when resolving delinquent mortgages  sub servicers are required to take timely and aggressive action 
the sub servicer is required to determine payment collection under various circumstances  which will result in maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the mortgage current or by foreclosing and liquidating the property 
we perform ongoing review of mortgages that display weaknesses and believe that we maintain an adequate loss allowance on our mortgages 
when a borrower fails to make required payments on a mortgage and does not cure the delinquency within days  we generally record a notice of default and commence foreclosure proceedings 
if the mortgage is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  the property may then be sold at a foreclosure sale 
at foreclosure sales  we generally acquire title to the property 
as of december   our long term mortgage portfolio included percent of mortgages that were days or more delinquent as compared to percent as of year end and percent as of december  the following table summarizes mortgages that we own  including securitized mortgage collateral  mortgages held for investment and mortgages held for sale  that were or more days delinquent for the periods indicated in thousands as of december  loans held for sale days delinquent    or more days delinquent    foreclosures    delinquent bankruptcies  total days delinquent loans held for sale   long term mortgage portfolio days delinquent    or more days delinquent    foreclosures    delinquent bankruptcies    total days delinquent long term mortgage portfolio total or more days delinquent   non performing assets consist of mortgages that are days or more delinquent  including loans in foreclosure and delinquent bankruptcies 
it is our policy to place a mortgage on non accrual status when it becomes days delinquent and to reverse from revenue any accrued interest 
when real estate is acquired in settlement of loans  or other real estate owned  the mortgage is written down to a percentage of the property s appraised value or broker s price opinion less anticipated selling costs and including mortgage insurance expected to be received 
as of december   non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was percent compared to percent as of year end and percent as of year end the following table summarizes mortgages that we own  including securitized mortgage collateral  mortgages held for investment and mortgages held for sale  that were non performing for the periods indicated in thousands as of december  or more days delinquent  foreclosures and delinquent bankruptcies other real estate owned    total non performing assets    a percentage of real estate owned  which consists of residential real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less estimated selling and holding costs 
adjustments to the loan carrying value required at the time of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
losses or gains from the ultimate disposition of real estate owned are recorded as gain loss on sale of other real estate owned in the consolidated statement of operations 
real estate owned at december  was million percent higher than  as a result of a seasoning portfolio  slowing prepayments and an increase in non performing loans 
we have realized a loss on disposition of real estate owned in the amount of million for the year ended december   as compared to a realized gain on disposition of real estate owned in the amount of million for the year ended december  at december  beginning balance   foreclosures   liquidations   ending balance   in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed  including the delinquency rates 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  and vintage 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is calculated 
we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
management also recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring inherent loss in our loan portfolios 
these items include  but are not limited to  economic indicators that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  changes in value of collateral  political factors and industry statistics 
while our delinquency rates have increased they have not increased at a rate in excess of our expectations 
we believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our mortgage portfolio as of december  prepayment risk 
the company uses prepayment penalties as a method of partially mitigating prepayment risk 
mortgage industry evidence suggests that the increase in home appreciation rates and lower payment option mortgage products over the last three years has been a significant factor affecting borrowers refinancing decisions 
as rates increase  borrowers will find it more difficult to refinance to a lower rate at the reset dates 
if borrowers are unable to pay their mortgage payments at the adjusted rate  delinquencies may increase 
the three month constant prepayment rate cpr decreased to percent at december  from percent as of december   which is primarily related to interest rates rising faster on fixed rate mortgage loans quicker than our arms adjusted upward 
during  percent of alt a mortgages retained by the long term investment operations from the mortgage operations had prepayment penalty features ranging from six months to five years  and as of december   percent of residential securitized mortgages retained had prepayment penalties 
as of december   the twelve month cpr of mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral for residential and commercial loans was and percent as compared to and percent as of december  and and percent twelve month cpr as of december  prepayment penalties are charged to borrowers for mortgages that are repaid early and recorded as interest income on our consolidated financial statements 
interest income from prepayment penalties helps offset additional amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs 
during  prepayment penalties received from borrowers were recorded as interest income and increased the yield on average mortgage assets by basis points as compared to basis points for liquidity risk 
we employ a leverage strategy to increase assets by financing our long term mortgage portfolio primarily with securitized mortgage borrowings  reverse repurchase agreements and capital  then using cash proceeds to acquire additional mortgage assets 
we retain arms and frms that are acquired and originated from the mortgage and commercial operations and finance the acquisition of those mortgages  during this accumulation period  with reverse repurchase agreements 
after accumulating a pool of mortgages  generally between million and billion  we sell the mortgages in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations  whole loan sales or remics 
remics may be on balance sheet or off balance sheet 
under either accounting methods  our cash invested on the date of securitization is generally between percent and percent of the borrowings 
our strategy is to sell or securitize our mortgages within days in order to reduce the accumulation period that mortgages are outstanding on short term reverse repurchase facilities  which reduces our exposure to margin calls and reduces spread risk on these facilities 
securitized mortgage borrowings are classes of bonds that are sold to investors of mortgage backed securities and as such are not subject to margin calls 
in addition  the securitized mortgage borrowings generally require a smaller initial cash investment as a percentage of mortgages financed than does interim reverse repurchase financing 
additionally  as interest rates decline our requirement to maintain certain cash collateral balances increases  which reduces our cash and cash equivalents available for use in operations 
as of december  our cash collateral balance totaled million  as compared to million as of december  because of the historically favorable loss rates of our alt a mortgages  we have received favorable credit ratings on our securitized mortgage borrowings from credit rating agencies  which has increased the percentage of bonds issued and reduced our required initial capital investment 
the ratio of total assets to total equity  or leverage ratio  was to as of december  as compared to to as of december this use of leverage at these historical levels allows us to grow our balance sheet by efficiently using available capital 
we continually monitor our leverage ratio and liquidity levels to insure that we are adequately protected against adverse changes in market conditions

net interest spread on mortgage assets is calculated by subtracting the weighted average yield on total borrowings on mortgage assets from the weighted average yield on total mortgage assets 
net interest margin on mortgage assets is calculated by subtracting interest expense on total borrowings on mortgage assets from interest income on total mortgage assets and then dividing by total average mortgage assets and annualized for the quarter margin 
yield represents income from the accretion of loan discounts  included in above  divided by total average mortgage assets 
yield represents net cash payments receipts on derivatives divided by total average mortgage assets 
adjusted net interest margin on mortgage assets is calculated by subtracting interest expense on total borrowings on mortgage assets  accretion of loan discounts and net cash receipts on derivatives from interest income on total mortgage assets divided by total average mortgage assets 
net cash receipts on derivatives are a component of realized gain on derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted net interest margin on mortgage assets is a non gaap financial measurement  however  the reconciliation provided in this table is intended to meet the requirements of regulation g as promulgated by the sec for the presentation of non gaap financial measurements 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted net interest margin on mortgage assets is a useful operating performance measure for our investors as it more closely reflects the economics of net interest margins on mortgage assets by providing information to evaluate net interest income attributable to net investments 
the amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs are components of interest income and interest expense  respectively 
yield represents the cost of amortization of net loan premiums and securitization costs divided by total average mortgage assets 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreases in net interest income were primarily due to a decline in net interest margins on mortgage assets primarily caused by the following increase in one month libor rate underlying borrowings only partially offset by realized gain loss from derivative instruments  differences in interest rate adjustment periods  mortgage loans and mortgage borrowings  prepayments of higher yielding mortgages  and  a more challenging competitive environment 
net interest income for was million percent lower than the year over year decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the change in the one month libor  which is the interest rate index used to price borrowing costs on securitized mortgage and reverse repurchase borrowings  which rose approximately basis points since while mortgage assets over the same period did not re price upward as quickly 
this resulted in interest expense increasing by million percent in as compared to additionally total average mortgage assets declined by billion percent for as compared to adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets  as defined in the yield table above  declined by basis points percent during as compared to the decrease in adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets was primarily due to a negative variance of basis points in borrowing costs partially offset by a favorable variance of basis points on realized gains from derivative assets and a favorable variance of basis points on mortgage assets as coupons have adjusted 
during  the federal reserve raised short term interest rates basis points  which effected movements in one month libor  a total of basis points 
this caused borrowing costs on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings  which are tied to one month libor and re price monthly without limitation  to increase at a faster pace than coupons on libor arms securing securitized mortgage borrowings  which generally re price every six months with limitation 
libor arms held in our long term investment portfolio are subject to the following interest rate risks interest rate adjustment limitations on mortgages held for investment due to periodic and lifetime interest rate cap features as compared to borrowings which are not subject to adjustment limitations  mismatched interest rate re pricing periods between mortgages held for investment  which generally re price every six months  and borrowings  which re price every month in regards to securitized mortgage borrowings and daily in regards to reverse repurchase agreements  and uneven and unequal movements in the interest rate indices used to re price mortgages held for investment  which are generally indexed to one  three and six month libor and one year libor  and borrowings  which are generally indexed to one month libor 
mortgage prepayment speeds mitigated during the three month constant prepayment rate cpr decreased to percent at december  from percent as of december   which is related to rates rising in the marketplace at a faster rate than the rates on our adjustable mortgage loans 
amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs decreased by basis points percent during as compared to the decrease was a result of a lower prepayment rate than in the prior year 
a substantial portion of our long term mortgage investment portfolio consists of mortgages with prepayment penalty features that are primarily designed to help minimize the rate of early mortgage prepayments 
however  if borrowers do prepay on mortgages  a prepayment penalty is charged which helps partially offset additional amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs related to the prepaid mortgages 
during  prepayment penalties received from borrowers was recorded as interest income and increased adjusted net interest margin by basis points percent of mortgage assets as compared to additionally  the net interest margin continues to be affected by the difficult competitive environment facing mortgage portfolio lenders 
as a result  net interest margins continue to tighten on newly originated loans 
furthermore  a rise in short term rates and a decline in long term rates have resulted in a partial inversion of the yield curve  adding pressure to mortgage lending profitability 
during  adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets  which is a non gaap financial measurement as indicated in the yield table above  declined by basis points percent as compared to adjusted net interest margin on mortgage assets did not decline as much as net interest margin on mortgage assets primarily due to a basis point increase in realized gain loss from derivative instruments relative to total average mortgage assets 
benefits received from derivatives relative to total average mortgage assets partially offset the decline in the net interest margin on mortgage assets which was caused by the factors described above 
our interest rate risk management policies are formulated with the intent to offset the potential adverse effects of changing interest rates primarily associated with cash flows on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings 
however  as a result of the combination of the factors listed above  the interest rate spread differential between arms and adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings compressed  which decreased net interest margins on mortgage assets 
by design  our current interest rate risk management program provides percent to percent coverage of the outstanding principal balance of our six month libor arms and percent to percent coverage of the outstanding principal balance of intermediate  or hybrid  arms at the point in time that we securitize the mortgages 
income taxes 
income tax benefit decreased to million during as compared to million during primarily due to an increase in operating losses at ifc and iccc 
ifc and iccc are taxable reit subsidiaries trs and are therefore subject to corporate income taxes 
for gaap purposes  the company records a deferred charge to eliminate the expense recognition of income taxes paid on inter company profits that result from the sale of mortgages from ifc and iccc to the long term investment operations 
included in the income tax expense is the amortization of the deferred charge 
a deferred charge was recorded to eliminate the income tax effect resulting from gains on inter company mortgage sales from the mortgage and commercial operations taxable reit subsidiaries to the reit 
the deferred charge is amortized to expense over the expected life of the mortgages 
amortization of deferred charge was million during as compared to million during the year over year decrease in the amortization of the deferred charge was the result of a lower average balance of deferred charge in as compared as a result of billion percent decrease in retention of mortgages by the long term investment operations from the mortgage and commercial operations in for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreases in net interest income were primarily due to a decline in net interest margins on mortgage assets primarily caused by the following increase in one month libor rate underlying borrowings only partially offset by realized gain loss from derivative instruments  differences in interest rate adjustment periods  faster amortization of mortgage premium and securitized mortgage securitization cost  use of higher leverage lower net interest margin securitized mortgages completed during since the second half of  and an increasingly challenging competitive environment 
net interest income for decreased percent to million as compared to million for the year over year decrease in net interest income of million was primarily due to net interest margins on mortgage assets declining by basis points to percent for as compared to percent for net interest margin on mortgage assets declined as one month libor  which is the interest rate index used to price borrowing costs on securitized mortgage and reverse repurchase borrowings  rose approximately basis points since while mortgage assets over the same period did not re price upward as quickly 
this resulted in an increase in interest expense of percent to billion in compared to million in adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets  as defined in the yield table above  declined by basis points to percent during as compared to percent during the decrease in adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets was primarily due to an increase in short term interest rates  an increase in the amortization of loan premiums  securitization costs and bond discounts as a result of higher than expected mortgage prepayments and  to a lesser extent  higher leverage and lower net interest margins on certain securitized mortgages completed during the second half of during  the federal reserve raised short term interest rates  which effected movements in one month libor  a total of basis points 
this caused borrowing costs on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings  which are tied to one month libor and re price monthly without limitation  to rise at a faster pace than coupons on libor arms securing securitized mortgage borrowings  which generally re price every six months with limitation 
libor arms held in our long term investment portfolio are subject to the following interest rate risks interest rate adjustment limitations on mortgages held for investment due to periodic and lifetime interest rate cap features as compared to borrowings which are not subject to adjustment limitations  mismatched interest rate re pricing periods between mortgages held for investment  which generally re price every six months  and borrowings  which re price every month in regards to securitized mortgage borrowings and daily in regards to reverse repurchase agreements  and uneven and unequal movements in the interest rate indices used to re price mortgages held for investment  which are generally indexed to one  three and six month libor and one year libor  and borrowings  which are generally indexed to one month libor 
along with an increase in short term interest rates  our expectation  based on past experience  was that we would see a corresponding decline in mortgage prepayment speeds 
however  mortgage prepayment speeds continued at heightened levels during there is recent mortgage industry evidence that documents a substantial increase in home appreciation rates over the last three years which has been a significant factor affecting prepayment patterns of alt a borrowers 
borrowers appear more willing to use home equity to pay loan prepayment penalties in order to obtain lower monthly payments by refinancing into other mortgage products  such as interest only and high loan to value mortgage products 
actual prepayment speeds in excess of projected future prepayment rates resulted in a cumulative upward adjustment in both the amortization rate and amortization amount of loan premiums  securitization costs and bond discounts during as such  amortization of loan premiums and securitization expenses increased by basis points to percent of average mortgage assets during as compared to percent of average mortgage assets during a substantial portion of our long term mortgage investment portfolio consists of mortgages with prepayment penalty features that are primarily designed to help minimize the rate of early mortgage prepayments 
however  if mortgages do prepay  a prepayment penalty is charged which helps offset additional amortization of loan premiums and securitization costs 
during  prepayment penalties received from borrowers was recorded as interest income and increased basis points to basis points of mortgage assets as compared to basis points of mortgage assets in because of the uncertainty surrounding our ability to raise capital in during the process of restating our consolidated financial statements  we utilized securitized mortgage structures during the second half of which allowed us to preserve existing capital through the use of higher leverage and lower net interest margins 
higher leverage securitized mortgages were structured to require a lower level of initial capital investment than for securitized mortgages completed prior to july capital invested in higher leverage securitized mortgages has been  and will continue to be  deposited into those specific securitized mortgage trusts from monthly excess cash flows on mortgages securing the securitized mortgages until the required level of capital investment is attained 
the use of higher leverage securitized mortgages contributed to compressed net interest margins on total mortgage assets 
additionally  the net interest margin continues to be impacted by the difficult competitive environment facing mortgage portfolio lenders 
as a result  net interest margins continue to tighten on newly originated loans 
furthermore  a rise in short term rates and decline in long term rates has resulted in a flattening of the yield curve  adding pressure to mortgage lending profitability 
during  adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets  which is a non gaap financial measurement as indicated in the yield table above  decreased by basis points as compared to a decline of basis points on net interest margin on mortgage assets 
adjusted net interest margin on mortgage assets did not decline as much as net interest margin on mortgage assets primarily due to a basis point increase in realized gain loss from derivative instruments relative to total average mortgage assets 
lower derivative costs relative to total average mortgage assets partially offset the decline in adjusted net interest margins on mortgage assets which was caused by the factors described above 
adjusted net interest margins were also affected by the following during our interest rate risk management policies do not allow percent coverage of the principal amount outstanding on securitized mortgage borrowings at any given time  and actual mortgage prepayments and the corresponding repayment of securitized mortgage borrowings exceeded the pre determined amortization schedule of the notional amount of derivative instruments 
our interest rate risk management policies are formulated with the intent to offset the potential adverse effects of changing interest rates primarily associated with cash flows on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings 
however  as a result of the combination of the factors listed above  the interest rate spread differential between arms and adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings compressed  which compressed net interest margins on mortgage assets 
by design  our current interest rate risk management program provides percent to percent coverage of the outstanding principal balance of our six month libor arms and percent to percent coverage of the outstanding principal balance of intermediate  or hybrid  arms at the point in time that we securitize the mortgages 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to a benefit million during as compared to an expense of million during primarily due to an increase in operating losses at ifc when profits on inter company loan sales are eliminated from ifc s net earnings 
ifc is a taxable reit subsidiary trs and is therefore subject to corporate income taxes 
for gaap purposes  the company records a deferred charge to eliminate the expense recognition of income taxes paid on inter company profits that result from the sale of mortgages from ifc to the long term operations 
the amortization of the deferred charge is recorded in other expense rather than income tax expense 
a deferred charge was recorded to eliminate the income tax effect resulting from gains on inter company mortgage sales  which primarily represent the amount allocated to msrs when they are sold to third parties 
the deferred charge is amortized to expense over the expected life of the mortgages 
amortization of deferred charge was million during as compared to million during the year over year increase in the amortization of the deferred charge was the result of a higher average balance of deferred charge in as compared as a result of billion in retentions of mortgages by the long term investment operations from the mortgage operations in also  the increase in amortization was associated with the higher loan prepayments in as compared to non interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes in non interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  increase decrease change realized gain from derivative instruments   change in fair value of derivative instruments   gain on sale of loans    provision for repurchases    loss on lower of cost or market writedown   amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  impairment on investment securities available for sale gain loss on sale of other real estate owned   other income    total non interest income    realized gain from derivative instruments 
realized gains from derivative instruments increased by million percent during as compared to the increase in realized gains from derivatives is due to the basis point increase in the one month libor from the end of  which has caused the floating rate payments received on swaps to increase above the fixed payments made 
realized gains from derivative instruments are recorded as current period expense or income on our consolidated financial statements and are included in the calculation of taxable income 
realized gains exclude the mark to market gains that are realized for tax purposes at the taxable reit subsidiaries when the loans held for sale are deposited into the securitization trust  and the related derivatives are deposited into a swap trust 
these gains are not realized for gaap purposes  as the deposit of the derivatives into the swap trust are considered an inter company transfer  as the reit consolidates the swap trust 
for gaap purpose  these gains and losses are included in change in fair value of derivative instruments 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
change in fair value of derivative instruments decreased to a loss of million during as compared to gains of million during the decrease in market valuation was the result of the net cash payments received on the derivatives  which are recorded as realized gains 
we primarily enter into derivative contracts to offset changes in cash flows associated with securitized mortgage liabilities 
in our consolidated financial statements  we record a market valuation adjustment for these derivatives  as well as other derivatives used by the mortgage and commercial operations to hedge our loan pipeline and mortgage loans held for sale  as current period expense or revenue 
changes in the fair value of derivatives at imh are not included as an addition or deduction for purposes of calculating estimated taxable income 
gain on sale of loans 
gain on sale of loans decreased million percent during as compared to the decrease was primarily due to an percent decrease in whole loan sales and un consolidated remic securitizations as the mortgage and commercial operations sold billion of loans to third party investors including an million un consolidated remic during as compared to billion and million  respectively for additionally  we use derivatives to protect the market value of mortgages from the point in time when we establish an interest rate lock commitment on a particular mortgage prior to its close until the eventual sale or securitization 
any changes in interest rates on mortgages that we have committed to acquire at a particular rate until we sell or securitize the mortgage generally results in an increase or decrease in the market value of the related derivative 
for the year ended december   we recorded an million loss from the settlement of these derivatives as compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  provision for repurchases 
provision for repurchases increased million percent during as compared to the increase in the provision for repurchases was primarily due to an increase in outstanding loan repurchase requests to million at the end of compared to million at december  loss on lower of cost or market writedown 
the loss on lower of cost or market locom writedown increased million percent  primarily due to an million writedown on loans held for sale that were repurchased in the second quarter due to higher early payment defaults on whole loan sales

realized gain loss from derivative instruments increased to million during as compared to million during  or basis points of total average mortgage assets during as compared to basis points of total average mortgage assets during the increase in realized gain loss from derivatives is due to the basis point increase in one month libor from the end of  which has caused the floating rate payment received on swaps to increase above the fixed payment made 
realized gain loss from derivative instruments are recorded as current period expense or revenue on our consolidated financial statements and are included in the calculation of taxable income 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
change in fair value of derivative instruments increased to million during as compared to million during the increase in market valuation adjustment was the result of an increase in future expectations of short term interest rates which took place during as a result of stronger than expected employment growth and rising inflationary expectations 
we primarily enter into derivative contracts to offset changes in cash flows associated with securitized mortgage liabilities 
in our consolidated financial statements  we record a market valuation adjustment for these derivatives  as well as other derivatives used by the mortgage operations to hedge our loan pipeline and mortgage loans held for sale  as current period expense or revenue 
changes in fair value of derivatives at imh are not included as an addition or deduction for purposes of calculating estimated taxable income 
gain on sale of loans 
gain on sale of loans increased to million during as compared to million during the increase of million is primarily due to a percent increase in whole loan sales and a remic securitization as the mortgage operations sold billion of loans to third party investors and a remic during as compared to billion for the same period in additionally  we use derivatives to protect the market value of mortgages from the point in time when we establish an interest rate lock commitment on a particular mortgage prior to its close until the eventual sale or securitization 
any changes in interest rates on mortgages that we have committed to acquire at a particular rate until we sell or securitize the mortgage generally results in an increase or decrease in the market value of the related derivative 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million gain from the settlement of these derivatives as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  provision for repurchases 
provision for repurchases increased million percent during as compared to the increase in the provision for repurchases was primarily due to an increase in outstanding loan repurchase requests at december  loss on lower of cost or market writedown 
gaap requires us to record our loans held for sale at the lower of cost or market locom value 
market conditions at the end of  such as widening of credit and bond spreads and an oversupply of mortgage inventory  resulted in the loans decreasing in value below cost are at end of resulting in us recording a million locom adjustment

although the mortgage operations acquisitions and originations remained substantially unchanged at billion for as compared to billion in  we continued to hire personnel to support the current levels of production 
operating costs also increased during due to the expansion of our wholesale mortgage operations into the midwest and east coast including the hiring of mortgage professionals and the assumption of certain premises and operating leases 
in addition  an increase in staffing caused an increase of million  or percent  in general and administrative and other expense while occupancy expense increased to million  or percent  during as compared to million during in order to accommodate expansion  we entered into premises leases for office space directly surrounding our main corporate facility in newport beach  california 
the expansion of our operations within a geographically centralized area allows us to maintain our centralized operating approach 
results of operations by business segment we operate four core businesses the long term investment operations  the mortgage operations  the commercial operations  and the warehouse lending operations

net interest income decreased million percent primarily due to a percent increase in borrowing cost on securitized mortgage borrowings as the one month libor increased approximately basis points in the long term investment operations acquired billion of mortgages from the mortgage and commercial operations 
the acquisition of mortgages by the long term investment operations was primarily financed by the securitization of billion of securitized mortgages 
the adjusted net interest margin on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral remained relatively flat at percent during from percent during adjusted net interest margin on mortgages held in the long term mortgage portfolio is calculated by subtracting interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings  accretion of loan discounts related to the long term investment operations from interest income including realized gains from derivatives on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral  and loans held for investment million and dividing by the average mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral and loans held for investment million in the yield table above 
non interest income 
non interest income for the long term investment operations is primarily derived from realized gains from derivative instruments and change in fair value of derivative instruments 
during  non interest income decreased million percent primarily due to increases of million in realized gains from derivative instruments offset by a decrease of million in change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the change in the fair value of the derivatives is the result of the cash receipts received on the derivatives realized gains on derivatives compounded by short term borrowing rates rising faster than fixed rate mortgage loans 
on january   we elected to change imcc from a qualified reit subsidiary to a taxable reit subsidiary which is consistent with the remaining mortgage operations

the acquisition and origination of mortgages by the long term investment operations was primarily financed by the securitization of billion of securitized mortgages 
the adjusted net interest margin on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral declined basis points to percent during as compared to percent during the decline in adjusted net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in short term interest rates  an increase in the amortization of loan premiums  securitization costs and bond discounts as a result of higher than expected mortgage prepayments and  to a lesser extent  higher leverage and lower net interest margins on certain securitized mortgages completed during the second half of  as previously discussed 
adjusted net interest margin on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral is calculated by subtracting interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings  accretion of loan discounts and cost of derivatives from interest income on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral and dividing by average mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral in the yield table above 
non interest income 
non interest income for our long term investment operations is primarily derived from realized gain loss from derivative instruments  change in fair value of derivative instruments  gain loss on loans held for sale  gain loss on sale of securities  loan servicing income and other fee income 
during  non interest income rose by million to million as compared to million during primarily due to increases of million in realized gain loss from derivative instruments and million in change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the increase in realized gain loss from derivative instruments is primarily associated with the increase in one month libor and the change in fair value of derivative instruments is primarily attributable to an increase in future expectations of higher one month libor rates positively affecting the value of derivatives

net earnings for the mortgage operations decreased million percent primarily due to the following changes decrease of million in net interest income expense  decrease of million in gains from the sale of loans  increase in charges to expense of million for the write down of loans held for sale  decrease in non interest expenses of million  offset by increase in other income of million 
net interest income dropped percent during as the yields on borrowings for mortgage loans held for sale increased basis points during  primarily the result of a basis point increase in the one month libor during gains from the sale of loans decreased percent as a result of lower volumes of mortgages sold to the long term investment operations and third party investors resulted in a decrease in gain loss on sale of loans 
the mortgage operations sold billion to the long term investment operations and third party investors in  percent less than the billion sold in gain loss on sale of loans includes the difference between the price at which we acquire or originate mortgages and the price we receive upon the sale or securitization of mortgages plus or minus direct mortgage origination revenue and costs  eg loan and underwriting fees  commissions  appraisal review fees and document processing expenses 
gain on sale of loans acquired or originated by the mortgage operations also includes a premium for the sale of mortgage servicing rights upon the sale or securitization of mortgages 
in order to minimize risks associated with the accumulation of mortgages  we seek to securitize or sell mortgages monthly thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and price volatility during the accumulation period of mortgages 
additionally  as required by gaap  the company recorded loans held for sale at the lower of cost or market resulting in a million write down as current market conditions  such as the widening of credit and bond spreads and a lack of demand for mortgage product forced the loans to drop in value prior to securitization  sale or transfer 
the million write down was primarily attributable to loans repurchased during the second and fourth quarter of fiscal the mortgage operations are reflected as a stand alone entity for segment financial reporting purposes  however  on the consolidated financial statements inter company loan sales and related gains are eliminated 
other income increased million as the company earned more fees in the current year from loan servicing fees and interest income on custody accounts 
additionally this change includes a million increase as a result of a favorable mark to market adjustment on the derivatives at the mortgage operations

net earnings for the mortgage operations were million during as compared to million during the decrease in net earnings was primarily due to decreases of million in net interest income and million in non interest income  offset by an increase in non interest expense and income taxes of million 
net interest income dropped percent during to million as compared to million for although interest income on mortgage assets increased percent to million as compared to million for  borrowing costs  which are tied to one month libor  increased approximately basis points which caused borrowing costs to increase faster than the adjustments on our assets and resulted in an overall decrease in net interest income 
non interest income decreased percent during primarily due to a million decrease in gain loss on sale of loans 
lower volumes of mortgages sold to the long term investment operations and third party investors resulted in a decrease in gain loss on sale of loans 
the mortgage operations sold billion to the long term investment operations and third party investors in  percent less than the billion sold in gain loss on sale of loans includes the difference between the price at which we acquire or originate mortgages and the price we receive upon the sale or securitization of mortgages plus or minus direct mortgage origination revenue and costs  ie loan and underwriting fees  commissions  appraisal review fees and document processing expenses 
gain on sale of loans acquired or originated by the mortgage operations also includes a premium for the sale of mortgage servicing rights upon the sale or securitization of mortgages including remics and securitized mortgages

liquidity and capital resources we recognize the need to have funds available for our operating businesses and our customers demands for obtaining short term warehouse financing until the settlement or sale of mortgages with us or with other investors 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times to cover normal cyclical swings in funding availability and mortgage demand and to allow us to meet abnormal and unexpected funding requirements 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
toward this goal  our asset liability committee  or alco  is responsible for monitoring our liquidity position and funding needs 
alco participants include senior executives of the mortgage operations  commercial operations and warehouse lending operations 
alco meets on a weekly basis to review current and projected sources and uses of funds 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet for changes in the liquidity of our assets 
our primary liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term securities available for sale and maturing mortgages  or liquid assets 
we believe that current cash balances  short term investments  currently available financing facilities  capital raising capabilities and excess cash flows generated from our long term mortgage portfolio will adequately provide for projected funding needs and limited asset growth 
refer to item a business risk factors for additional information regarding risks that could adversely affect our liquidity 
our operating businesses primarily use available funds as follows acquisition and origination of mortgages by the mortgage and commercial operations  long term investment in mortgages by the long term investment operations  provide short term warehouse advances by the warehouse lending operations  pay interest on debt  distribute common and preferred stock dividends  and pay operating and non operating expenses 
acquisition and origination of mortgages by the mortgage and long term investment operations 
during  the mortgage and commercial operations originated or acquired billion of primarily alt a mortgages  of which billion were retained by the long term investment operations from the mortgage and commercial operations for long term investment 
capital invested in mortgages is outstanding until we sell or securitize mortgages  which is one of the reasons we attempt to sell or securitize mortgages within days of acquisition or origination 
initial capital invested in mortgages includes premiums paid when mortgages are acquired and originated and our capital investment  or haircut  required upon financing  which is generally determined by the type of collateral provided 
the mortgage operations acquired and originated billion of residential mortgages at a weighted average price of  which were financed with warehouse borrowings from the warehouse lending operations at a haircut generally between percent to percent of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgages 
in addition  iccc originated million of commercial mortgages at a weighted average price of which were initially financed with short term reverse repurchase financing from the warehouse lending operations at a haircut of generally percent of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgages 
long term investment in mortgages by the long term investment operations 
the long term investment operations acquire primarily alt a mortgages from the mortgage and commercial operations and finance them with reverse repurchase borrowings from the warehouse lending operations at substantially the same terms as the mortgage and commercial operations 
when the long term investment operations finance mortgages with long term securitized mortgage borrowings  short term reverse repurchase financing is repaid 
then  depending on credit ratings from national credit rating agencies on our securitized mortgages  we are generally required to provide an over collateralization  or oc  of percent to percent of the principal balance of mortgages securing securitized mortgage financing as compared to a haircut of percent to percent of the principal balance of mortgages securing short term reverse repurchase financing 
our total capital investment in securitized mortgages generally ranges from approximately percent to percent of the principal balance of mortgages securing securitized mortgage borrowings which includes premiums paid upon acquisition of mortgages from the mortgage operations  costs paid for completion of securitized mortgages  costs to acquire derivatives and oc required to achieve desired credit ratings 
commercial mortgages are financed on a long term basis with securitized mortgage borrowings at substantially the same rates and terms as alt a mortgages 
commercial loans generally have a percent haircut on reverse repurchase lines and initial over collateralization target of percent to percent provide short term warehouse advances by the warehouse lending operations 
we utilize committed and uncommitted reverse repurchase facilities with various lenders to provide short term warehouse financing to affiliates and non affiliated clients of the warehouse lending operations 
the warehouse lending operations provide short term financing to the mortgage and commercial operations and non affiliated clients from the closing of mortgages to their sale or other settlement with investors 
the warehouse lending operations generally finance between percent and percent of the fair market value of the principal balance of mortgages  which equates to a haircut requirement of between percent and percent  respectively  at one month libor  plus a spread 
the mortgage and commercial operations have uncommitted warehouse line agreements to obtain financing from the warehouse lending operations at one month libor plus a spread during the period that the mortgage operation accumulate mortgages until the mortgages are securitized or sold 
as of december   the mortgage and commercial operations had billion and million  respectively  of warehouse advances outstanding with the warehouse lending operations 
in addition  as of december   the warehouse lending operations had million of approved warehouse lines available to non affiliated clients  of which million was outstanding 
our ability to meet liquidity requirements and the financing needs of our customers is subject to the renewal of our credit and repurchase facilities or obtaining other sources of financing  if required  including additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision our lenders or investors make to provide available financing to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors  including our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  industry and market trends in our various businesses  the general availability of  and rates applicable to  financing and investments  our lenders or investors resources and policies concerning loans and investments  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
pay common and preferred stock dividends and trust preferred payments 
we paid common stock dividends of million and preferred stock dividends of million during  which we generated from our operating activities 
we are required to distribute a minimum of percent of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to maintain our reit status  exclusive of the application of any tax loss carry forwards that may be used to offset current period taxable income 
because we pay dividends based on taxable income  dividends may be more or less than net earnings 
we paid total regular cash dividends of per common share in which met taxable income distribution requirements for the year 
we also paid interest of million attributable to the junior subordinated debt issued by the company in connection with our trust preferred offerings 
see issuance of common and preferred stock for a discussion of the terms of our outstanding series of preferred stock and note u trust preferred securities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a portion of dividends paid to imh s stockholders came from dividend distributions from the mortgage and commercial operations  a taxable reit subsidiary  to imh 
during  the mortgage and commercial operations provided a combined dividend distribution of million to imh 
because the mortgage and commercial operations may seek to retain earnings to fund the acquisition and origination of mortgages or to expand their operations  the board of directors of our taxable reit subsidiaries may decide that the mortgage and commercial operations should cease making dividend distributions in the future 
this could reduce the amount of taxable income that would be distributed to imh stockholders in the form of dividend payment amounts 
our operating businesses are primarily funded as follows securitized mortgage borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements  excess cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio  sale and securitization of mortgages  cash proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock  and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
reverse repurchase agreements and securitized mortgage borrowings 
we use reverse repurchase agreements to fund substantially all financing to affiliates and non affiliated clients and for the acquisition and origination of alt a and commercial mortgages 
as we accumulate mortgages  we finance the acquisition of mortgages primarily through borrowings on reverse repurchase facilities with third party lenders 
we primarily use uncommitted and committed facilities with major investment banks to finance substantially all warehouse financing  as needed 
during the reverse repurchase facilities borrowing limits amounted to billion  of which billion was outstanding at december  the warehouse facilities provide us with a higher aggregate credit limit to fund the acquisition and origination of mortgages at terms comparable to those we have received in the past 
these warehouse facilities may have certain covenant tests which we are required to satisfy 
for a discussion of the company s compliance with its financial covenants see note i reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  we may also receive additional uncommitted interim financing from our lenders in excess of our permanent borrowing limits to finance mortgages during the accumulation phase and prior to securitizations or whole loan sales 
from time to time  we may also utilize term reverse repurchase financing provided to us by underwriters who underwrite some of our securitizations 
the term reverse repurchase financing funds mortgages that are specifically allocated to securitization transactions  which allows us to reduce overall borrowings outstanding on reverse repurchase agreements with other lenders during the period immediately prior to the settlement of the securitization 
terms and interest rates on the term reverse repurchase facilities are generally lower than on other reverse repurchase agreements 
term reverse repurchase financing are generally repaid within days from the date funds are advanced 
we expect to continue to use short term reverse repurchase facilities to fund the acquisition of mortgages 
if we cannot renew or replace maturing borrowings  we may have to sell  on a whole loan basis  the mortgages securing these facilities  which  depending upon market conditions may result in substantial losses 
additionally  if for any reason the market value of our mortgages securing reverse repurchase facilities decline  our lenders may require us to provide them with additional equity or collateral to secure our borrowings  which may require us to sell mortgages at substantial losses 
in order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated with reverse repurchase agreements  we attempt to sell or securitize our mortgages within days from acquisition or origination 
although securitizing mortgages more frequently adds operating and securitization costs  we believe the added cost is offset as liquidity is provided more frequently with less interest rate and price volatility  as the accumulation and holding period of mortgages is shortened 
when we have accumulated a sufficient amount of mortgages  we seek to issue securitized mortgages and convert short term advances under reverse repurchase agreements to long term securitized mortgage borrowings 
the use of securitized mortgage borrowings provides the following benefits allows us to use long term financing for the duration of the securitized mortgage asset secured by the underlying mortgages  and eliminates margin calls on the borrowings that are converted from reverse repurchase agreements to securitized mortgage borrowings as well as associated derivatives used to manage interest rate risks on securitized mortgage borrowings 
during  we securitized billion of mortgages to provide long term financing for the retention of billion of primarily alt a mortgages and million of commercial mortgages 
because of the credit profile  historical loss performance and prepayment characteristics of our alt a mortgages  we have been able to borrow a higher percentage against the principal balance of mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral  which means that we have to provide less initial capital upon completion of securitized mortgages 
capital investment in the securitized mortgages is established at the time securitized mortgages are issued at levels sufficient to achieve desired credit ratings on the securities from credit rating agencies 
excess cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio 
we receive excess cash flows on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral after distributions are made to investors on securitized mortgage borrowings to the extent cash or other collateral required to maintain desired credit ratings on the securitized mortgages is fulfilled and can be used to provide funding for some of the long term investment operations activities 
excess cash flows represent the difference between principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages  adjusted by the following servicing and master servicing fees paid  premiums paid to mortgage insurers  cash payments receipts on derivatives  interest paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  pro rata early principal prepayments paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  oc requirements  actual losses  net of any gains incurred upon disposition of other real estate owned or acquired in settlement of defaulted mortgages  unpaid interest shortfall  basis risk shortfall  bond writedowns reinstated  and residual cashflow 
sale and securitization of mortgages 
we sell and securitize loans in the following ways when the mortgage and commercial operations accumulate a sufficient amount of mortgages that are intended to be deposited into a securitized mortgage trust  it sells the mortgages to the long term investment operations  when selling mortgages on a whole loan basis  the mortgage operations will accumulate mortgages and enter into sales transactions with third party investors on a monthly basis  and the mortgage and commercial operations sold billion of mortgages to the long term investment operations during and sold billion of mortgages to third party investors and through un consolidated remics and whole loan sales 
the mortgage operations sold mortgage servicing rights on all mortgages sold during the sale of mortgage servicing rights generated substantially all of its cash  which was used to acquire and originate additional mortgage assets 
since we rely significantly upon sales and securitizations to generate cash proceeds to repay borrowings and to create credit availability  any disruption in our ability to complete sales and securitizations may require us to utilize other sources of financing  which  if available at all  may be on less favorable terms 
in addition  delays in closing sales and securitizations of our mortgages increase our risk by exposing us to credit and interest rate risk for this extended period of time 
issuance of common and preferred stock 
we have a shelf registration statement that allows us to sell up to billion of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants 
by issuing new shares periodically throughout the year  we believe that we were able to utilize new capital more efficiently and profitably 
on september   the company entered into a common stock sales agreement with brinson patrick securities corporation brinson patrick for the sale of up to million shares of its common stock from time to time through brinson patrick as sales agent 
as of december   we sold  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million

cash proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
during  the company formed four wholly owned trust subsidiaries trusts for the purpose of issuing an aggregate of million of trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities 
the proceeds from the sale thereof were invested in junior subordinated debt issued by the company 
all proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities and the common securities issued by the trusts are invested in junior subordinated notes notes  which are the sole assets of the trusts 
the trusts pay dividends on the trust preferred securities at the same rate as paid by the company on the notes held by the trusts 
the company received net proceeds of million from the issuance of the trust preferred securities

inflation the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations during each of  and unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we sold whole pools of loans with recourse for borrower defaults 
when whole pools are sold as opposed to securitized  the third party has recourse against us for certain borrower defaults 
because the loans are no longer on our balance sheet  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
during  we sold billion of loans with recourse for borrower defaults compared to billion in we maintained a million reserve related to these guarantees as of december  compared with a reserve of million as of december  during we paid million in cash to repurchase loans sold to third parties 
in  we paid million in cash to repurchase loans sold to third parties in prior periods 
we subsequently finance or sell the repurchased loans 
see disclosures in the consolidated notes to the financial statements under commitments and contingencies for other arrangements that qualify as off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years securitized mortgage borrowings   reverse repurchase agreements   rate locked mortgage pipeline   trust preferred securities   premises operating lease agreements    total contractual obligations   payments on securitized mortgage borrowings are based on anticipated receipts of principal on underlying mortgage loan collateral using expected prepayment rates

in addition  prior to the consolidation of ifc on july   the method used to calculate the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends reflected the consolidated net earnings of imh less net earnings of ifc plus dividend distributions from ifc to imh 
no preferred stock dividends were paid during these periods as we did not have any preferred stock outstanding 
earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges 
the amount of the deficiency for the year ended december  was million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general overview although we manage credit  prepayment and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk  which could potentially have the largest material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
since a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from net interest income  we strive to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what we believe to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
when interest rates fluctuate  profitability can be adversely affected by changes in the fair market value of our assets and liabilities and by the interest spread earned on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we derive income from the differential spread between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
any change in interest rates affects income received and income paid from assets and liabilities in varying and typically in unequal amounts 
changing interest rates may compress or widen our interest rate margins and affect overall earnings 
interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability committee alco  which is comprised of senior management and reports results of interest rate risk analysis to the imh board of directors on at least a quarterly basis 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate sources  uses and pricing of funds 
alco also attempts to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  various modeling techniques are used to value interest sensitive mortgage backed securities  including interest only securities 
the value of investment securities available for sale is determined using a discounted cash flow model using prepayment rate  discount rate and credit loss assumptions 
our investment securities portfolio is available for sale  which requires us to perform market valuations of the securities in order to properly record the portfolio 
we continually monitor interest rates of our investment securities portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
we do not currently maintain a securities trading portfolio and are not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
changes in interest rates interest rate risk management policies are intended to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily associated with cash flows on our adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings 
our primary objective is to limit our exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to the variability of one month libor  which is the underlying index of our adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings 
we also monitor on an ongoing basis the prepayment risks that arise in fluctuating interest rate environments 
our interest rate risk management policies are formulated with the intent to offset potential adverse effects of changing interest rates on cash flows on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings 
we primarily acquire for long term investment arms and hybrid arms and  frms 
arms are generally subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
this means that the interest rate of each arm is limited to upwards or downwards movements on its periodic interest rate adjustment date  generally six months  or over the life of the mortgage 
periodic caps limit the maximum interest rate change  which can occur on any interest rate change date to generally a maximum of percent per semiannual adjustment 
also  each arm has a maximum lifetime interest rate cap 
generally  borrowings are not subject to the same periodic or lifetime interest rate limitations 
during a period of rapidly increasing or decreasing interest rates  financing costs could increase or decrease at a faster rate than the periodic interest rate adjustments on mortgages would allow  which could affect net interest income 
in addition  if market rates were to exceed the maximum interest rate limits of our arms  borrowing costs could increase while interest rates on arms would remain constant 
we also acquire hybrid arms that have initial fixed interest rate periods generally ranging from two to seven years which subsequently convert to arms 
during a rapidly increasing or decreasing interest rate environment financing costs would increase or decrease more rapidly than would interest rates on mortgages  which would remain fixed until their next interest rate adjustment date 
in order to provide protection against potential resulting basis risk shortfall on the related liabilities  we purchase derivatives 
the use of derivatives to manage risk associated with changes in interest rates is an integral part of our strategy 
the amount of cash payments or cash receipts on derivatives is determined by the notional amount of the derivative and current interest rate levels in relation to the various strikes or coupons of derivatives during a particular time period 
as of december  and december   we had notional balances of interest rate swaps  caps  and floors of billion and billion  respectively  with net fair values of million and million  respectively  pertaining to our current and pending securitizations 
by using derivatives  we attempt to minimize the effect of both upward and downward interest rate changes on our long term mortgage portfolio 
our goal is to moderate significant changes to base case net interest income  including net cash flows from derivatives  as interest rates change 
we primarily acquire swaps to essentially convert our adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings into fixed rate borrowings 
for instance  we receive one month libor on swaps  which offsets interest expense on adjustable rate securitized mortgage borrowings  and we pay a fixed interest rate 
the interest rate risk profile of our balance sheet is more sensitive to changes in interest rates related to our liabilities 
we use derivatives extensively in order to manage the interest rate  or price risk  inherent in our assets  liabilities and loan commitments 
our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate the effect of changes in interest rates on our earnings over time 
our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term 
the success of our interest rate risk management strategy is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan production operation and long term investment operations in various interest rate environments 
there are many market factors that affect the performance of our interest rate risk management activities including interest rate volatility  prepayment behavior  the shape of the yield curve and the spread between mortgage interest rates and treasury or swap rates 
the success of this strategy affects our net earnings 
this effect  which can be either positive or negative  can be material 
we measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates affecting interest sensitive assets and liabilities using various simulations 
these simulations take into consideration changes that may occur in investment and financing strategies  the forward yield curve  interest rate risk management strategies  mortgage prepayment speeds and the volume of mortgage acquisitions and originations 
as part of various interest rate simulations  we calculate the effect of potential changes in interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their affect on overall earnings 
the simulations assume instantaneous and parallel shifts in interest rates and to what degree those shifts affect net interest income 
the following table estimates the financial effect to base case  including net cash flow from derivatives  from various instantaneous and parallel shifts in interest rates based on both our consolidated structure and un consolidated structure  which refers to the notional amount of derivatives that are not recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and dollar amounts in millions changes in base case as of december  excluding net cash flow on derivatives net cash flow on derivatives including net cash flow on derivatives instantaneous and parallel change in interest rates up basis points  or up basis points  or up basis points  or down basis points or down basis points or down basis points or changes in base case as of december  excluding net cash flow on derivatives net cash flow on derivatives including net cash flow on derivatives instantaneous and parallel change in interest rates up basis points  or  up basis points  or up basis points  or down basis points or down basis points or down basis points or  the dollar and percentage changes represent base case for the next twelve months versus the change in base case using various instantaneous and parallel interest rate change simulations  excluding the effect of amortization of loan discounts to base case 
instantaneous and parallel interest rate changes over and under the projected forward yield curve 
this simulation was added to our analysis as it is relevant in light of the interest rate environment as of december  and and the projected forward yield curves for and in the previous table  the up basis point scenario as of december  represents our projection of the net change from base case net interest income  which is derived from assumptions as previously discussed  if market interest rates were to immediately decline by basis points 
this means that we increase interest rates at all data points along our projected forward yield curve by basis points and recalculate our projection of net interest income over the next months 
in addition  based on changes in interest rates  or changes in our forward yield curve  our model adjusts mortgage prepayment rates and recalculates amortization of acquisition and securitization costs and net cash receipts or payments on derivates as part of the calculation of net interest income 
thus  if a basis point interest rate increase occurred  the projected volatility to net interest income is positively impacted through our use of derivatives 
we estimated net interest income along with net cash flows from derivatives for the next twelve months using balance sheet data  the notional amount of derivatives as of december  and month projections of the following primary drivers affecting net interest income future interest rates using forward yield curves  which are considered market consensus estimates of future interest rates  mortgage acquisition and originations  mortgage prepayment rate assumptions  and forward swap rates 
we refer to the month projection of net interest income along with the month projection of net cash flows on derivatives as the base case 
for financial reporting purposes  net cash flows from derivatives are included in realized gain loss from derivative instruments on the consolidated financial statements 
however  for purposes of interest rate risk analysis we include net cash flows from derivatives in our base case simulations as we acquire derivatives to offset the effect that changes in interest rates have on variable borrowing costs  such as securitized mortgage and warehouse borrowings 
we believe that including net cash flows from derivatives in our interest rate risk analysis presents a more useful simulation of the effect of changing interest rates on net cash flows generated by our long term mortgage portfolio 
once the base case has been established  we shock the base case with instantaneous and parallel shifts in interest rates in basis point increments upward and downward 
calculations are made for each of the defined instantaneous and parallel shifts in interest rates over or under the forward yield curve used to determine the base case and include any associated changes in projected mortgage prepayment rates caused by changes in interest rates 
the results of each basis point change in interest rates are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated dollar and percentage change to base case 
the simulations consider the affect of interest rate changes on interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as derivatives 
the simulations also consider the impact that instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates have on prepayment rates and the resulting affect of accelerating or decelerating amortization of premium and securitization costs 
over the past year  the interest rate risk profile shifted from modestly liability sensitive to modestly asset sensitive 
this occurred as part of a deliberate and long term optimization strategy of accumulating hedged mortgage assets during other factors contributing to the shift in the interest rate risk profile include the increase in the overall level of interest rates  the flattening of the yield curve and changes in expected prepayment behavior 
however  since our estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided on mortgage assets and borrowings on mortgage assets  only  with respect to the following changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  changes in interest due to both rate and volume  and net change
