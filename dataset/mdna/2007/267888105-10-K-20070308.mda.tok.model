item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview our business is organized into two segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad and amk welding 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for more than of our net sales and of our income from operations of continuing operations before consideration of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for more than and  respectively  of our net sales  and more than of income from operations of continuing operations 
our net sales increased compared to  reflecting year to year net sales increases of and for our explosive metalworking and amk welding segments  respectively 
our income from operations of continuing operations increased  to  in from  in  reflecting a  improvement in explosive metalworking s operating income and a improvement in amk welding s operating income 
income from continuing operations increased  to  in from  in our net income increased to  in from  in our net income included  of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  relating to the sale of the spin forge real estate option in the first quarter and the sale of leased manufacturing equipment and tooling associated with the spin forge business in the fourth quarter 
see detailed discussion below under income from discontinued operations 
net sales explosive metalworking s net sales are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including upstream oil and gas  oil refinery  petrochemicals  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration and similar industries 
demand for our clad metal products in the united states is largely driven by plant maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing and oil refining facilities  as well as new plants and large plant expansion projects 
in contrast to the us market  demand for our clad products in europe and asia is more dependent on new construction projects  such as the building of new pta plants in different parts of the world  including china  and on sales of electrical transition joints that are used in the aluminum production industry 
amk welding s net sales are generated from welding  heat treatment and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
dmc clad s business is cyclical since it is linked to its customers end market activity 
for example  the construction cycle for new manufacturing capacity in the chemical industry has historically been one characterized by significant amplitude 
it is driven both by global economic demand growth and capacity utilization 
as capacity starts to become tight for various chemicals and prices begin to rise  new manufacturing capacity is added in relatively large incremental amounts 
excess capacity drives prices down and capacity utilization drops 
this has historically been a seven to ten year cycle 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking include the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
discontinued operations in september  we completed the sale of our spin forge division and recorded a loss from discontinued operations of  net of taxes  including a net of tax operating loss of and a net of tax loss on the divesture transactions of on january   we sold our option rights to purchase the spin forge real estate to the property owner for  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on this transaction  which was reported as discontinued operations  net of related taxes  in the first quarter of in december  we sold the spin forge equipment to the buyer of that division who had previously been leasing that equipment from us 
the sale of this equipment resulted in an additional pre tax gain on discontinued operations of we reported a net of tax income of for the full year as a result of these two transactions 
income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to in from in income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
our effective tax rate for is higher than those experienced in and as a result of the recognition in and of us tax benefits relating to research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusions and foreign tax credits 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our effective tax rate on our consolidated pre tax income to range between and 
backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our business 
we define backlog at any given point in time to consist of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
however  since orders may be rescheduled or canceled  and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
moreover  we cannot be sure of when during the future month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be sure that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the month horizon 
our backlog with respect to the explosion metalworking segment increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  and at december year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that this business segment serves 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit increased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate increased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in and the gross profit margin for amk welding increased to in from in the gross margin improvements for explosive metalworking relates primarily to the sales increases discussed above and the resultant more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
this gross margin increase also reflects favorable changes in product mix and higher average prices in with respect to both our us and european operations 
during  the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the third quarter to a high of in the fourth quarter 
the high fourth quarter gross margin rates reflects the impact of favorable margin levels on an million contract that shipped during the quarter  which involved complex materials engineering and a tight delivery schedule we expect to see continued fluctuations in our quarterly gross margin rates during that result from anticipated fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix 
general and administrative expenses percentage change change general administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase in general and administrative expenses reflects stock based compensation expense of  an impact of from annual salary adjustments and staffing changes  a increase in accrued incentive compensation expense and an aggregate increase of in legal  consulting  audit  tax advisory  and investor relations expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses remained flat at in both and selling expenses percentage change change selling expenses percentage of net sales selling expenses  which include sales commissions of  in and in  increased by to  in from  in the  increase in sales commissions is primarily attributable to large consulting fees and commissions of approximately  paid in connection with an million order that shipped during the fourth quarter and which involved complex materials engineering and a tight delivery schedule 
the remaining increase in selling expenses reflects stock based compensation expense of  an impact of from annual salary adjustments and staffing changes and a increase in accrued incentive compensation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses increased to in from in due to the large increase in sales commissions that relates principally to one order 
excluding sales commissions  selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in income from operations of continuing operations percentage change change income from operations of continuing operations income from operations increased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
amk welding reported income from operations of  in  an increase of from the that it reported in  which increase follows the sales increase 
income from operations of continuing operations in includes of stock based compensation expense an expense we did not have in 
this expense is not allocated to our business segments and thus is not included in the above operating income totals for explosive metalworking and amk welding 
stock based compensation expense in is expected to be at least double the amount that we reported in interest income expense  net percentage change change interest income expense  net nm we recorded net interest income of in compared to net interest expense of in  an improvement of this change in net interest income expense reflects a significant decrease in average outstanding borrowings year to year and the large cash balances we are currently carrying 
income tax provision percentage change change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall 
income from discontinued operations percentage change change income from discontinued operations na we completed the divestiture of our spin forge division in september under the principal divestiture agreement  we sold the assets of the spin forge division to a third party  excluding certain equipment and real estate which were leased or subleased to the buyer 
we held a purchase option on the spin forge real estate that allowed us to purchase the real estate for  a price that was below the real estate s appraised value 
we completed the sale of the purchase option on the spin forge real estate on january  the option rights were sold to the property owner for  on january  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on this transaction  which was reported in discontinued operations  net of related taxes 
in december  the third party purchaser of the spin forge business purchased the majority of the leased equipment while the remainder of the leased assets was liquidated by the company 
these transactions resulted in a pre tax gain of  which was recorded in discontinued operations  net of related taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that this business segment serves 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit increased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate increased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in and the gross profit margin for amk welding increased to in from in the gross margin improvements for both explosive metalworking and amk welding relate primarily to the sales increases discussed above and the resultant more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
the explosive metalworking gross margin increase also reflects higher average prices in  particularly with respect to our european operations 
general and administrative expenses percentage change change general administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase in general and administrative expenses reflects an aggregate increase of in audit  tax consulting and investor relations expenses  a increase in accrued incentive compensation expense  and the impact of annual salary adjustments 
the increases in audit  tax advisory  consulting and investor relations expenses relates primarily to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  tax planning initiatives and increased investor relations activities 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decreased percentage is attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
selling expenses percentage change change selling expense percentage of net sales selling expenses increased by to  in from  in the increase in selling expenses reflects an increase in outside sales commissions paid to third party agents that represent dmc in certain countries  and is attributable to the sales increase 
as a result of the significant increase in net sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in income from operations of continuing operations percentage change change income from operations of continuing operations income from operations increased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
amk welding reported income from operations of in  an increase of from the that it reported in  which increase follows the sales increase 
interest expense  net percentage change change interest expense  net net interest expense decreased by to in from in this decrease in net interest expense reflects a significant decrease in average outstanding borrowings during that resulted from the pay down of bank line of credit borrowings and snpe s conversion of a  convertible subordinated note into our common stock 
income tax provision percentage change change income tax provision effective tax rate we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall 
loss from discontinued operations percentage change change loss from discontinued operations na we completed the divestiture of our spin forge division in september under the principal divestiture agreement  we sold the assets of the spin forge division to a third party  excluding certain equipment and real estate which were leased or subleased to the buyer  for a sales price of approximately  to be paid in cash according to the arrangement set forth in the divestiture agreement 
with respect to the spin forge manufacturing equipment and tooling  we recorded an after tax impairment loss of based upon the difference between the carrying value of the equipment and the present value of the future minimum equipment lease payments from the lessee plus estimated liquidation proceeds at the end of the minimum lease term 
the loss from discontinued operations of  includes a net of tax loss of from the spin forge divestiture  which reflects the asset impairment loss discussed above plus divestiture transaction costs  and the net of tax operating loss of that spin forge reported from january through september  as discussed above  we sold the majority of the leased assets to the lessee and liquidated the remaining equipment in december a pre tax gain of was reported on these transactions in we held a purchase option on the spin forge real estate that allowed us to purchase the real estate for  a price that was below the real estate s appraised value 
the value inherent in the real estate purchase option was believed to be significant but was not considered in the calculation of the above reported impairment loss on the spin forge equipment and tooling due to uncertainties surrounding its ultimate realization 
as discussed above  we completed the sale of the purchase option on the spin forge real estate on january  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies  including our ability to secure new customer orders at our operating divisions  and to continue to implement cost effective internal processes 
debt and other contractual obligations and commitments any restriction on the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements 
the table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period as of december  less than more than year years years years total term loan with french bank total debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total reflected in accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
expected interest payments on the above debt obligations are not expected to be significant for the years presented

critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  we provide currently for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets and held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on reporting units one level below the segment level and any impairment is based on the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises earlier 
the entire amount of goodwill  which had a carrying value of on our balance sheet as of december   relates to our explosives metalworking segment 
based on the analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  no impairment was recorded to the carrying value of goodwill 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses  which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income and  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
during  we completed an analysis of prior year tax credits and related items 
as a result of the analysis  we filed amended federal and state income tax returns 
the amended state returns reported additional net operating losses and credits above the amounts we had previously recorded in our books and records 
in assessing these additional losses and credits  we determined that the utilization of a portion of these did not meet the more likely than not criteria  due to potential changes in the states in which we have income tax nexus 
thus  we recorded a net valuation allowance of approximately against the deferred tax assets during as of december   the balance of this allowance is stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those appearing or disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
forward looking statements this annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigations reform act of these statements include information with respect to our financial condition and its results of operations and businesses 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  continue  project and similar expressions  as well as statements in the future tense  identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices  the size and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in customer demand  competitive factors  the timely completion of contracts  the timing and size of expenditures  the timely receipt of government approvals and permits  the adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities  the availability and cost of funds  and general economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
the effects of these factors are difficult to predict 
new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date of this annual report and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
in addition  see risk factors for a discussion of these and other factors 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin seeks to harmonize certain accounting practices associated with the recognition and measurement of income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet determined the impact this interpretation will have on its results from operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  primarily debt obligations 
since most of our obligations carry variable interest rates  there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of those obligations 
as of december  dollars in thousands term loan with french bank variable rate interest rate the functional currencies for the foreign operations of nobelclad and nitro metall are the euro and the swedish krona  respectively 
thus  the major foreign exchange risks relate to the euro swedish krona and euro us dollar conversion rates 
additionally  we occasionally enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency  which exposes us to other foreign exchange risks 
sales made in currencies other than us dollars accounted for  and of total sales for the years ended  and  respectively
