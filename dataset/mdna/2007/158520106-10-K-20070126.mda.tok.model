item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a commercial printer  business forms manufacturer and office products and office furniture supplier in regional markets of the united states of america  east of the mississippi river 
the company has grown through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
through such growth  the company has realized regional economies of scale  operational efficiencies  and exposure of its core products to new markets 
the company has acquired fifteen printing companies  eight office products and office furniture companies  one company with a combined emphasis on both printing and office products and office furniture and a paper distribution division which was subsequently sold in since its initial public offering on january  the company s net revenues consist primarily of sales of commercial printing  business forms  tags  other printed products  document output solutions including rendering  inserting and mailing  office supplies  office furniture  data products and office design services 
the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to the customer 
the company s revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by variations in demand for its products 
the company s cost of sales primarily consists of raw materials  including paper  ink  pre press supplies and purchased office supplies  furniture and data products  and manufacturing costs including direct labor  indirect labor and overhead 
significant factors affecting the company s cost of sales include the costs of paper in both printing and office supplies  the costs of labor and other raw materials 
the company s operating costs consist of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs include salaries  commissions and wages for sales  customer service  accounting  administrative and executive personnel  rent  utilities  legal  audit  information systems equipment costs  software maintenance and depreciation 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and that the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows requires significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in the md a 
beginning in fiscal year  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill and other intangibles 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangibles 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  goodwill and other intangibles are recorded at the adjusted book value and were analyzed for impairment with the implementation of sfas the fair value of the company s goodwill and other intangibles was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies 
based on the analysis  the company determined that fair value relating to goodwill and other intangibles resulted in an implied fair value greater than the book value recorded for the corresponding goodwill and other intangibles  and therefore  no impairment was recognized in any period subsequent to the adoption of this statement 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill and other intangibles impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  sfas requires that the goodwill and other intangibles be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
management has discussed the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  the board of directors has reviewed this disclosure and its relation to md a 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company encounters risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  the company compares the identified credit risks with the allowance that has been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
management has discussed the development and selection of this estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the board has  in turn  reviewed the disclosure and its relation to md a 
during  and    and  of bad debt expense was incurred and the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  as of october   and the actual write offs for the periods were   and  during  and general economic conditions and specific geographic and customer concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in the financial position and results of operations of the company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein

operating expenses and income selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased million to million in from million in s  g a as a percentage of net sales represented of net sales in compared with of net sales in this increase is primarily related to the syscan acquisition reflecting a full year of expenses in compared with two months of expenses in and approximately  in legal related costs associated with various legal settlement accruals and expenses  including a  settlement related to a mississippi lawsuit 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales is a result of personnel reductions at several divisions resulting in lower personnel costs as a percent of sales 
on august   hurricane katrina made landfall and subsequently caused extensive flooding and destruction along the coastal areas of the gulf of mexico  including new orleans and other communities in louisiana and mississippi in which champion conducts business 
operations in many of the company s markets were disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to the company s operating facility in new orleans 
the company s production operations were relocated from the new orleans facility to the baton rouge facility in the fourth quarter of the company has filed insurance claims related to both actual and contingent losses 
however  the company to date has received no insurance funds or any indication of the amount the insurance companies are willing to pay related to such claims 
therefore  the company has recorded no insurance related receivables 
as a result of hurricane katrina  the company incurred charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter of these charges were primarily a result of facilities related costs  equipment costs  operational costs from lost business and uncollectible receivables  personnel costs  inventory related costs and relocation related costs as a result of the hurricane 
the company is currently unable to accurately assess the long term effects of hurricane katrina on its business and on the macro operating environment in the gulf states in which the company operates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended october  compared to year ended october  for an update regarding hurricane katrina 
other income expense other expense increased approximately  from  in to  in  due to lower other income primarily related to the gains on the sale of two buildings during and a casualty gain resulting from a roof collapse at one division in interest expense increased  primarily as a result of an increase in interest rates and higher outstanding borrowings 
income taxes income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were in compared with in the decrease in income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes is primarily related to lower nondeductible selling related expenses as a percentage of pre tax income

net income for reasons set forth above  net income for increased approximately  to million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  from net income of  for  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from the prior year 
working capital as of october  was million  a decrease from million at october  the company has historically used cash generated from operating activities and debt to finance capital expenditures and the cash portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
management plans to continue making significant investments in equipment and to seek appropriate acquisition candidates 
however  to fund the company s continued expansion of operations  additional financing may be necessary 
the company has two available lines of credit totaling million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for the foreseeable future including through fiscal  management believes it can fund operations  meet debt service requirements and make the planned capital expenditures based on the available cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and lines of credit 
additionally  the company has minimal amounts of future contracted obligations see note and note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company is not a guarantor of indebtedness of others 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements at october  relate to the syscan acquisition and are associated with a put option from williams land corporation to sell a building to the company for million 
this option may be exercised no later than days prior to the end of the lease and closing of said purchase cannot exceed days from the end of the lease 
as of october   the company had contractual obligations in the form of leases  debt  contingent acquisition payment and equipment purchase obligations as follows payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total non cancelable operating leases term debt equipment purchase obligations  contingent purchase price acquisition  the company entered into a purchase commitment for a printing press with a manufacturer for  as a result of this commitment  the company paid this manufacturer a deposit of  and received an associated trade in allowance of  as of october  cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for the years ended october   and were million  million and million 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year compared to was primarily reflective of additional cash generated in from higher net income 
the cash flow increase from operating activities for the fiscal year compared to was reflective of additional cash generated in from changes in assets and liabilities  increased depreciation and amortization expense and higher net income 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended october   and cash flows used in investing activities increased slightly in compared to due to higher capital expenditures 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased in compared to due to lower capital expenditures and no acquisitions in cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in and provided by financing activities for the years ended october   and were million  million and million 
during  the company reduced net borrowings by approximately million and  after adjusting for non cash investing and financing activities  reduced net borrowings by million 
this coupled with dividend payments of million  partially offset by stock option proceeds  was reflective of net cash used in financing activities during during  the company reduced net borrowings by approximately million thus coupled with dividend payments of million was reflective of net cash used in financing activities during during  net borrowings exceeded cash payments thus generating cash flow from financing activities 
dividends paid in were million and million per year in and inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  an increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its profitability in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter 
newly issued accounting standards sab in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the rollover method and the iron curtain method 
the rollover method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
we currently use the rollover method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the rollover methods 
sab permits existing public companies to initially apply its provisions by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities as of november  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we will initially apply the provisions of sab using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ending october  when we initially apply the provisions of sab  we currently anticipate an increase in fixed assets of approximately  an increase in accounts receivable of approximately  a decrease in accrued payroll of approximately  a decrease in accrued professional fees of approximately  and an increase in retained earnings of approximately  net of tax  as of november  
the accompanying financial statements do not reflect these adjustments 
fin in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the financial statements 
eitf in june  the fasb emerging issues tax force eitf issued eitf how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charges for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to eitf are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the second quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any significant exposure relating to market risk
