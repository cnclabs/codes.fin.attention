item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see risk factors under item a of this report regarding certain factors known to us that could affect our future operating results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in as of march   we have grown to restaurants  including company operated  three licensed locations and one franchised location 
we position our restaurants in the high quality  fresh and distinctive fast casual mexican cuisine segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become a leading brand in this industry segment 
during  we continued to focus on ways to improve our economic model 
we believe that shifting our focus to great taste rather than price and increasing the price of our combo meals were two key drivers for our sales growth during the fourth quarter 
in addition  we priced our promotional events at higher points and provided our guests with more food and sides than before 
we also invested in research to better understand our guests needs and how we compare to our competition 
we have commenced a number of additional initiatives with the goal to improve to go orders and catering from a guest convenience view point as well as multiple in restaurant programs to improve overall service and satisfaction 
our average unit volume  which includes stores open for at least months  increased from  to  due to an increase in comparable store sales of and the closure of one underperforming unit 
we opened nine new restaurants in and plan to open to new restaurants in  with an annual growth rate of to per year for the next three to five years 
all of the new openings in have the new d cor that was developed during and was the basis for our system wide re image program 
the majority of these restaurants are outperforming their district peers for average weekly sales 
on the cost and expense side of our economic model  we are experiencing increases in cost of sales 
the demand for seafood is ahead of the short term supply driving up this cost 
in addition  we have increased serving sizes to improve the value proposition 
the recent changes in strategy have allowed us to experience higher sales which in turn is allowing us to better leverage some of our fixed costs in labor and occupancy 
general and administrative costs increased significantly in primarily due to the settlement of our class action lawsuit 
we have added head count to allow us to execute our development plans as well as to better support our restaurants through hiring  developing and training our new team members 
as we continue to add new restaurants  and combined with the elimination of significant litigation defense costs approximately million in and  we will be able to leverage our general and administrative costs at a better rate than we have historically 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current information available  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
asset impairment and store closure expense reversal we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when a restaurant experiences a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or a store closure 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual restaurants that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets at each restaurant  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of based on the discounted projected cash flows derived from the restaurant 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis are those used to estimate a restaurant s future cash flows 
we use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on restaurant specific information 
if the significant assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating restaurant assets  as well as the related impairment charge  may be overstated or understated 
we estimate that it takes a new restaurant approximately months to reach operating efficiency 
any restaurant open months or less  therefore  is not included in the analysis of long lived asset impairment  unless other events or circumstances arise 
we make decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
we record losses associated with the closure of a restaurant at the time the unit is closed 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
the amount of our store closure liability  and related store closure charges  may decrease if we are successful in either terminating a lease early or obtaining a more favorable sublease  and may increase if any of our sublessee s default on their leases 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to our restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because the factors used to estimate impairment and store closure expense are subject to change  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
property property is stated at cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the leasing and construction of restaurant facilities 
the costs of buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include development costs  construction costs  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the acquisition or construction stage 
salaries and related costs capitalized totaled   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization of buildings  leasehold improvements  and equipment are computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the initial lease term for certain leased properties buildings and improvements range from to years  and equipment to years 
for leases with renewal periods at the company s option  the company generally uses the original lease term  excluding renewal option periods to determine useful lives  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the company  management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives 
the company s policy requires lease term consistency when calculating the depreciation period  in classifying the lease  and in computing straight line rent expense 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for a portion of our workers compensation insurance program 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence was  during each of our claim years ended october    and we account for insurance liabilities based on independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of industry wide and rubio s specific historical claim loss development 
our actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the accrual  and our operating expenses will increase or decrease accordingly 
consistent with trends the restaurant industry has experienced in recent years  particularly in california where claim loss trends are among the highest in the country  workers compensation liability premiums continue to increase 
revenue recognition revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue is comprised of i area development fees  ii new store opening fees  and iii royalties 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements under individual franchise agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis as the individual franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements are opened 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchised location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between fiscal   and refer to the week period ended december  and the week periods ended december   and december  the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  with respect to certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor restaurant occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses asset impairment and store closure expense reversal loss on disposal sale of property operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss as a percentage of restaurant sales the following table summarizes the number of restaurants december  december  december  company operated franchised and licensed locations total revenues total revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from several factors first  we opened nine new stores in fiscal which contributed sales of million  second  stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base contributed sales of million  third  we acquired five franchise locations during fiscal which contributed million  and fourth  comparable store sales contributed million 
of the million increase attributable to comparable store sales  million was due to the one extra week in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales from one store that closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and two stores that closed during the third quarter of fiscal year units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the average check amount  which was offset by a decrease in the number of transactions 
comparable store sales increased in comparison to prior year 
the company s average unit volume was  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily due to sales of million from our four store openings  million from stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base and an increase in comparable store sales of million 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales from the one store that closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in comparable stores sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the average check amount  along with a increase in the number of transactions 
costs and expenses cost of sales increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in the number of company operated restaurants and one additional week in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of sales increased to in fiscal  as compared with in fiscal and in the percentage increase in fiscal as compared with fiscal is a direct result of higher seafood costs and transitioning our stores from pre cut fish purchases to a pre battered fish product during early branding initiatives such as increased fish portions and enhanced flavors have also impacted the cost of some of the premium products 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower produce costs  primarily avocados 
fiscal percentage improvements were driven by operational efficiencies and a decrease in the cost of chicken 
restaurant labor costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of our ability to leverage our costs with the increase in revenues  lower workers compensation expenses  and less labor required due to the switch to the pre battered fish product 
restaurant occupancy and other costs increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and increased from in fiscal this decrease in fiscal from is primarily the result of our ability to leverage our costs with the increase in revenues and the decision to focus advertising spend in the los angeles market during the fourth quarter to a local marketing approach versus more expensive radio spots 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily the result of increased advertising  higher credit card usage costs  delivery fees due to higher usage as a percentage of restaurant sales  utilities  non recurring expenses in common area maintenance and property taxes 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  these costs were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the primary driver of this increase was the accrual of approximately million for the settlement of the class action wage and hour lawsuit and related costs 
in addition  we also expensed approximately million in legal fees related to this class action lawsuit 
we have added personnel to support our development and re imaging program and marketing efforts 
lastly  the adoption of sfas r for stock based compensation accounted for  of the increase 
fiscal s increase in operating expenses were a result of large operating expenses outside of our normal restaurant operations support 
legal and professional fees for previous years consolidated financial statement restatements  sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts and on going litigation defense amounted to million for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  an additional million was recorded related to executive separation of  severance and  revaluation of stock options  legal fees and lobster lawsuit settlement costs of  other legal and professional fees of  executive search and relocation expenses of  and other miscellaneous expenses of  depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new restaurants added in and as well as with the restaurant re imaging program 
fiscal also has one additional week as compared to fiscal and fiscal pre opening expenses increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  we opened nine restaurants compared to five during fiscal and six during fiscal pre opening costs in also increased from prior years as we now open our restaurants with a very specific local marketing plan that costs approximately  per location 
costs were lower in fiscal due in part to the fact that one of the restaurants opened in fiscal was a replacement unit  and  as such  training costs were minimal 
asset impairment and store closure expense reversal was comprised of a  reversal in fiscal  as compared to a  charge in fiscal  and compared with a net reversal of  during fiscal in the second quarter of  a store closure reversal of  was recorded   of which was due to the company entering into a new sublease agreement at its portland  oregon location 
an additional reversal of  was recorded in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company reversed  of the store closure accrual due to a sub tenant occupying its space longer than anticipated at the signing of the sub lease 
the  charge during fiscal was the net effect of a charge to impairment of  for the closure of the portland  oregon restaurant  combined with a reversal to store closure of  based on the recalculation of the closed store accrual for a phoenix  arizona restaurant 
the  reversal in fiscal was the net effect of a  increase to reflect additional expenses incurred to final a suitable sublessee  combined with a  reversal to reflect additional sublease income received 
other income increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal although our total cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments have decreased in each of the past three years  the interest and investment income has increased year over year due to rising interest rates 
fiscal also has one additional week of interest and investment income as compared to fiscal and fiscal the provision for income taxes for fiscal   and is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income or loss 
our fiscal annual income tax benefit rate of consisted of our statutory blended federal and state income tax rate applied against our pretax book loss and increased by the benefit of federal and california targeted employment tax credits that were claimed 
during fiscal  we reduced our fiscal projected annual rate due to our tax planning initiatives 
the tax benefit applied to fiscal comprises the federal and state statutory rate benefit  increased by additional benefit for federal and california targeted employment tax credits  tax exempt interest and for prior year california targeted employment tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits benefited during the tax rate applied to fiscal consisted of the federal and state statutory rates adjusted for benefits associated with federal employment tax credits and tax exempt interest 
seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor and insurance costs 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor  and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to insurance and utility expenses has had a material impact on our results of operations in  and liquidity and capital resources since we became public in  we have funded our capital requirements through bank debt and cash flows from operations 
we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures  used to reacquire franchised locations  and million in purchases of investments  offset by  in proceeds received from the sale of property and million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
the increase in capital expenditures in as compared to and was primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in new store openings  as well as our re imaging program 
during  we re imaged of our restaurants  as compared to in and none in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of proceeds received from exercises of common stock options of million and excess tax benefits from shared based compensation of  million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and consisted of proceeds received from exercises of common stock options 
in  the company obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to the company s workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit is subject to automatic one year extensions from the expiration date and thereafter  unless notification is made prior to the expiration date 
in december  this letter of credit was increased to million 
the letter of credit was extended in october  october  and again in october the company was also required  under the terms of the letters of credit  to pledge collateral of million in  and million in we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million for restaurant openings  restaurant re imaging  maintenance  and for corporate and information technology 
we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant  which includes approximately  to  of non cash rent expense during the build out period 
we believe that the anticipated cash flows from operations combined with our cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and class action settlement obligations for the foreseeable future 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years company operated retail locations and other operating leases settlement of class action lawsuit impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the fasb s statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  however  we are still in the process of evaluating the potential impact  if any 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensuses of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf indicates that the statement of operations presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision 
our accounting policy is to present the taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   the year beginning december  for the company 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
as of december   we had no investments with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of our investments and debt instruments  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a significant negative effect on our financial results 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than one year 
we do not believe that these purchase commitments are material to our operations as a whole 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources
