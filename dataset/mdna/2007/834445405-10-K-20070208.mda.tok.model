overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos system  a non invasive patient monitoring system that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen levels in the brain 
we began commercializing our model invos system internationally in the third quarter of fiscal and in the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal unlike earlier models  the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
from product launch until the first quarter of fiscal  we focused our marketing efforts primarily on adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries and carotid artery surgeries 
during the second quarter of fiscal  results of both the first prospective  randomized clinical trial and a larger retrospective review evaluating the invos system were presented  which we believe have contributed to the invos system gaining further market penetration 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated selling and marketing efforts for the invos system in the pediatric intensive care unit  or icu 
we plan to launch the product into the neonatal icu in early  after completing development of a smaller somasensor 
we are currently sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age if results of this trial are positive  we intend to target more actively the sale of the invos system for use in diabetic patients undergoing major general surgeries  consistent with fda requirements 
we expect to begin this marketing in in november  we received k clearance from the fda to market our invos system to monitor changes in somatic tissue blood oxygen saturation in regions of the body other than the brain in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
our next generation invos system monitor  which we launched in the second quarter of  can display information from four somasensors  which allows for the simultaneous monitoring of changes in blood oxygen saturation in the brain and  in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow  in somatic tissue 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november  we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states  and in april we met the requirements under the european medical device directive to use the ce mark  thereby allowing us to market the product in the european economic community 
however  in september  the european economic community changed its regulations  limiting approval authority for animal tissue implant products sold in europe to some independent registration agencies that do not include our registrar 
sales of correstore systems represented one percent of our fiscal net revenues 
we expect that as sales of our invos system increase  the correstore system will become an even less significant component of our business 
net revenues and cost of sales we derive our revenues from sales of invos systems and correstore systems to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales team and independent sales representative firms 
outside the united states  we have distribution agreements with independent distributors for the invos system  including tyco healthcare in europe  canada  the middle east and africa  and edwards lifesciences ltd 
in japan 
our cost of sales represent the cost of 
table of contents producing monitors and disposable somasensors 
revenues from outside the united states contributed percent to our fiscal net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  the gross margins from our international sales are typically lower than gross margins from our us sales  reflecting the difference between the prices we receive from distributors and from direct customers 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for us sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our invos system revenues are derived from the sale of monitors and our disposable somasensors 
we intend that disposables will form the basis of a recurring revenue stream 
we expect the percentage of revenue from disposables to increase over time as our installed base of monitors grows 
we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years  and this depreciation is included in cost of goods sold 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our employees and consultants  sales and marketing expenses  such as employee sales commissions  commissions to independent sales representatives  travel  entertainment  advertising  education and training expenses  depreciation of demonstration monitors and attendance at selected medical conferences  clinical research expenses  such as costs of supporting clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses  such as the cost of corporate operations  professional services  insurance  warranty and royalty expenses  investor relations  depreciation and amortization  facilities expenses and other general operating expenses 
we have increased the size of our direct sales team from persons at the end of fiscal to persons at the end of fiscal we expect to increase the size of our us direct sales team in fiscal and are evaluating placing direct salespersons and clinical specialists in europe to support tyco healthcare 
we also expect our clinical research expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age as a result  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our research and development personnel and consultants  costs of various development projects  and costs of preparing and processing applications for fda clearance of new products 
for the fiscal year ended november   we recorded a research and development expense of  in connection with our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement with neurophysics corporation

recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of results of operations fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues 
our net revenues increased  or percent  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in us sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in us sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of  or percent  primarily as a result of a percent increase in somasensor unit sales 
in addition  sales of the invos system monitor in the united states increased  or percent  primarily as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals after the launch of our products into the pediatric icu in the first quarter of fiscal  and an increase in international sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased purchases of the invos system monitor and disposable somasensor by tyco healthcare in europe

table of contents gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and percent for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a five percent increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states and increased sales of the invos system monitors to pediatric hospitals in the united states 
the increase in our average selling prices in the united states is attributable to increased sales of our pediatric somasensor  which sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor  and to the addition of new customers at our higher suggested retail prices 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by increased purchases of our next generation invos system monitor and disposable sensor by tyco healthcare  due to the lower margin we receive on sales to our distributors 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a  initial fee under our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement entered into with neurophysics corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect our research  development and engineering expenses to increase in fiscal from the level in fiscal  excluding the  expense under our contract development and exclusive licensing agreement 
we expect this increase primarily as a result of development costs associated with our smaller somasensor  development costs associated with advances to the design and performance features of the invos system  including the disposable somasensor  and the hiring of additional research and development personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november   primarily due to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and an increase in salaries of existing employees  an  increase in travel  marketing and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales personnel and increased sales and marketing activities  primarily sales training and trade shows  an  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and hiring additional sales employees in fiscal  a  increase in professional service fees  primarily due to increased legal and consulting fees  a  increase in stock compensation expense due to stock compensation issued to directors  officers  employees and a consultant in fiscal  a  increase in office and facilities expenses primarily as a result of increased employees and increased insurance costs  and a  increase in depreciation expense due to increased capitalized tooling for our next generation invos system 
during fiscal we incurred an impairment expense of  as a result of the write down of our intangible asset associated with the acquisition of the license for the correstore system 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal and  increased employee sales commissions payable as a result of increased sales  increased clinical research expense  increased stock compensation expenses  and increased sales and marketing expenses 
other income 
during fiscal  interest income increased to  from  in fiscal  primarily due to our increased cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investment balances as a result of the proceeds from our public offering of common shares that closed in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased interest rates

we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 

table of contents the increase in inventories described above is greater than shown on our balance sheet because it includes invos system monitors that we capitalized because they are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment 
we capitalized  of costs from inventory for invos system monitors being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment at customers during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized  in costs for invos system monitors being used as demonstration and no capital cost sales equipment  and these assets have a net book value of  we depreciate these assets over five years

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and requires an assessment of the probability of the validity of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns for recognition in financial statements 

table of contents only tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold of being sustained are recognized under fin fin also provides guidance on classification of interest and penalties and accounting and disclosures for annual and interim financial statements 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning december  the cumulative effect of the changes arising from the initial application of fin is required to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission released sab no 
regarding the effects of prior year misstatements on assessing the materiality of current year misstatements 
sab provides that if an error has occurred and was immaterial in a number of previous years  the cumulative effect should be considered in assessing the materiality of the error in the current year 
if the cumulative effect of the error is material  then the current year financial statements should be restated 
in the case of prior year statements  previously filed reports do not need to be amended if the error was considered immaterial to the prior year s financial statements 
however the statements should be amended the next time they are filed 
this guidance is applicable for our fiscal year ending november  additional disclosure would be required regarding any cumulative adjustments made in the current year financial statements 
we do not believe the adoption of this sab will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to our accounting treatment of stock compensation of employees  our accounting treatment for income taxes  and our revenue recognition associated with our no capital cost sales program 
stock compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  we adopted this statement for fiscal using a modified prospective application and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
we previously accounted for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense was charged against income for fiscal and for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
stock based compensation of consultants and advisors was determined based on the fair value of the options or warrants on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 estimated using the black scholes model 
the resulting amount was recognized as compensation expense and an increase in additional paid in capital over the vesting period of the options or warrants 
as a result  we recorded  of compensation expense  and an equal increase in additional paid in capital  for stock options vesting in favor of non employees in fiscal in november  we approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options as of november  the primary purpose of this accelerated vesting was to eliminate compensation expense we would recognize in our results of operations upon the adoption of sfas r  which was effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  after the effects of the accelerated vesting  the initial adoption of sfas r was immaterial with respect to options granted before december  the issuance of additional stock compensation under the stock incentive plan in fiscal had an impact on our financial statements 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our officers  employees  directors and one of our consultants  and we issued  restricted common shares to our officers 
these stock options and restricted shares were issued at the market price on the date of grant  and they vest and are expensed in the financial statements over five years 
as a result of the stock options and restricted common shares that we granted during 
table of contents fiscal  we have recorded  in stock compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r  which caused basic and diluted earning per share to decrease by 
per share 
the fair value of the stock option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility the measure by which the stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during the period  risk free rate approximate us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant of  expected lives of years  and a dividend yield of 
the fair value of the restricted common shares was estimated based on the market value of the common shares on the date of issuance 
during fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  and in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options that vested in fiscal using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of  or per diluted common share 
for fiscal  had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options that vested in fiscal  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of  or per diluted common share 
income taxes we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding realization of our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses over our history up to the most recent four fiscal years  and our forecast for future net income 
our assessment of our deferred tax assets  and the reversal of part of our valuation allowance  included assuming that our net revenues and pre tax income will grow in future years consistent with the growth guidance given for fiscal and making allowance for the uncertainties surrounding  among other things  our future rate of growth in net revenues  the rate of adoption of our products in the marketplace  and the potential for competition to enter the marketplace 
in reversing a portion of our valuation allowance  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
during fiscal  we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  related to the expected future benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during fiscal  we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of an additional net deferred tax asset of  during  we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of an additional net deferred tax asset of  for fiscal and  the reversal of our valuation allowance was net of recorded taxes 
for the fiscal year ended november   the recorded net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a net deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the fiscal year ended november   the recorded net income tax benefit of  consisted of income tax expense recorded at an estimated effective tax rate of percent in the amount of  for the first three quarters of fiscal  and a deferred tax benefit of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the effect of recognizing this asset on our balance sheet  and associated tax benefit on our statement of operations  is to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share  and to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
given the assumptions inherent in our financial plans  it is possible to calculate a different value for our deferred tax asset by changing one or more of the variables in our assessment 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our financial plans was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the plan were appropriate 
no capital cost sales revenue recognition we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the 
table of contents shipment of the invos system monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the invos system monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years 
we believe this is consistent with our stated revenue recognition policy  which is compliant with staff accounting bulletin no
