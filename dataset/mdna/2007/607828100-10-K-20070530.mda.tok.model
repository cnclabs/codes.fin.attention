item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
founded in  the company is in its st year of operation with a long history of profitability 
we operate on continents  in countries  with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in automobiles  light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems  off highway and industrial equipment 
our products are also in fuel cell applications and electronic equipment 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  exhaust gas recirculation egr coolers  and electronics cooling solutions 
consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche highway  off highway and industrial end markets 
we will achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
in order to reach our goal  our strategy is diversification by geography and by end market 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and  operational and financial discipline for improved profitability and long term stability 
effective execution of these strategies will assist us in meeting our long term financial goals of roace of percent to percent  revenue growth of percent to percent  total debt to capital ratio below percent  and gross margins of percent to percent 
development of new products and technologies for increasingly diverse end markets our heritage and a current competitive strength is our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new  emerging markets 
we own three global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the united states  in bonlanden  germany  and in asan city  korea 
our reputation for providing quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with few product warranty issues 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers who recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and are patent protected 
we hold over  patents on our technologies and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 
in fiscal  we spent million representing approximately percent of selling  general and administrative expenses on our product and technology research and development efforts 
during fiscal  we determined that the research and development costs disclosed in prior fiscal years improperly excluded certain costs incurred at three foreign locations 
this omission was corrected in the current year and all research and development discussion within form k has been revised accordingly 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this omission 
strategic planning and corporate development we employ both a short term and longer term five year strategic planning process enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  both by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
for the most part  we generate our ideas for potential acquisitions internally 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our success from this process has been our expansion activities into niche hvac and refrigeration markets 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
to support this focus we operate our plants using various continuous improvement tools such as kaizen  lean manufacturing  six sigma and others 
we operate with a small plant philosophy  enabling greater flexibility to manage our asset base  our capacity  and relationships with employees 
we also seek low cost sourcing when and where appropriate 
we are accelerating our efforts in this area as costs for materials and purchased parts rose dramatically in the past months  primarily due to global increases in the metals commodity markets 
to counter these rising materials prices  we have entered into contracts with some of our customers which provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
in addition  in april  we entered into a hedging strategy to mitigate our exposure to changing aluminum prices  which is our largest materials component 
we are currently hedging percent of our aluminum needs over the next six months 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  enabling increased profitability and cash flows over the long term 
we employ a value based management financial focus  with particular emphasis on working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals driving past and current improvement in global cash management  debt reduction and access to credit 
this focus has given us the flexibility to capitalize on acquisition opportunities  other investments and joint ventures  research and development  stock buy backs  and dividends 
it also helps us identify and take action on underperforming assets in our portfolio  such as our recent announcement of our intention to explore strategic alternatives for the electronics cooling business 
our executive management incentive compensation is based on a return on net assets calculation that drives our singular focus for alignment with shareholders interests when it comes to our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees which is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the performance of the company over a time frame greater than a year 
this plan is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards which are based on a mix of earnings per share growth and growth in our stock price 
consolidated market conditions and trends we are experiencing unprecedented market conditions that will extend into our fiscal year 
in general  our customers are demanding that we continue to provide our high quality products at a lower price 
at the same time  we are experiencing dramatic increases in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  and stainless steel nickel 
raw materials and purchased components represent approximately percent of our cost of goods sold 
approximately percent of base material increases are subject to pass through to our customers on a lag basis 
this lag period can average up to a year  based on the agreements we have with an individual customer  and our customers are pushing back on our attempts to pass these costs on 
in addition to our negotiations to pass costs on to our customers  our strategy to mitigate growing cost pressures is to accelerate new product development and geographic expansion into new and existing niche markets 
as well  we continue to focus on developing new and expanded proprietary technology that is of more value in the marketplace such as our early stage development of fuel cell technology for energy  vehicular and other applications 
we executed on our stated goals of geographic and end market diversification with the acquisition of the remaining percent of modine brazil  our brazilian joint venture  in may modine brazil provides thermal management solutions to the automotive  truck  agricultural and construction equipment  and industrial application markets  as well as the automotive aftermarket for export and for distribution throughout south america 
it manufactures a wide array of modules and heat exchanger components for oems including radiators  charge air coolers  and oil coolers 
the purchase price totaled approximately million  and included a million note payable in months and an agreement to pay an additional million based on certain future performance goals 
this acquisition was accretive to our results of operations in fiscal  and it supports the geographic expansion of our business 
our response to current market conditions in response to the unprecedented near term conditions facing the company  we implemented several strategies over the year to mitigate the effects these pressures have on our margins and our goals for profitable growth and return targets 
the elements and benefits included o reduce selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
with a goal of reducing annualized sg a expense  we took several actions this year  including changing our corporate processes to reduce waste and increase speed 
we also took several actions to reduce expenses in the us and korea through early retirement programs 
there is more to be done in fiscal  but we accomplished the majority of what we set out to do in this area 
this should help improve operating margins when completed 
o reposition our global manufacturing footprint 
we announced the closure of four plants in higher cost areas of the world and announced plans to invest in four new plants in low cost countries  including expansion in china  mexico  hungary and india 
while there will be duplicative costs over the next two to three years as the process rolls out  when the process is completed  we will compete for new business from a much improved cost competitive position with increased asset utilization across the platform 
this process should benefit the company at both the gross and operating margin level and help us win incremental profitable business 
as part of this repositioning process  we also exited the taiwan operation of the electronics cooling business during fiscal which was an extremely competitive market with relatively low margins 
the decision to exit this business supports our repositioning plan toward improved operating margins as this business has historically generated operating losses 
o purchase and source from low cost countries 
early in fiscal modine sourced only percent of its materials  parts and equipment from low cost countries 
we now have the leadership and strategy in place to source up to percent of our needs from lower cost areas in  increasing to over percent in several years 
this is a critical element to the plan  as it s designed to improve our variable cost position over time 
o increased focus on technology development 
we announced several new technology developments and partnerships this year including o a new idle off system for heavy trucks which ensures comfort for resting drivers without requiring the engine to idle 
powered by a fuel cell auxiliary power unit  the system uses co air conditioning and heating systems  o a partnership with bloom energy through which we provide components for their stand alone fuel cell power generation modules  and o a second advanced steam methane reformer unit was installed in the us  built in collaboration with chevron technology ventures  llc and basf catalysts llc for fuel cell applications 
there are more innovations planned including advanced egr and waste heat recovery technologies 
o global vehicular product focus 
for many years  we have been internally organized by geographic region 
this has served us well  but as our customers grow globally  it became apparent that supporting our regional organization with one consistent  global product focus is critical to our future success 
while we continue to manage the business by geographic region  we are now supporting this regional structure with globally focused product groups comprised of engineers  marketing  sales and support people to provide consistency in our products across the regions 
our regional vehicular segments of original equipment americas  original equipment asia  and original equipment europe are now supported by the global product groups of engine products  powertrain cooling products  and passenger thermal management products 
this enhanced structure helps drive redundant costs out of our organization  and should drive incremental profitable growth 
o modine production system 
we also introduced the modine production system this year  which standardizes the processes and systems for each of our plants across the globe 
we are in the early stages of the process  but we ve already seen improvements in those plants that have implemented the changes 
not only does this help us better serve our global customer base  but it will benefit our variable cost position  by creating more manufacturing capacity with less capital investment 
segment information strategy  market conditions and trends on july   our aftermarket business  formerly reported within the distributed products segment  was spun off on a tax free basis and merged with transpro  inc transpro  which subsequently changed its name to proliance international  inc  was considered the acquirer of the aftermarket business 
our shareholders retained their modine common shares and  in the merger  received of a share of common stock of the newly combined company in exchange for each share of aftermarket common stock issued in the distribution 
subsequent to the merger  modine shareholders owned approximately percent of proliance international s common stock 
the aftermarket business has been presented as a discontinued operation for the periods presented in this report 
as a result of this merger and the elimination of the former distributed products segment  as well as recent organizational changes in regional vice president responsibilities  modine expanded its operating segments during fiscal from the three segments previously reported to five reportable segments  as follows original equipment americas  original equipment asia  original equipment europe  commercial hvac r and other 
we believe the expanded reporting segment structure reinforces the benefits of market  customer and geographic diversification and product breadth around our core business and technology platform in thermal management 
each of these segments is managed at the regional vice president level and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used in evaluating the performance of each business segment  and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily based on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
original equipment americas percent of fiscal revenues our original equipment americas segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made by commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers oems  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor home and motor coaches 
it also serves the north and south american automotive  heavy duty  and industrial markets  including agricultural  construction and industrial markets  ie lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
a factor with a significant impact on fiscal and anticipated fiscal year results is the pre build of us trucks in anticipation of higher emission standards required for diesel engine vehicles built after january  this presents both risks and opportunities 
while we experienced significant growth in truck volumes prior to january   the volume of trucks that will be built in the us will fall in calendar  as customers ordered more vehicles in anticipation of the change the components added to new vehicles increase the vehicle s cost and reduce its engine efficiency 
this anticipated volume decline had an impact on our consolidated results in the fourth quarter of fiscal and will impact fiscal the change in emissions standards also provides an opportunity for us  as more of our components are required on each vehicle to meet the new standards  thus our content per vehicle is increasing 
additionally  we have increased our share in this market as a result of new business wins 
our north american automotive business has experienced considerable deflationary price pressure from oems  while at the same time the cost of raw materials and purchased parts has increased 
our us competitors are financially challenged  with both dana corporation and delphi corporation filing for us chapter bankruptcy protection  creating additional deflationary price pressure and some excess capacity in the marketplace 
on the positive side of this trend  we have experienced increased opportunities to bid on business that was previously not available to us 
a positive trend in our north american and south american heavy duty and industrial businesses is increased emission standards for agricultural and construction equipment driving increased demand for our components such as egr coolers 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes several components 
first  our strategy is to reposition the segment  including reassessing our manufacturing footprint  improving sourcing of raw materials and purchased parts  and other programs intended to increase efficiency and right size capacity 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of four manufacturing facilities within this segment and acquired the remaining percent of modine brazil which we did not already own 
in addition  construction is currently underway for our new facility in nuevo laredo  mexico  which should be completed during late fiscal second  we are focused on reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth 
third  we are focused on pursuing only selected new business opportunities such as in the automotive business that will enable profitable growth to the company 
original equipment asia percent of fiscal revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing vehicular climate control systems  powertrain cooling systems and engine products to various industrial end markets  with the greatest percentage for commercial light truck applications 
these products are sold primarily to korean oems who export a significant portion of korean made vehicles to other countries 
our largest customers are hyundai motor company and kia motors corporation 
competitors include the halla group of visteon corporation  doowon climate control company ltd  samsung electronics  and others 
a significant trend in our asian business is our customers relative emphasis on lower price over better technology  evidenced by significant price reduction demands from hyundai motor and kia motors  our key customers 
on the upside  many parts that we have supplied as separate components are becoming part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy and focus in this business is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and focus on building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region in a more cost competitive manner 
construction is currently underway on our new manufacturing facilities in changzhou  china and chennai  india 
both facilities should be ready for production in late fiscal original equipment europe percent of fiscal revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems as well as vehicular climate control components to various industrial end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  heavy duty exhaust gas recycling products  retarder and transmission cooling components  and hvac condensers 
competitors include behr gmbh co 
kg  valeo  denso corporation  akg  and a variety of other companies 
the business experienced strong growth with its medium truck customers and construction machinery customers 
going forward  we expect to see a further consolidation of the customer base as well as a continuously developing emission legislation that will cause the need for more cooling products and other new products and systems 
trends affecting our european automotive business include significant price down demands from our european based customers  price competition from low cost country manufacturing locations  and material cost increases for aluminum  stainless steel and energy which have not been offset entirely by pass through agreements with our customers 
at the same time customer service expectations have increased 
to offset these difficult market conditions in the short term  we continue our focus on various lean manufacturing initiatives  low cost country sourcing and a critical review of all sg a related activities 
for mid and long term improvement we have recently initiated a program to assess our manufacturing footprint  with the announcement of adding capacity in hungary  where we already have one plant 
we believe there is an opportunity to be more cost competitive and grow our business at a higher rate if we expand our operations in lower cost geographic areas 
in addition we expect our european business to benefit from the output of our technology initiatives  which will contribute to establishing technological differentiation in the market place and thus provide leverage for new customer agreements 
the continued profitability of this business is dependent upon a further strengthening of our high technology and automated manufacturing environment  and therefore a lower manufacturing cost base 
in the interim  management is focused on process improvement in all areas and the implementation of favorable longer term customer agreements 
commercial heating  ventilating and air conditioning equipment  and refrigeration hvac r percent of fiscal revenues our commercial hvac r business provides a variety of niche products in north america  europe  asia and south africa that are used by engineers  contractors and building owners in applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
we manufacture coils copper tube aluminum fin coils and all aluminum microchannel coils for heating  refrigeration  air conditioning and vehicular applications 
we also manufacture heating products for commercial applications  including gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  high and low intensity infrared and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products for commercial applications include single packaged vertical units and vertical unit ventilators used in school room applications  computer room air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers and roof top cooling units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
competitors include lennox international heatcraft refrigeration products  eco  thomas betts reznor  mestek inc sterling  emerson electric company liebert hiross  united technologies corporation carrier and johnson controls  inc york 
revenues have increased primarily due to the acquisition of airedale in fiscal however  the segment has grown organically as well  due to growth in coil sales 
margins in this business have been negatively affected by increased commodity costs a trend which is expected to continue 
economic conditions  such as demand for new construction  are drivers of demand for the heating and cooling products 
other percent of fiscal revenues the other segment is partially comprised of our fuel cell business 
this business is a developmental stage enterprise supporting the highly complex thermal management needs of fuel cell systems 
these fuel cell systems are used in stationary power applications  vehicle engine applications  and hydrogen fuel processing 
as macro economic trends have shifted causing increased development of alternatives to oil based fuel  we have intensified our activity in this business 
during fiscal we worked with our partner  bloom energy  to provide components for their early stage prototype stationery power units that should be commercially available in the next several years 
we view stationery power units as a potentially significant long term growth driver for the company due to increased global demand for fuel cell technology  driven by demand for a sustainable  environmentally sound and independent means of power 
we are not aware of any competitor of ours that has the same level of focus on this market 
this segment also includes our electronics cooling business which develops and manufactures custom thermal management solutions for the electronics market worldwide 
on may   we announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives for this business 
the business includes facilities located in north america and the united kingdom 
we offer customers global design and manufacturing support 
our broad product offering includes heat pipes round  flat bent  and vapor chambers  heat pipe assemblies embedded and remote  heat sinks  cold plates  heat exchangers liquid to air and air to air  liquid cooling systems  and advanced technologies such as loop heat pipes 
we serve a diversified set of markets and industries that include high performance computing server storage embedded  communications  power  military aerospace  medical  automotive  and transportation 
the markets we serve are expected to grow at a mid single digit compounded annual growth rate 
these trends are favorable because the thermal requirements of the end product continue to drive greater demand for heat pipes  heat pipe assemblies  and other advanced solutions 
outlook the challenging market factors that existed during fiscal are anticipated to continue to significantly impact the business into fiscal  including ongoing raw material cost increases  as well as continued pressure from vehicular customers for product price reductions 
fiscal will be positively impacted by a strong line up of new business programs  the volume benefit from a new truck customer in the us  and the accretive acquisitions of modine brazil in may and airedale in may these positive factors will be partially offset by lower truck build rates in the us subsequent to the january  emissions standards change 
we also anticipate continued challenges through aggressive competition  a potentially softer korean economy  and reduced volumes for certain automotive vehicle platforms 
based on the factors noted above  we are projecting fiscal sales to decrease from fiscal to a range of billion to billion 
however  we are expecting gross margins to improve from percent in fiscal to a range of percent to percent in fiscal  and operating margin to improve from percent in fiscal to a range of percent to percent in fiscal these improvements are driven by the expected realization of benefits related to our repositioning plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in our business 
with the expected decline in revenues  offset by the anticipated improvements in gross margin and operating margin  we are projecting a similar to improved level of pre tax results in fiscal in a range of million to million 
we should also experience an increased tax rate from a tax benefit of percent in fiscal to a tax provision in a range of percent to percent in fiscal due to the absence of tax benefits like those realized in fiscal brazil net operating loss  worthless stock deduction  and r d credit 
based on the above factors  we expect fiscal earnings from continuing operations to fall within a range of to per fully diluted share 
as we move to bring several new plants online  our capital expenditures should increase to a range of million to million 
we also expect depreciation to increase to a range of million to million 
in fiscal and beyond  we intend to remain focused on our strategies of developing new products and technologies  expanding into new markets and geographies and reducing our costs 
these strategies and actions will make us a more cost competitive  innovative and efficient technology provider to our current and future customers 
we will continue our repositioning efforts with a goal of making the company more efficient 
we are implementing programs to change our manufacturing footprint  reduce our fixed and variable cost structure and standardize our manufacturing processes and global product offering 
consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal revenues were a record billion  representing an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal the growth in revenues was primarily related to acquired revenues from the may modine brazil acquisition 
in addition to acquired revenues  the fiscal growth in revenues was driven by strength in global truck and off highway markets 
earnings from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily offset by higher commodity prices  additional customer pricing pressures and increased selling  general and administrative sg a expenses including repositioning and restructuring charges 
partially offsetting these increased costs was a decrease in the effective income tax rate based on favorable tax planning strategies completed during the year 
in september  we elected early adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
this literature provides guidance on how to quantify the effects of prior year misstatements 
when we made this election  four misstatements existed that were immaterial individually and in the aggregate to all fiscal years prior to fiscal accordingly  we elected to record the effects of applying sab no 
using the cumulative effect transition method  which resulted in a million adjustment to beginning retained earnings at april  to correct these errors 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the adoption of sab no 
the following table presents consolidated results from continuing operations on a comparative basis for the years ended march   and years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges income from operations interest expense other income net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was driven by million of acquired revenues related to the may acquisition of modine brazil  million related to favorable impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates and million of organic growth 
organic revenues were driven by strength in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets 
strong sales in the european automotive  north american truck and global heavy duty markets were offset by moderate declines in the north american automotive market  based on continued softness experienced in the market and overall price down pressures reducing sales prices per unit 
gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily driven by higher global commodity pricing and customer price decreases experienced during the fiscal year 
gross margin decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the primary contributing factor to the decline in gross margin has been the steady increase in raw material prices experienced which started during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and continued through fiscal the most significant commodities used in our manufacturing process are aluminum  copper and nickel 
aluminum prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal  and copper prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal nickel has experienced a percent increase on average from fiscal to fiscal which resulted in considerably more cost to the company 
we have agreements with certain customers to pass through these higher commodity prices to them in our sales price  however  these pass through agreements can lag up to one year behind the actual price increases  or may not provide us the ability to recover the entire material price increase 
these commodity price increases were the primary factor contributing to the decrease in gross margin  as the material component of cost of sales increased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal in addition  repositioning costs of million were recorded in gross profit during the fiscal year  as the company continues to reposition its manufacturing footprint 
sg a expenses and restructuring charges increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in sg a was related to the acquisition of modine brazil in may the remaining increase in sg a was primarily driven by million of repositioning costs recorded during fiscal the decrease in gross profit combined with the increase in sg a expenses contributed to the million decrease in operating income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate achieved in conjunction with refinancing activities completed during the fiscal year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance the modine brazil acquisition of million and the share repurchase program of million 
other income increased million from fiscal to fiscal this increase is primarily due to a purchase price settlement of million received during fiscal relating to the fiscal acquisition of winiamando s automotive climate control division 
this is partially offset by the reduction in equity earnings of non consolidated joint ventures due to the may acquisition of the remaining percent of modine brazil 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or percent  to a benefit of million in fiscal from a provision of million in fiscal in addition  the effective income tax rate decreased to a benefit of percent in fiscal from a provision of percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was related to a million benefit from net operating losses in brazil that were previously unavailable prior to the acquisition of modine brazil  a million benefit from the determination that our investment in the taiwan business had become worthless and a tax benefit of million from a research and development tax credit which was extended 
the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the brazil net operating loss benefit  worthless stock benefit and research and development credit discussed above  as well as the impact of various state and foreign income taxes 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was driven by acquisitions as well as growth in organic revenues 
acquired revenues included million related to the may acquisition of airedale  million related to the march modine jackson acquisition  and million related to the july acquisition of modine korea 
organic revenues increased million  driven by strength in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets 
revenues in worldwide heavy duty and industrial markets increased million  as construction and agricultural market demand continued to remain strong during fiscal revenues in us truck markets increased million  related to strong volumes and pre buy activity in anticipation of higher us emissions standards implemented on january  automotive volumes remained relatively consistent year over year  as slight growth in european markets was offset by moderate declines in us markets  based on continued softness experienced in these markets and price down pressures reducing sales prices per unit 
organic commercial hvac r revenues increased modestly  driven by strong coil and condenser sales  especially within the southeastern portion of the us gross profit increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily driven by the growth in sales volume during fiscal  partially offset by material price increases 
despite the increase in gross profit  gross margin decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the primary contributing factor to the decline in gross margin has been the steady increase in raw material prices experienced during fiscal  especially during the third and fourth quarters 
the most significant commodities used in our manufacturing process are aluminum and copper  with aluminum prices increasing percent on average from fiscal to fiscal  and copper prices increasing percent on average from fiscal to fiscal we have agreements with certain customers to pass through these higher commodity prices to them in our sales price  however  these pass through agreements can lag up to one year behind the actual price increases  or may not provide us the ability to recover the entire material price increase 
these commodity price increases were the primary factor contributing to the decrease in gross margin  as the material component of cost of sales increased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal in addition  the decline in gross margin is related to a million property  plant and equipment impairment charge recorded during fiscal within the taiwan operation of the electronics cooling business  and a million charge related to an early retirement program initiated in our korean operation during fiscal sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in sg a was related to the acquired businesses in fiscal and the remaining increase in sg a was driven by higher salaries and other compensation related to headcount increases  a million charge related to the korean early retirement program initiated during fiscal  as well as incremental professional services incurred in conjunction with certain market studies  tax projects  and other process improvement activities 
the increase in gross profit  offset by the increase in sg a expenses  contributed to the million decrease in operating income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal  related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate achieved in conjunction with refinancing activities completed during the fiscal year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance the airedale acquisition million and the share repurchase program million 
other income decreased million from fiscal to fiscal this decrease is primarily comprised of a reduction in equity earnings of non consolidated joint ventures and a reduction in foreign currency transaction gains based on differences in foreign currency exchange rates and transactions between fiscal and fiscal these decreases are partially offset by increases in interest income and a million settlement gain recorded during fiscal related to the korean acquisition 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition  the effective income tax rate decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was related to a million research and development tax credit recorded during fiscal  partially offset by million of income tax expense recorded during the year in conjunction with million of cash repatriated to the us from a foreign location under the american jobs creation act of the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the research and development credit and tax on repatriation discussed above  as well as the impact of various state and foreign income taxes 
discontinued operations on july   the company completed the spin off of its aftermarket business on a debt free and tax free basis to its shareholders and the immediate merger of the spun off business into transpro 
the aftermarket business  which was a part of the former distributed products segment  has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company recorded  as a result of the spin off transaction  a non cash charge to earnings of million  representing the difference between the value modine shareholders received in the new company of million  a function of the stock price of transpro at the closing  and the million in asset carrying value of modine s aftermarket business  and million of foreign currency translation loss recognized at the date of the transaction 
the net assets spun off in the transaction were primarily comprised of inventory  accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment 
as a result of the discontinued operations presentation  the net earnings loss related to the discontinued operations of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  has been separately presented in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of earnings loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes 
segment results of operations original equipment americas years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges income from operations net sales within the original equipment americas segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal  and increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal continued sales growth experienced in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets over the years presented contributed to this growth 
these strong volumes are attributable to strength in the truck  agriculture and construction markets  as well as high pre buy activity in anticipation of the january  emission regulations primarily within the truck market 
in addition  the march modine jackson acquisition contributed million toward the fiscal growth in net sales  and the may modine brazil acquisition contributed million toward the fiscal growth in sales 
these increased volumes were partially offset in fiscal and more than offset in fiscal by reduced sales in the automotive market  as several automakers have gone through inventory corrections  in part triggered by higher gas prices and a consumer shift from light trucks and full suv s to cars and small suv s 
gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal  and decreased further to percent in fiscal this deterioration in gross margin has been driven by the increasing raw material costs over the years presented  as well as continued pricing pressures placed on us by the oems in these markets 
in order to minimize these trends  the company is pursuing a number of action items  including review of foreign suppliers and low cost sourcing of purchases  hedging strategies for commodity prices  and review of our pass through agreements with our customers 
sg a expenses have held relatively consistent as a percentage of sales within this segment from fiscal to fiscal the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to million of restructuring costs incurred  primarily from employee severance  in conjunction with announced plant closures in this segment during fiscal income from operations decreased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  primarily driven by the decline in gross margin related to commodity price increases and customer pricing pressures 
original equipment asia years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses loss income from operations modine korea was acquired by the company in july  with seven months of results included in fiscal modine korea s sales were positively impacted by exchange rate changes of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  but remained relatively consistent on a local currency basis 
this increase in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes as a result of general softness experienced in the korean economy early in fiscal coupled with a strike at a customer facility 
gross margin has decreased from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal weak sales volumes resulting from the strike at a customer facility  as well as customer pricing pressures  are the primary factors driving this decrease 
sg a expenses were relatively consistent as a percentage of sales for fiscal and fiscal the increase to percent in fiscal is related to an early retirement program which resulted in a million charge recorded during the year 
this early retirement charge contributed to the reduction in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal loss from operations is consistent from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the customer pricing pressures and strike activity discussed above 
original equipment europe years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net sales within the original equipment europe segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal primarily from growth in the heavy duty and automotive markets 
this growth was negatively impacted by exchange rate changes of million during fiscal during fiscal  the million  or percent increase in net sales was primarily driven by growth in the heavy duty market  which continued to show strength similar to the prior year 
automotive sales increased in fiscal  but at a much slower pace than that experienced in the prior year 
the european automotive market is showing signs of increased competitive pressures and price down pressures from customers  which contributed to the slowing growth in these markets during fiscal exchange rate changes of million had a positive impact on net sales in fiscal gross profit increased correspondingly to the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal  but declined from fiscal to fiscal gross margin held consistent at percent in fiscal and and decreased to percent in fiscal this reduced gross profit and margin in fiscal is related to the high commodity prices and certain warranty issues experienced during fiscal  as well as customer pricing pressures by the oem s 
these pricing pressures started during fiscal and accelerated in fiscal the gross margin decrease was partially offset by operating efficiencies that focused on plant performance and cost reductions 
sg a expenses were consistent over the past three years on a larger sales base  resulting in a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales within this segment 
this improvement in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales is the result of on going reduction efforts 
commercial hvac r years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net sales within the commercial hvac r segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal  and increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal the majority of the fiscal increase was related to the airedale acquisition that contributed million of incremental sales 
in addition  strong coil and condenser sales  especially in southeastern portions of the us related to hurricane katrina  also contributed to the fiscal increase in net sales 
the fiscal increase in net sales is primarily related to growing air conditioning sales in the us as the airedale product was further expanded into this market during fiscal gross margin decreased over the past few years from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal lower gross margin earned in the newly acquired airedale operations was the primary factor leading to the decline in the gross margin from fiscal to fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the changing mix of products within this segment toward lower margin air conditioning products 
modest commodity pricing pressures for certain component products have also contributed to the reduction in gross margin over the past two years 
sg a expenses increased million from fiscal to fiscal  primarily driven by incremental sg a expenditures absorbed in the airedale acquisition 
the slight increase in sg a in fiscal is related to integration inefficiencies  as the us airedale business was transferred into the existing north american facilities during the year 
sg a expenses are relatively consistent in fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of sales 
other years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses loss from operations the other segment is comprised of the electronics cooling business and the fuel cell business 
the reduction in sales  gross profit and income from operations from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by weaknesses experienced in the electronics cooling market 
the north american and united kingdom electronics cooling markets experienced stronger sales in fiscal which contributed to the increase of million  or percent  in net sales 
in addition  our fuel cell business increased the development and delivery of prototype fuel cell heat exchange products 
during fiscal  an impairment charge of million was recorded within this segment related to the taiwan operation of the electronics cooling business given the operating losses and market pressures impacting this business 
the taiwan facility was closed during fiscal with operations ceasing in july the million of costs incurred related to the taiwan closure were largely offset by the positive impact of closing the taiwan facility  as this business has historically operated with losses 
on may   we announced that we will explore strategic alternatives for our electronics cooling business 
this review could result in several scenarios  including the sale of the business at a price and on terms that would represent a better value for modine s shareholders than having the business continue to operate as a modine subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under lines of credit provided by banks in the united states and abroad

cash decreased million to million at fiscal year end 
the ratio of modine s total debt to capital was percent at the end of fiscal compared to percent at the end of fiscal total debt increased million to million  due in large part to the million modine brazil acquisition and the million the company spent on repurchasing its stock  which is comprised of million acquired through stock repurchase programs and million of treasury stock acquisitions 
other key programs funded during the fiscal year were dividends totaling million and capital expenditures of million 
these programs were financed by a drawdown of surplus cash and the use of existing lines of credit

research and development in fiscal  modine increased its research and development r d spending by percent to million from million one year ago 
investment in r d has increased at an average annual rate of approximately percent since fiscal the company s r d efforts have been focused on new products and technologies to respond to market trends due to environmental legislation as well as to enhance energy efficiency and fuel economy 
these key market drivers are shaping and influencing our customers future thermal management needs 
legislation on nox and particulate emissions for diesel engines continues to provide market opportunities for modine through products such as egr s 
many new heat exchanger and cooling module platforms have been developed in order to help our customers comply with this legislation 
likewise  concern over global warming is continuing to cause the industry to consider replacing current refrigerants such as r a with new  environmentally friendly refrigerants such as co a newly formed hvac group has grown out of the r d area 
knowledge developed from r d activities will be used to develop improved hvac product platforms  including products to comply with potential anti idling legislation for heavy duty vehicles 
energy efficiency legislation is also driving opportunities for high performance  lightweight heat exchangers in commercial markets 
modine continues to refine the product development process for all of its markets  including the use of virtual simulation to increase efficiency and reduce time to market with new designs 
modine ended the year with  worldwide patents  an increase of patents over the prior year 
modine is focused on the long term commercialization of our intellectual property and research  and believes that these investments will result in new and next generation products and technologies 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine s financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
in certain situations  the price increases are recognized as revenue at the time products are shipped in accordance with the contractual arrangements with our customer  but are offset by appropriate provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected 
these provisions are established based on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
at march   we had established of provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected as the likelihood of collection is uncertain 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including amortized intangibles  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to fair market value based on a discounted cash flow approach and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other factors indicate a need to perform the testing more often 
the company conducts its annual review of goodwill for impairment in the third quarter 
the recoverability of goodwill was determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income were considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
the estimated cash flows assume an improvement in future years 
to the extent that future cash flows do not improve  certain portions of our goodwill balance could become impaired 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 
tooling costs pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over the program life or three years  whichever is shorter  and recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
no significant arrangements existed during the years ended march  and where customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 
pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine s pension and postretirement plans are dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  rate of compensation increase  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in health care costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  in addition  the modine salaried employee pension plan was modified so that no service performed after march  will be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula 
at the current pension assumption rates  we would expect pension expense to decline steadily going forward 
we believe the defined contribution plan will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses covered by the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and fiscal was percent 
for fiscal  the company has assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of december for fiscal  the company will use a discount rate of percent  reflecting an increase from percent in fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the health care cost trend rate 
the health care trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company expects this to decline to percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree health care and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
furthermore  beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
a one percent increase in the health care trend rate would result in an increase in postretirement expense of approximately  and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate would result in an increase in benefit expense of approximately other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of certain contingencies and litigation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  economic risk and commodity price risk 
foreign currency risk modine is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign countries 
modine has manufacturing facilities in brazil  china  mexico  south africa  south korea  and throughout europe 
it also has equity investments in companies located in france  japan  and china 
modine sells and distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures  distributes and sells it products 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  changes between the dollar and the south korean won and changes between the dollar and the brazilian real 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the company s foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s favorable unfavorable currency translation adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
as of march  and  the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities

this collar was settled on august  for a loss of million 
on august   the company entered into a new zero cost collar to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the entire outstanding amount of the modine korea  llc loan

interest rate risk modine s interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
the company generally utilizes a mixture of debt maturities together with both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings 
on october   the company entered into two forward starting swaps in anticipation of the million private placement debt offering which occurred on december  these swaps were entered into to eliminate the variability in interest rates prior to locking the fixed interest rate for the private placement offering 
on november   the fixed interest rate of the private placement borrowing was locked and  accordingly  the swaps were settled at a loss of million

after credit is granted the company actively monitors the customer s financial condition and developing business news 
approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated in the company s top customers 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
for example  traditionally  significant increases in oil prices have had an adverse effect on many markets the company serves 
continued high oil prices may negatively impact the company s earnings  particularly in the truck and off highway markets 
with respect to international instability  the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
during fiscal there was an overall weakening of the us dollar 
the euro and won strengthened against the dollar by percent and percent  respectively 
the brazilian real remained essentially unchanged in fiscal  but strengthened by percent in fiscal the chinese renminbi strengthened almost percent against the us dollar in fiscal and was rather flat in fiscal as modine expands its global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 
the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to exhaust gas recirculation  co and fuel cell technology 
modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets emerge 
the upturn in the economy and continued economic growth in china are putting production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of steel and aluminum fin stock serving a more robust market 
as a result  some suppliers are allocating product among customers  extending lead times or holding supply to the prior year s level 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
historically high commodity pricing  which includes aluminum  copper and nickel  is making it increasingly difficult to pass along the full amount of these increases to our customers as our contracts have provided for in the past 
beside the purchase of raw materials  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in many instances  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier of such parts being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company offsets this risk with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible but these agreements generally carry annual price down provisions as well 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any one or more of the markets it serves  or a reduction in the company s participation in any one or more markets 
however  the risks associated with any market downturn or reduction are still substantial 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper and aluminum alloy  and natural gas 
in fiscal  the company entered into fixed price contracts to hedge against changes in aluminum and natural gas 
in fiscal  the company is evaluating its other heavily used commodities and expects to adopt hedging strategies  where prudent  for these commodities to assist in protecting the company from continued gross margin erosion 
the company does maintain agreements with certain oem customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fluctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a quarter or longer 
because of the historic highs reached in some commodities  the company is dealing with increasing challenges from oem customers to abide by these agreements and pay the full amount of the price increases 
hedging and foreign currency exchange contracts the company uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
their use is restricted primarily to hedging assets and obligations already held by modine  and they are used to protect cash flows rather than generate income or engage in speculative activity 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives during fiscal  the company entered into futures contracts related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of aluminum and natural gas 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchase of these commodities 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges by the company 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and natural gas impact earnings 
during the year ended march   million of income was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
at march   million of unrealized gains remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next three months 
foreign exchange contracts modine maintains a foreign exchange risk management strategy that uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
modine periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
generally  these contracts have terms of or fewer days 
the effect of this practice is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on modine s earnings 
modine s foreign currency exchange contracts do not subject it to significant risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
as of march   the company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts  with the exception of the zero cost collar to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the entire amount of the modine korea  llc loan which is discussed above under the section entitled foreign currency risk 
non us dollar financing transactions through intercompany loans or local borrowings in the corresponding currency generally are effective as hedges of long term investments 
the company has a number of investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and non consolidated foreign joint ventures 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility 
in certain instances  the company uses non derivative financial instruments to hedge  or offset  this exposure 
the currency exposure related to the net assets of modine s european subsidiaries has been managed partially through euro denominated debt agreements entered into by the parent 
as of march   there were no outstanding euro denominated borrowings 
interest rate derivative as further noted above under the section entitled interest rate risk  the company entered into a two forward starting swaps in anticipation of the million private placement debt offering that occurred on december  the forward starting swaps were treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
on november   the fixed interest rate of the private placement borrowing was locked and  accordingly  the company terminated and settled the forward starting swaps at a loss of million 
the million loss is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes of million  and is being amortized to interest expense over the respective eleven and twelve year lives of the debt offerings
