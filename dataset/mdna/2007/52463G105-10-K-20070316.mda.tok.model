overview legacy bancorp  inc reported a net loss of  or per diluted share for the quarter ended december   and net income of million for the twelve months ended december  the fourth quarter loss is primarily a result of a partial balance sheet restructuring through the sale of approximately million of bonds which were yielding an average of 
the company incurred an after tax loss of 
table of contents approximately million on the sale of these bonds 
proceeds from the sale were reinvested in securities averaging  and the transaction is expected to increase interest income by approximately million in furthermore  the company incurred an additional  in tax expense in the fourth quarter of as a result of a reevaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax benefit resulting from the contribution of  shares of common stock to the legacy banks foundation the foundation in these non core items were partially offset by a gain of  on the termination of the bank s defined benefit plan in the fourth quarter of the total shares outstanding resulted in a book value per share and tangible book value per share of and  respectively  at december  dividend on march  the company announced that its board of directors had declared a cash dividend of per common share

table of contents growth strategy and challenges long term growth is an essential element in our business plan 
lending is the major driver of revenue and we are committed to supporting our loan growth 
we recognize that loan and deposit growth are interdependent  and over the long term both must grow consistently 
one of our biggest challenges is to grow our customer base and to grow the depth and breadth of our customer relationships 
we address this challenge by maintaining our focus on anticipating  understanding and assisting our customers in achieving their financial goals 
our deposit pricing strategy is two fold 
first  our lifepath product is important to our deposit mix 
it requires customers to maintain a checking account as part of the relationship  the goal being to create multiple relationships with our customers to aid both profitability and customer retention 
the lifepath savings product is structured and priced like a money market deposit or fund  except that it does not offer check writing 
lifepath deposits amounted to million as of december  our experience with money market type deposit accounts has been that they become a long term  stable funding source at reasonable cost 
the second component in our pricing strategy is to continuously offer a selection of special certificates of deposit with competitive interest rates that are tiered to the amount of the customer deposits 
another challenge is being able to maintain sufficient asset size or scale to provide the marketing  technology  service and other support functions so that we will continue to be relevant and competitive 
it is for these reasons that management emphasizes and monitors growth in terms of customers  customer households  customer relationships  assets  revenue per employee  and efficiency 
we also know that to successfully grow  our employees must be extremely well trained and experienced 
we regularly monitor training hours per employee  employee turnover and employee and customer satisfaction surveys 
we also engage a mystery shopping firm that sends representatives into each of our locations to experience and witness what the customer experiences and then provide us with constructive feedback 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on a periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business of legacy bancorp and subsidiaries asset quality 
income taxes legacy bancorp uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets applicable to capital loss carryforwards of   of which expires in  and  of which expires in  are recoverable only to the extent that capital gains can be realized during the carryforward period 
the judgments applied by management consider the likelihood that capital gain income will be realized within the carryforward period in light of our tax planning strategies and changes in market conditions 
as of december  a valuation allowance of  was established against deferred tax assets related to the uncertain utilization of the charitable contribution carryforward created primarily by the donation to the legacy banks 
table of contents foundation as part of the conversion 
this allowance was increased by  to million as of december   reflecting additional uncertainty of the utilization of the carryforward 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that management considers to be critical  however all accounting policies are important  and therefore you are encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to gain a better understanding of how our financial performance is measured and reported 
net interest income legacy bancorp s results of operations  or net income  are dependent mainly on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and interest expense incurred on its deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income represented and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net interest margin was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the overall interest rate environment and changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income 
we utilize a rigorous asset and liability management process to manage interest rate risk 
we monitor the interest rate environment and set interest rates on our deposit and loan products to effectively manage interest rate risk 
to this end  we are aided by a quarterly review of critical assumptions  modeling projections  back testing of the model s previous projections against actual results  analysis of changes  opportunities and risks associated with changes in market interest rates  and liquidity analysis 
for a more detailed description of our asset and liability management process  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management management of market risk 
non interest expense legacy bancorp s non interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy  technology  marketing  general administrative expenses and income tax expense 
we use the efficiency ratio non interest expense for the period minus expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets divided by the sum of net interest income before the loan loss provision plus non interest income and the expense ratio non interest expense to total average assets as the primary measurements to monitor and control non interest expense 
for the year ended december   the efficiency and expense ratios were and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the efficiency and expense ratios were and  respectively 
the decrease in both ratios was primarily a result of the non core expense items occurring in the fourth quarter of  including the donation of company stock to the legacy banks foundation 
net income return on average assets roaa is a primary measurement of net income relative to peer banks 
it has been low in recent years relative to peer banks  but has shown improvement from through in  the roaa was negative  as expected  primarily as a result of the contribution to the foundation as part of the mutual to stock conversion 
in  the roaa was significantly impacted by the increase in operating expenses and pressure on the net interest margin due to the flat to partially inverted yield curve for much of the year 
for the years ended december  and the roaa was and  respectively 
in addition to net interest income and non interest expense  results of operations are also affected by fee income from banking and non banking operations  provisions for loan losses  gains losses on sales of loans and securities available for sale  loan servicing income and other miscellaneous income 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets total assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was largely the result of loan growth as described below 
cash and short term investments overall  cash and short term investments increased by million  or 
cash and correspondent bank balances decreased by million  or to million as of december  compared to million at december  over the same period  short term investments  comprised of federal funds sold and fhlb overnight deposits  increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december   mainly due to the receipt of funds on the last day of the year 
securities our investment portfolio aggregated million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  this decrease was primarily related some security cash flow being used to fund loan growth  as well as the partial balance sheet restructuring undertaken at the 
table of contents end of where the bank sold approximately million of bonds which were yielding an average of and incurred an after tax loss of approximately million  or per share  on this sale 
proceeds from the sale were reinvested in securities averaging  and the transaction is expected to increase interest income by approximately million in net loans net loans as of december  were million  an increase of million  or  over net loan balances of million as of december  in particular  residential mortgage balances increased by million  or to million  and the commercial real estate loan balances  including both loans within our market area as well as national commercial real estate loans increased million  or to million 
the company opened a loan production office in colonie  new york in the third quarter of as part of its committed to the further expansion of its commercial lending business over the next several years 
deposits deposit growth continued in as deposits increased by million to million at december   an increase of over a balance of million at december  the largest increases came in certificates of deposit which increased by million and lifepath savings accounts which increased by million 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in regular savings  now accounts and certain demand accounts 
the deposit increases overall were the result of the bank s continued marketing and promotional efforts in its market area  including the promotion of cd specials 
borrowed funds the company relies on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb as an additional funding source as liquidity needs dictate 
the balance of these borrowings will fluctuate depending on the bank s ability to grow deposits as well as the amount of loan demand in the market 
funds borrowed from the fhlbb decreased by million  or to million at december  from a balance of million as of december  the overall decline was primarily a result of the bank success in growing deposits  as described above 
retained earnings retained earnings increased by million to million at december   an increase of from a balance of million as of december  this increase was driven primarily by a contribution of million from net income  as well as a decrease of million in the unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities  primarily due to the restructuring of this portfolio  as previously discussed 
these increases to equity were offset somewhat by the payment of four separate dividends of  each 
stockholders equity was also impacted by the release of  shares of common stock within the company s esop 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management recognizes that taking and managing risk is fundamental to the business of banking 
through the development  implementation and monitoring of its policies with respect to risk management  the bank strives to measure  evaluate and control the risks it faces 
management understands that an effective risk management system is critical to the safety and soundness of the bank 
chief among the risks faced by legacy banks are credit risk  market risk including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  operational transaction risk and compliance risk 
within management  the responsibility for risk management rests with the risk management department  headed by the vice president and general counsel  other members of the department  and the senior officers responsible for lending  retail banking and human resources 
the risk management department continually reviews the status of our risk management efforts  including reviews of internal and external audit findings  loan review findings  and the activities of the asset liability committee with respect to monitoring interest rate and liquidity risk 
the committee tracks any open items requiring corrective action with the goal of ensuring that each is addressed on a timely basis 
the vice president and general counsel reports all findings of the risk management department directly to the audit committee of the bank 
management of credit risk legacy banks considers credit risk to be the most significant risk it faces  in that it has the greatest potential to affect the financial condition and operating results of legacy banks 
credit risk is managed through a combination of policies established by the board of directors of the bank  the monitoring of compliance with these policies  and the periodic evaluation of loans in the portfolio  including those with problem characteristics 
in general  the bank s policies establish maximums on the amount of credit that may be granted to a single borrower including affiliates  the aggregate amount of loans outstanding by type in relation to total assets and capital  and loan concentrations 
collateral and debt service coverage ratios  approval limits and other underwriting criteria are also specified 
policies also exist with respect to performing periodic credit reviews  the rating of loans  when loans should be placed on non performing status and factors that should be considered in establishing the bank s allowance for loan losses 
management of market risk market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates  and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
the bank has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements 
because net interest income is the bank s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which the bank is exposed 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the bank s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level and duration of the bank s assets and liabilities 
over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income  changes in rates may also affect the volume of lending activity  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings  the flow and mix of deposits  and the market value of the bank s assets and liabilities 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the bank through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  primarily deposits  borrowings  loans and securities  coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given the bank s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy and performance objectives 
through such management  the bank seeks to manage the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 

table of contents strategies used by the bank to manage the potential volatility of its earnings may include emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans  variable rate commercial loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit  investing in securities with relatively short maturities and or expected average lives  classifying nearly all of the investment portfolio as available for sale in order to provide for flexibility in liquidity management  and lengthening liabilities such as certificates of deposits and federal home loan bank of boston borrowings when appropriate 
legacy banks asset liability committee  comprised of several members of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the committee reviews with the board of directors its analysis of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk  the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the bank s future net interest income  its strategies and other activities  and the effect of those strategies on the bank s operating results 
the committee is also actively involved in the bank s planning and budgeting process as well as in determining pricing strategies for deposits and loans 
the committee s primary method for measuring and evaluating interest rate risk is income simulation analysis 
this analysis considers the maturity and interest rate repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios 
interest rate scenarios tested generally include parallel and flattening steepening rate changes over a one year period  and static or flat rates 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over specified time horizon  usually one and two year periods 
the simulations also show the net interest income volatility for up to five years 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the estimated changes in the bank s net interest income that would result from the designated twelve month changes in the us treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit run off  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
percentage change in estimated net interest income over months as compared to flat rates basis point parallel increase in rates basis point parallel increase in rates flat interest rates basis point parallel decrease in rates basis point steepening decrease in rates as indicated in the table above  the result of a basis point parallel increase in interest rates is estimated to decrease net interest income by over a month horizon  when compared to the flat rate scenario 
for a basis point parallel increase in the level of interest rates  net interest income is estimated to decline by over a month horizon  when compared against the flat rate scenario 
inherent in these estimates is the assumption that certain transaction and savings account deposit rates would not increase while certain money market and lifepath accounts would increase by to basis points for each basis point increase in market interest rates 
these assumptions are based on the bank s past experience with the changes in rates paid on these non maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates 
the estimated change in net interest income from the flat rate scenario for a basis point parallel decline in the level of interest rates is an increase of  which assumes little  if any  decrease in savings and interest bearing checking rates  and an average decrease of to basis points in money market and lifepath rates  respectively  for each basis point decrease in market interest rates 
for a basis point steepening decrease the shorter end of the yield curve decreasing more than the longer end in the level of interest rates  net interest 
table of contents income is estimated to increase by over a month horizon  when compared against the flat rate scenario 
effectively  in the declining interest rate scenario  legacy banks begins to reap some potential benefit of lower rates because the rates on its core deposit accounts decrease somewhat faster than the rates on interest earning assets 
this simulation also incorporates the assumption that shorter term fhlbb borrowings at december  are replaced mainly with borrowings with maturities averaging years 
there are inherent shortcomings in income simulation  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis 
the assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits eg checking react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and mortgage backed securities  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and the volume of other deposit flows 
as such  although the analysis shown above provides an indication of the bank s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
in its management of interest rate risk  the bank also relies on the analysis of its interest rate gap  which is the measure of the mismatch between the amount of legacy s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within specified timeframes 
an asset sensitive position positive gap exists when there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a particular time horizon  and generally signifies a favorable effect on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates and a negative effect during periods of falling interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position negative gap would generally indicate a negative effect on net interest income during periods of rising rates and a positive effect during periods of falling rates 
certain factors may serve to limit the usefulness of the measurement of the interest rate gap 
for example  interest rates on certain assets and liabilities are discretionary and may change in advance of  or may lag behind  changes in market rates 
the gap analysis does not give effect to changes legacy may undertake to mitigate interest rate risk 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that may restrict the magnitude of changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the gap analysis 
lastly  should interest rates increase  the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk  or the risk to earnings and capital arising from an organization s inability to meet its obligations without incurring unacceptable losses  is managed by the bank s chief financial officer  who monitors on a daily basis the adequacy of the bank s liquidity position 
oversight is provided by the asset liability committee  which reviews the bank s liquidity on a weekly basis  and by the board of directors of the bank  which reviews the adequacy of our liquidity resources on a monthly basis 
our primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled payments from amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we maintain excess funds in cash and short term interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity

we also rely on outside borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston  as an additional funding source

since december   legacy has decreased federal home loan bank of boston borrowings by million to a total of million outstanding as of december  on that date  we had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of boston 
as described within this report  the bank intends to grow its loan assets 
the cash flow required to fund those potential increases in loans will likely be provided primarily by increases in deposits  as we implement our strategy to expand our franchise geographically and to increase our deposit market share in the areas served by the bank at

to the extent that cash flow provided by our deposit gathering efforts does not completely fund increases in assets  we will likely borrow funds from the fhlbb to provide the necessary cash flow 
the capital necessary to support future growth in assets is anticipated to be provided by our capital resources in hand  augmented over time by increases from net income  net of dividends paid  if any

table of contents management of other risks two additional risk areas that receive significant attention by management and the board are operational risk and compliance risk 
operational risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from control deficiencies  problems with information systems  fraud  error or unforeseen catastrophes 
compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of  or nonconformance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  internal policies and procedures or ethical standards 
compliance risk can expose us to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages and the voiding of contracts 
the bank addresses such risks through the establishment of comprehensive policies and procedures with respect to internal control  the management and operation of its information and communication systems  disaster recovery  and compliance with laws  regulations and banking best practice 
monitoring of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures is performed through a combination of the bank s internal audit program  through periodic internal and third party compliance reviews  and through the ongoing attention of its managers charged with supervising compliance and operational control 
oversight of these activities is provided by the risk management department and the audit committee of the board of directors of the bank 
off balance sheet arrangements other than loan commitments  the bank does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  and therefore the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
