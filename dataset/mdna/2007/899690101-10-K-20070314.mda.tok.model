fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and requires a two step approach to evaluate tax positions and determine if they should be recognized in the financial statements 
the two step approach involves recognizing any tax positions that are more likely than not to occur and then measuring those positions to determine if they are recognizable in the financial statements 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab is effective as of the end of our fiscal year  allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings during the year of adoption for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab we adopted sab effective as of january  although we believe our prior period assessments of uncorrected differences and the conclusions reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative assessments of such uncorrected differences were appropriate  due to the analysis required in sab  certain historical uncorrected differences related to the application of cash receipts and the elimination of a minority interest related to a former subsidiary were corrected as a cumulative effect net adjustment to increase the opening accumulated deficit balance as of the date of adoption by  prior to  we incorrectly recorded certain cash receipts as a liability and these amounts were included on the balance sheet in the accrued liabilities line item 
this error has previously been considered immaterial  but due to the analysis required upon our adoption of sab  these balances were eliminated by decreasing accrued liabilities by  resulting in a decrease in retained deficit

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in determining the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer arrangements  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of assets  and contingencies and litigation 
when making estimates  we consider our historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent areas where significant judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes license fees for products sold as software or on appliances  subscription based license fees  and transaction based license fees  ii service revenue  which consists of support and maintenance fees  consulting fees  and training fees  and iii intellectual property revenue which includes patent license agreement fees 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period based on the judgments and estimates made by our management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  as set forth in paragraph of sop in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  our standard transfer terms are typically free on board  or fob  shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require the arrangement fee to be due within a maximum of days 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to 
table of contents customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determined that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when payment is received 
we allocate revenue on software transactions  referred to as arrangements in the accounting literature  involving multiple elements to each undelivered element based on their respective fair values 
specifically  in a multi element arrangement we allocate revenue first to undelivered elements such as support and maintenance  consulting services  and training based on each element s fair value and the residual is allocated to the product license as product revenue 
the fair value of support and maintenance fees is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the maintenance  which is typically one year 
the fair value of services not considered essential to the functionality of the product or technology delivered is initially deferred and recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
our determination of the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of the vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when that element is sold separately 
arrangements that include consulting services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the services is recognized separately from the software  provided vsoe of the fair value of these services exists 
if we provide consulting services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software products  both the product revenue and service revenue are recognized under contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor hours except in limited circumstances where completion status cannot be reasonably estimated  in which case the completed contract method is used 
our software products are typically fully functional upon delivery and do not require significant modification or alteration 
for arrangements where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  customers typically purchase consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to perform these services 
software products and related support and maintenance services may be billed separately and independently from professional services  which are typically billed on either a time and materials basis or a fixed fee basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
for fixed fee engagements with milestones or acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized upon completion of a milestone or acceptance  if applicable 
we recognize revenue from patent license agreements when i the patent license agreement is executed  ii the amounts due are fixed  determinable  and billable  and iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we recognize revenue from indirect channels such as resellers using the same criteria as is used for arrangements obtained through our direct sales team 
we typically grant our customers a warranty which guarantees that our products will substantially conform to our current specifications for days from the delivery date 
we account for the estimated cost of product and service warranties in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  based on specific warranty claims received  provided that it is probable that a liability exists  and provided the cost to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim 
costs related to warranty claims were   and in   and  respectively 

table of contents stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the unvested portion of stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january  on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual award consistent with our methodology prior to the adoption of sfas r and consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and compensation cost for these awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize the compensation expense for only those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience during the preceding term that equals the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options is based on the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
our expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of our common stock  over the expected life of the option 
the risk free rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term to the expected life of the option 
where the expected term of our stock based awards does not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are quoted  we perform a straight line interpolation to determine the rate from the available term maturities 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and the amount of stock options expected to be forfeited 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
on june   we exchanged  vested stock options held by employees with exercise prices ranging from to for  vested stock options to those same employees at an exercise price of  which was our common stock price on the date of the exchange 
neither our officers nor members of our board of directors participated in this exchange program 
we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense as a result of the exchange since the fair values of the new awards were less than the fair values of the original awards immediately prior to the exchange 
on july   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to our employees including our executive officers and our directors under our stock option plans 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of july  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock were accelerated 
all of the options accelerated had exercise prices greater than our common stock price of on the date of acceleration 
the weighted average exercise price of the options accelerated was 
in accordance with the provisions of apb  no stock based compensation expense was recognized as a result of the acceleration since the exercise price of all the accelerated options exceeded our common stock price on the date of acceleration 
the purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our consolidated statement of operations upon our adoption of sfas r 

table of contents valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  including review of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  aging of the balance and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging ranges  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may record a specific allowance against amounts owed to us by those customers  and thereby reduce the value of the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
if all collection efforts have been exhausted  we would write off the receivable against the allowance 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
we evaluate goodwill at least on an annual basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas or more frequently if certain indicators are present 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the three months ended june    and  respectively  and no impairment of goodwill was determined as a result of these assessments 
any future impairment loss related to the goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions will not be deductible by tumbleweed for federal income tax purposes 
as of december   we had goodwill of million 
accrual for anticipated operating lease losses we assess anticipated operating lease losses whenever we determine that our usage of our facility space will be impacted by business conditions and subsequently reevaluate anticipated losses each time a sublease is entered into or exited 
changing market conditions make anticipated operating lease losses difficult to determine 
during we recognized a charge of  related to potential losses on an operating lease in slough  united kingdom that was included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs

during  we recognized a  credit related to this same lease that was included in our consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations as merger related and other costs due to the combined cost of the final lease settlement payments  commissions  brokerage fees  and legal fees related to the termination of this lease being less than the existing accrual for the loss on the lease 
during  we recognized a charge of  related to potential losses on an operating lease in palo alto  california that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs 
the charge was estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
this office space was subleased in december for the remainder of the lease term with sublease rental income less than our rent payments due to a weak office rental market in and around palo alto 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with a sublessee  sublease rates  and brokerage fees 
each reporting period we review these estimates  and to the extent that our assumptions change and or actual charges are incurred  the ultimate charge for the loss on this operating lease could vary from our current estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in australia  bulgaria  japan  the netherlands  singapore  switzerland  or the united kingdom denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  our investments are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   none of our cash equivalents were subject to market risk
