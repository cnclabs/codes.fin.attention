item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth 
table of contents in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease or increase in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in production prices 
acreage the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped acreage at december  the acreage is located primarily in the appalachian  mississippi  mid continent and gulf coast onshore areas of the united states 
gross acreage net acreage in thousands developed undeveloped total wells drilled the following table sets forth the gross and net numbers of exploratory and development wells we drilled during the last three years 
the number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells reaching total depth at any time during the respective year 
net wells equals the number of gross wells multiplied by our working interest in each of the gross wells 
productive wells represent either wells which were producing or which were capable of commercial production 
gross net gross net gross net development productive non productive total development exploratory productive non productive under evaluation total exploratory total the exploratory well under evaluation at the end of was a cotton valley well in texas 
we expect to determine the commercial viability of this well during at december   we had capitalized costs of million related to this well 
the three exploratory wells under evaluation at the end of included two new albany shale wells in illinois and a bakken dolomite horizontal oil well in montana 
in  we determined that these wells were not commercially viable  resulting in a million write off

coal reserves and production as of december   pvr owned or controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves located on approximately  acres including fee and leased acreage in kentucky  new mexico  virginia and west virginia 
pvr s coal reserves are in various surface and underground mine seams located on the following properties central appalachia basin properties  located in buchanan  lee and wise counties  virginia  floyd  harlan  knott and letcher counties  kentucky  and boone  fayette  kanawha  lincoln  logan and raleigh counties  west virginia  northern appalachia basin properties located in barbour  harrison  lewis  monongalia and upshur counties  west virginia  san juan basin properties located in mckinley county  new mexico  and illinois basin properties located in henderson and webster counties  kentucky 
coal reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
all of the estimates of pvr s coal reserves are classified as proven and probable reserves 
proven and probable reserves are defined as follows proven coal reserves 
proven coal reserves are coal reserves for which i quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  ii grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and iii the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves 
probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven coal reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are more widely spaced or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven coal reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  pvr performs additional exploration to ensure the continuity and mineability of the coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes or channel samples that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
coal reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s reserves are high in energy content  low in sulfur and suitable for either the steam or metallurgical market 
the amount of coal that a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable coal reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs 

table of contents the following tables set forth production data and reserve information with respect to each of pvr s properties year ended december  property tons in millions central appalachia northern appalachia illinois basin san juan basin total proven and probable reserves at december  property under ground surface total steam metallurgical total tons in millions central appalachia northern appalachia illinois basin san juan basin total the following table sets forth the coal reserves pvr owns and leases with respect to each of its coal properties as of december  property owned leased total tons in millions central appalachia northern appalachia illinois basin san juan basin total pvr s coal reserve estimates were prepared from geological data assembled and analyzed by pvr s general partner s geologists and engineers 
these estimates are compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes  geophysical logs  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
these estimates also take into account legal  qualitative  technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined 
coal reserve estimates will change from time to time due to mining activities  analysis of new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings  modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors 
coal preparation and loading facilities pvr generates coal services revenues from fees it charges to its lessees for the use of its coal preparation and loading facilities 
the facilities provide efficient methods to enhance lessee production levels and exploit pvr s reserves 
historically  the majority of these fees have been generated by pvr s unit train loadout facility on its central appalachia property  which accommodates car unit trains that can be loaded in approximately four hours 
some of pvr s lessees utilize the unit train loadout facility to reduce the delivery costs incurred by their customers 
the coal service facility pvr purchased in november on its coal river property in west virginia began operations late in the third quarter of in the first quarter of  pvr placed into service a newly constructed coal loadout facility for another lessee in west virginia for million 
in september  pvr completed construction of a new preparation and loading facility on property it acquired in in eastern kentucky 

table of contents natural gas midstream systems pvr s midstream operations currently include three natural gas gathering and processing systems and a standalone natural gas gathering system  including i the beaver perryton gathering and processing facilities in the texas oklahoma panhandle area  ii the crescent gathering and processing facilities in central oklahoma  iii the hamlin gathering and processing facilities in west central texas and iv the arkoma gathering system in eastern oklahoma 
these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and three natural gas processing facilities  which have mmcfd of total capacity 
pvr s natural gas midstream business derives revenues primarily from gas processing contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering natural gas volumes and providing other related services
