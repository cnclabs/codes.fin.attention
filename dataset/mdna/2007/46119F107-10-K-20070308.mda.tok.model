overview introgen therapeutics  inc was incorporated in delaware in we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted molecular therapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
we are developing product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers using tumor suppressors  cytokines and other targeted molecular therapies 
these agents are designed to increase production of normal cancer fighting proteins that act to overpower cancerous cells  stimulate immune activity and enhance conventional cancer therapies 
see part i  item business overview above for a more complete discussion of our business 
since our inception in  we have used our resources primarily to conduct research and development activities for advexin therapy and  to a lesser extent  for other product candidates 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate we will incur losses in the future that may be greater than losses incurred in prior periods 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have used cash primarily as follows in thousands year ended december  operating activities purchases of property and equipment principal payments on notes payable we have received cash primarily as follows in thousands year ended december  sales of our common stock proceeds from notes payable proceeds from stock option exercises we expect to incur substantial additional operating expense and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities continue and as we evolve our operations and systems to support commercialization of our product candidates 
these losses  among other things  have caused and may cause our total assets  stockholders equity and working capital to decrease 
we currently earn revenue or income from contract services and process development activities  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m 
d 
anderson cancer center and interest income on cash placed in short term  investment grade securities 
from time to time in the past  we have earned revenue under federal research grants 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders

in november and december  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in direct equity offerings pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
our net proceeds from these transactions  after related expenses payable in cash  were approximately million 
these expenses include approximately million of fees to the placement agent for this transaction  of which million were paid in january and  are payable in equal installments over months through december we will issue warrants to the placement agent to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  exercisable beginning november  and  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  exercisable beginning december these warrants expire in december the shares of common stock issued in the transactions described above were registered pursuant to a registration statement on form s  effective august  commission file no

mortgage note payable in may  we amended the mortgage note payable related to our facilities 
the original million principal balance of our note payable was increased to million 
the proceeds from this increase were used to pay in full the principal and interest outstanding on another note payable with an original principal balance of approximately million  which resulted in that other note being retired 
in addition to this note retirement  the proceeds from this loan amendment were used to pay  of costs related to this transaction and to add  to our cash and cash equivalents 
in april  we exercised our option to extend the note payable to a november maturity date  at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance  estimated to be approximately million  is payable in full 
as a result  the interest rate changed from to and our monthly installments of principal and interest changed from approximately  per month to approximately  per month 
our facilities are pledged as security for the mortgage note payable 
magnum therapeutics corporation in october  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of magnum  a company owned at the time of this acquisition by one of our executive officers 
we paid approximately million for the magnum stock by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million at the acquisition date and assuming liabilities of approximately  magnum s primary asset was the funding it received under a research grant from the nih  which supplemented our ongoing research and development programs 
during the years ended december   and  we earned revenue of  million and million  respectively  under this grant 
funding available for work contemplated under this grant has been fully received and utilized 
no additional revenue will be earned from this grant 
in the event certain of magnum s technologies result in commercial products  we may be obligated to pay royalties related to the sales of those products to certain third parties 
the results of magnum s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the october acquisition date 
since magnum was a development stage company at the time we acquired it  this acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
the total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
during the year ended december   the acquired grant rights were reduced by 
table of contents  as a result of the final contractual settlement of the purchase of magnum 
the fair value of the net assets acquired is as follows in thousands cash and cash equivalents acquired grant rights as of december   the acquired grant rights have been fully amortized and have a net book value of zero at that date 
conversion of preferred stock to common stock in june  the  issued and outstanding shares of our series a non voting convertible preferred stock held by aventis were converted into  shares of our common stock 
the shares of preferred stock were cancelled and replaced by newly issued shares of our common stock 
following the conversion  these shares of preferred stock were cancelled and are no longer issuable 
we received no cash or other consideration in connection with this conversion 
under a voting agreement related to these shares  aventis must vote these shares in the same manner as the shares voted by a majority of the other stockholders on any corporate action put to a vote of our stockholders 
this voting requirement terminates at the earliest of june or the sale of these shares pursuant to an effective registration statement  on the open market or to an aventis non affiliate  as defined in the voting agreement 
pursuant to a demand registration made by aventis in accordance with the terms of a registration rights agreement related to these shares  in november we filed a registration statement on form s file no 
to facilitate the public resale of up to  shares of our common stock held by aventis  which includes the converted shares 
aventis may resell these shares from time to time in the open market pursuant to the registration statement 
we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares held by aventis 
as of december   aventis held approximately million shares of our common stock subject to the voting agreement 
after this conversion  we have million shares of authorized and unissued preferred shares  of which  shares have been cancelled and million shares are undesignated and issuable 
stock options from time to time  we grant options to purchase our common stock to our directors  officers  employees and other service providers in recognition of their contribution to achieving our corporate objectives and as an incentive for their future contributions to the company 
these options typically vest under the following general terms options issued to members of our board of directors vest monthly over months 
options issued to our chief executive officer vest on the date of grant 
options issued to all other persons cliff vest at the rate of per year over four years 
at december   we had  options outstanding to purchase our common stock  of which options to purchase  shares were vested and options to purchase  shares were unvested 
these options have an exercise price equal to the market price of our common on the date of grant  with such exercise prices for options outstanding at december   ranging from to per share 
stock purchase warrants from time to time  we issue stock purchase warrants  generally to investors or placement agents  in connection with sales of our common stock 
at december   we had obligations to issue warrants  and warrants outstanding  to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at prices ranging from per share to per share 
these warrants expire on various dates through december with respect to warrants for  of these shares exercisable through june at per share  we may force their exercise if the average closing market price of our common stock during any consecutive trading days 
table of contents is greater than per share 
these warrants also provide for the downward adjustment of their exercise price in the event we sell shares of our common stock at a price less than their current exercise price 
the exercise price of these warrants was adjusted downward to per share in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in november investment in sr pharma plc in july  we purchased approximately of the issued share capital of sr pharma for approximately million 
as of december   we owned approximately of the issued share capital of sr pharma 
the shares we own had a fair market value of approximately million at december  and million at march  sr pharma is a european biotechnology company publicly traded on the alternative investment market of the lse that is developing oncology and other products 
london stock exchange we are evaluating the feasibility of listing our common stock on the lse  which would be in addition to the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market in the united states 
we believe an lse listing may allow us to better leverage our assets on a global basis and  specifically  in europe and asia 
research grants we earned grant revenue of million  million and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
of those amounts  million  million and  respectively  were earned by magnum  our wholly owned subsidiary  under a grant from the nih 
we have earned and received all amounts available under this magnum grant 
subsequent to december   we became an owner of of the outstanding stock of iri 
the other of iri is owned by our corporate secretary  who is also an introgen shareholder 
we transferred to iri an nih grant originally awarded to us 
iri will be responsible for the remaining research contemplated by that grant and will receive future funding  if any  from the nih under that grant 
we have contractual relationships with iri under which we may perform research and development services for them in the future 
the amount of grant funding  if any  available to us to perform research and development is dependent upon many factors  including the availability of grants from government agencies  our performing the work and incurring the costs contemplated by the grants we currently have  our success in obtaining additional grants in the future and our compliance with statutes and regulations governing such grants 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments include investments in short term  investment grade securities  which currently consist primarily of united states federal government obligations 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
at any point in time  amortized costs may be greater or less than fair value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is downgraded 
marketable securities 
our marketable securities consist of issued share capital of other public companies and are classified as available for sale 
unrealized gains and losses are computed using the published share price of the applicable stock exchange at the close of business on the last day of the reporting period and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity until realized 

table of contents intangible assets 
grant rights acquired  which are presented as an intangible asset on our balance sheet  resulted from our asset acquisition related to the magnum purchase in october we have amortized that asset in its entirety to expense over its estimated life and have no further amortization to record relative to that item in the future 
revenue recognition 
contract services revenue is recognized when the related services are completed and delivered to the customer 
deferred revenue is recorded for cash received for which the related work has not been completed and or the related expense has not been incurred 
grant revenue is recognized as research expense relating to a grant is incurred and the work contemplated under the grant has been performed 
rental income from the sublease of laboratory space to third parties under leases that have variable monthly rent amounts over the term of the lease is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
any cash payments received in excess of rental income recognized is recorded as deferred revenue 
rental income is included in other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations 
research and development costs 
in conducting our clinical trials of advexin therapy and other product candidates  we procure services from numerous third party vendors 
the cost of these services constitutes a significant portion of the cost of these trials and of our research and development expense in general 
these vendors do not necessarily provide us billings for their services on a regular basis and  accordingly  are often not a timely source of information to determine the costs we have incurred relative to their services for any given accounting period 
as a result  we make significant accounting estimates as to the amount of costs we have incurred relative to these vendors in each accounting period 
these estimates are based on numerous factors  including  among others  costs set forth in our contracts with these vendors  the period of time over which the vendor will render the services and the rate of enrollment of patients in our clinical trials 
using these estimates  we record expenses and accrued liabilities in each accounting period that we believe fairly represent our obligations to these vendors 
actual results could differ from these estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the amount of expense recorded and the related accrual 
we have consistently applied these estimation procedures in the past and plan to continue applying such procedures in the same manner during the foreseeable future 
our experience has been that our estimates have reasonably reflected the expense we actually incur 
share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for share based compensation 
from that date forward  we record share based compensation expense for all stock options issued to all persons to the extent such options vest on january  or later 
that expense is determined under the fair value method using the black scholes option pricing model 
we record that expense ratably over the period the stock options vest 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations for determining compensation expense related to our stock option grants 
under that principle  we measured compensation expense for stock options issued to our directors and employees using the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant  which generally resulted in us recording no compensation expense since the intrinsic value of those stock options was typically zero at the date of grant due to the exercise price of those stock options being equal to the fair value of our shares on the date of grant 
compensation expense for stock options issued to all other persons was measured using the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant determined under the black scholes option pricing model  which generally resulted in us recording a compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model we use to compute share based compensation expense requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
items requiring estimation include the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term of a stock option  and the number of stock options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could result in significantly different share based compensation amounts being recorded in our financial statements 
we implemented sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods are not restated

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore we expect to adopt fin at the beginning of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations our operations consist primarily of the research and development of our product candidates and technologies described in item business product development programs above 
our research and development expense includes  but is not limited to  expense related to personnel  facilities and equipment  pre clinical research  clinical trials  manufacturing of materials for use in clinical trials  conducting data analysis and conducting regulatory documentation submissions to the fda 
our research and development expense can be divided between programs in the pre clinical stage and programs in the clinical stage  and general research and development expense attributable to all programs 
we manage our business by tracking research and development expense in these categories in lieu of tracking research and development expense on a project by project basis 
tables setting forth the amount of research and development expense we have incurred in each of these categories are presented below under comparison of the years ended december   and to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years and involves compliance with requirements covering pre clinical research  clinical trials  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials and other work demonstrating our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
the fda and other similar agencies throughout the world have substantial discretion over the work we must perform to obtain regulatory approval 
the likelihood that a product candidate will be commercially successful may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
because of the discretion of the fda and similar agencies throughout the world  as well as the foregoing factors  we cannot predict with reasonable accuracy the future expense we will incur developing these product candidates  when we will complete our work in developing these product candidates or when  if ever  we will earn significant revenue from approved products that might result from these product development programs 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see part i  item a 
risk factors  and particularly the risk factors entitled if we are unable to commercialize advexin therapy in various markets for multiple indications  particularly for the treatment of recurrent head and neck cancer  our business will be harmed  if we fail to comply with fda or foreign regulatory authority requirements or encounter delays or difficulties in clinical trials for our product candidates  we may not obtain regulatory approval of some or all of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all  even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market  
table of contents failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions  if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than we anticipate and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to advance our development program and complete our clinical trials  if we cannot maintain our existing corporate and academic arrangements and enter into new arrangements  we may be unable to develop products effectively  or at all  if we are not able to create effective collaborative marketing relationships  we may be unable to market advexin therapy successfully or in a cost effective manner  and even if we receive regulatory approval to market our advexin therapy  ingn  ingn or other product candidates  we may not be able to commercialize them profitably

contract services  grant and other revenue contract services  grant and other revenue percent increase decrease from previous period n a for the and periods  we earned revenue primarily from research grants from us government agencies and third parties under agreements to provide contract manufacturing process development and product production services 
in the period  we earned revenue from research grants from us government agencies and contract research services provided to aventis  one of our stockholders  under an agreement through which aventis provided funding for the conduct of a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer 
there is significant competition for funding under grants from us government agencies such that we cannot predict the amount of such funding  if any  we might receive in the future 
the change in contract services  grant and other revenue for the period compared to the period was a result of decreased revenue earned under research grants from us government agencies as a result of us substantially completing  subsequent to the period  work to be performed under the grant held by magnum  which was partially offset by increased contract services revenue as a result of the completion of certain contract services which allowed us to recognize revenue for those services that had been deferred in previous periods 
the change in contract services  grant and other revenue for the period compared to the period was a result of increased contract services revenue from third parties under agreements to provide manufacturing process development and product production services for them due to increased emphasis on our part in performing such work

the change in research and development expense in the period compared to the period was a result of increased amortization related to the amortization of grant rights acquired in the purchase of magnum  increased share based compensation expense for the reasons discussed below under share based compensation expense  increased manufacturing and process development costs resulting from ongoing development of production processes for our product candidates  and increased manufacturing process development and product production services for third parties  which were partially offset by decreased costs related to the preparation of the bla for advexin therapy for filing with the fda since  even though that work was ongoing during  significant portions of that initial work were completed in 
table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense percent increase decrease from previous period n a general and administrative expense included share based compensation of million for the period   for the period and  for the period 
the change in general and administrative expense in the period compared to the period was primarily a result of higher share based compensation expense resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
this implementation resulted in us recording share based compensation expense for stock option grants to directors  officers and employees in the period for which there was no comparable expense recorded in the period as allowed by gaap in effect during the period 
the change in general and administrative expense in the period compared to the period was a result of higher share based compensation expense  which increased for the reasons discussed below under share based compensation expense  and increased consulting and professional fees related to the pursuit of foreign capital  which were partially offset by decreased costs related to securities offerings not pursued to completion in the period for which such activities were not repeated in the period

r  share based payments  discussed above under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies share based compensation 
the change in share based compensation expense in the period compared to the period was due to a grant of shares of our common stock to certain of our officers in the period 
this grant was a result of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock held by those officers reaching the end of their stated contractual ten year life and expiring 
to provide them with an economic equivalent to those expired options  we granted those officers an aggregate of  shares of our common stock during the period  of which  shares were issued to those officers and  shares were withheld by us in consideration for our payment on their behalf of approximately  of federal income taxes 
we recorded compensation expense of approximately million in the period in connection with these share issuances 
there was no similar transaction during the period 
our insider trading policy restricts sales of our common stock by our officers and employees 
the expiring options described above could not be exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise program prior to their respective expiration dates due to these insider trading restrictions

we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   million at december  and million at december  our cash equivalents and short term investments are generally comparable financial instruments  with short term investments having original maturity dates in excess of three months 
cash and cash equivalents  exclusive of short term investments  were million at december   million at december  and million at december  considering cash and cash equivalents alone  exclusive of short term investments  the change in those amounts consisted of the following amounts used in operating activities used by investing activities provided by financing activities we expect to continue focusing our activities primarily on conducting phase and other clinical trials  conducting data analysis related to those trials  preparing regulatory documentation submissions to the fda  producing advexin therapy and other clinical materials for use in our clinical trials and conducting pre marketing activities for advexin therapy 
we expect to continue our research and development of various other targeted molecular therapy technologies 
if advexin therapy or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the fda  we expect to conduct activities supporting the marketing  sales  production and distribution of those products  either ourselves or in collaboration with other parties 
the majority of our expenditures for the foreseeable future will most likely be for our activities as they relate to advexin therapy 
these activities may increase the rate at which we use cash in the future as compared to the cash we used for operating activities during the period 
we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next to months 
we may have to make adjustments to the scope of our operations to achieve that objective 
unforeseen events could shorten that time period 
our existing resources may not be sufficient to support the commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
in order to fund our operating losses  we intend to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities the net cash we used in our operating activities relates to the following items net loss the net loss reported in our statement of operations includes certain expenses that do not involve the use of cash 
the following table illustrates the portion of our net loss for which we use cash net loss less expenses not requiring the use of cash depreciation share based compensation amortization of grant rights acquired portion of net loss for which we use cash percent increase decrease from previous period n a see comparison of years ended december   and above for a discussion of the changes in the components of our net loss 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities changes in these accounts arise primarily from variations in the timing of payments to vendors and employees that arise in the ordinary course of business 
this timing is a function of variations in our general business activities  the nature of vendors to whom we have obligations  the nature of payment terms we receive from vendors  the timing of when we elect to make payments to vendors based on our available cash balances and cash flow needs  and the timing of our regularly scheduled paydays for our employees relative to the end of our accounting periods 
the changes in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the  and periods related to one or more of the above items  with no single component of those aggregate changes being material to our business as a whole 
in addition to the above items  the increase in accrued liabilities for the period resulted from the accrual of million in fees payable to a placement agent in connection with their work supporting the sale of our common stock in november and december  which is an accrued liability that did not arise in the and periods 
these fees are payable in and later years 
deferred revenue and other these accounts relate to cash payments for contract manufacturing  process development and product production services work received in advance of completing the work to which the payments relate  which increased our deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue decreases  with no effect on cash  as we complete the work and recognize the related revenue  rental income we receive from the sublease of laboratory space to third parties under leases that have variable monthly rent amounts over the term of the lease 
we recognize this income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
any cash payments received in excess of rental income recognized is recorded as deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue decreases  with no effect on cash  when the cash payments we receive are less than the rental income recognized on a straight line basis  and 
table of contents the long term portion of fees payable to a placement agent that assisted with our sale of common stock in november and december deferred revenue and other decreased  in the period compared to the period  with those changes due to a scheduled decrease during the period in the amount of the monthly rent payments we received under a sublease of a portion of our facilities to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  resulting in the monthly rent payments we received during the period being less than the monthly revenue we recognized on a straight line basis  which caused deferred revenue to decrease during the period  and completion of certain contract services during the period for which revenue recognition had been previously deferred  which allowed us to recognize revenue for those services thereby causing a decrease in deferred revenue  which were partially offset by an increase in other liabilities arising from the long term portion of fees payable to a placement agent that assisted with our sale of common stock in november and december deferred revenue and other increased  in the period compared to the period due to increased contract manufacturing process development and product production services activity during the period for which we received cash payments in advance of completing the work to which the payments related  which increased our deferred revenue 
other assets other assets increased during the period  decreased in the period and increased in the period 
changes in other assets vary in direction and amount based on the timing of and dollars involved in transactions related to items such as prepaid expenses  grant funding receivable and deposits 
the aggregate changes in prepaid assets during the  and periods resulted from such activities that arose during the normal course of our business  with no component of those aggregate changes being material to our business as a whole 
depreciation is an expense in our net loss that does not use cash 
this expense decreased in the period compared to the period due to the absence of significant property and equipment acquisitions during the period and our use of declining balance depreciation methods that result in decreasing depreciation charges over the life of an asset 
depreciation increased in the period compared to the period due to acquisitions of property and equipment during and subsequent to the period for which the first full year of depreciation was the period 
amortization of grant rights acquired is an expense in our net loss that does not use cash 
these grant rights resulted from our acquisition of magnum in october this expense decreased in the period compared to the period due to the completion of activities under the grant from the nih that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of magnum 
this expense increased in the period compared to the period because such amortization was recorded throughout the period but for only a portion of the period because the rights being amortized arose in connection with our acquisition of magnum in october net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities the change in the period compared to the period was primarily due to a higher level of net activity in purchases of short term investments in the period compared to the period arising from normal variations in the amount and timing of purchases and sales of short term investments based on our operating needs for cash and cash equivalents and the availability of cash from sales of our common stock  with those activities offset by  
table of contents a lower level of equipment purchases to support our business being necessary in the period compared to the period since our facilities were substantially fully outfitted in previous periods 
the change in the period compared to the period was primarily due to a lower level of net activity in purchases of short term investments in the period compared to the period due to normal variations in the amount and timing of purchases and sales of short term investments based on our operating needs for cash and cash equivalents and the availability of cash from sales of our common stock  and  a lower level of equipment purchases to support our business being necessary in the period compared to the period 
we have no obligations at this time to purchase significant amounts of additional property or equipment  but our needs may change 
it may be necessary for us to purchase larger amounts of property and equipment to support our clinical programs and other research  development and manufacturing activities 
we may need to obtain debt or lease financing to facilitate such purchases 
if that financing is not available  we may need to use our existing resources to fund those purchases  which could result in a reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available to fund operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities the change in the period compared to the period was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of common stock due to our success in selling more shares of our common stock to raise capital in the period compared to the period  which was offset by a decrease in proceeds from exercise of options for common stock in the period compared to the period  which is activity that can vary based upon the actions of the individuals holding such options  and an increase in principal payments under notes payable in the period compared to the period due to additional borrowings during and subsequent to the period to finance equipment purchased during that period 
the change in the period compared to period was due to a decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock to third parties and a lower level of stock option exercises in the period compared to the period  a decrease in proceeds from notes payable in the period compared to the period as the period included proceeds received from an amendment of a mortgage note in that period  which is an event that did not occur again in the period  and an increase in principal payments under notes payable and capital leases in the period compared to the period due to additional borrowings during and subsequent to the period to finance equipment acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
our risks  risk management strategies and sensitivity analyses estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures at december  are outlined below 
actual results may differ materially from our sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments in investment grade securities  which consist primarily of federal government obligations 
investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and december  using a modeling technique that measures the change in our interest income arising from a hypothetical basis point decrease in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  with all other variables held constant 
the analyses cover our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments 
the analyses use actual maturities for our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments 
the discount rates we used were based on the market interest rates in effect at december  and december  the sensitivity analyses indicated a hypothetical basis point decrease in the interest rates of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  would decrease our interest income by approximately  per year and approximately  per quarter  compared to a decrease in our interest income of approximately  per year and approximately  per quarter as of december  at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt approximated its carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices 
equity price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk from time to time  we may invest in marketable securities of public companies  typically in the form of equity instruments  for business and strategic purposes 
we own british pound denominated shares in sr pharma  a publicly traded company listed on the alternative investment market of the lse 
these marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
unrealized gains and losses in these marketable securities and the related foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity until realized 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in equity prices and foreign currency translation adjustments as a result of our investments in marketable securities 
these marketable securities are subject to significant fluctuation in fair value due to the volatility of the industry in which sr pharma participates and changes in the relative foreign currency values 
we do not hedge our equity price risk or foreign currency translation exposure or invest in derivative securities 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and december  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical decline in the stock price of our marketable securities  a hypothetical decline in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and a simultaneous hypothetical decline in the stock price of our marketable securities and in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the analyses cover all of our public company marketable securities 
the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at december  and december  the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical decrease in the stock price of our marketable securities as of december  would decrease the value of those marketable securities by approximately  compared to a decrease in the fair value of those marketable securities of approximately  as of december   a hypothetical decrease in the value of the british pound as of december  would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities by approximately  compared to a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately  as of december   and a hypothetical decrease in the stock price of our marketable securities and a hypothetical decrease in the value of the british pound  in each case as of december   would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities by approximately million  compared to a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately  as of december  our purchase price for these sr pharma marketable securities was approximately million 
at december   the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately million  which is approximately 
table of contents million greater than our cost 
the impact of the foreign currency translation adjustment in the relative values of the pound and the us dollar was not material during this period
