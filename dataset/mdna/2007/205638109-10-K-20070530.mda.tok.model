released mainframe and distributed product enhancements  during fiscal  designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of our customers 
experienced a decrease in product contribution margin of in fiscal from in fiscal due to the increase in product expenses  primarily technology development and support costs  exceeding the increase in product revenue 
achieved a increase in distributed product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was a reflection of our continued focus on promoting our distributed products and an expanding maintenance base for those products 
experienced a decrease in mainframe product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to a decline in license revenue

product revenue which consists of software license fees and maintenance fees  comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
distributed software product revenue increased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the increases during and were primarily due to license and maintenance revenue growth related to our vantage product line resulting from increased customer demand for performance related software  primarily agentless monitoring  which was added in may when we acquired adlex  inc  and to a lesser extent license and maintenance revenue growth in our changepoint product line 
mainframe software product revenue decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease during was primarily a result of lower license revenue due to decreased demand for software on additional computing capacity in our european operations partially offset by continued growth in maintenance revenue due to strong renewal rates on maintenance contracts 
the decrease during compared to was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue related to our xpediter and file aid product lines 
license fees decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in fluctuations in foreign currencies positively impacted license fees by million in compared to the remaining decrease during was primarily due to a reduction of million in mainframe license fees  partially offset by an increase in distributed license fees related to our vantage product line 
fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted license fees by million in compared to the remaining decrease in was primarily due to weaker demand for our xpediter and file aid product lines partially offset by growth in our vantage product line 
maintenance fees increased million or to million during from million in and increased million or during from million in fluctuations in foreign currencies positively impacted maintenance fees by million in compared to the remaining increase during was primarily due to strong growth in distributed maintenance fees related to our vantage product line and growth in our mainframe maintenance revenue 
the increase in maintenance fees during compared to was primarily due to growth in our vantage product line  partially offset by a million decline in maintenance fees due to the negative impact of foreign currency changes 
we license software to customers using two types of software licenses  perpetual and term 
generally  perpetual software licenses allow customers a perpetual right to run our software on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips millions of instructions per second capacity or to run our distributed software for a specified number of users or servers 
term licenses allow customers a right to run our software for a limited period of time on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips capacity or for a specific number of users or servers 
also  our customers purchase maintenance services that provide technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
furthermore  based on customers business needs  we enter into agreements with our customers that allow them to license additional software and purchase multiple years of maintenance in a single transaction multi year transactions 
in support of these multi year transactions  we allow extended payment terms to qualifying customers 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been delivered to the customer and collection is reasonably probable 
license revenue associated with term transactions or with certain transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement or when all revenue recognition criteria have been met  depending on the terms of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period

del revenue    expenses    product contribution    del 
the product segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
the decrease in the contribution margin from compared to was due to the increase in product expenses  primarily technology development and support costs  exceeding the increase in product revenue 
the improvement in the contribution margin from compared to was primarily due to decreases in sales and marketing expenses and technology development and support costs 
these factors are discussed below 
product expenses include cost of software license fees  cost of maintenance fees  technology development and support costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of duplicating and disseminating products to customers including associated hardware costs and the cost of author royalties 
cost of software license fees increased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in costs for was primarily due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software and an increase in hardware costs resulting from increased demand in our vantage product line 
the decrease in costs for was primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense related to capitalized software acquired as a result of the fiscal programart acquisition that became fully amortized in september as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance fees consists of the direct costs allocated to maintenance and product support such as helpdesk and technical support 
customers who subscribe to maintenance are also eligible to receive the benefit of new releases as well as support 
new releases include significant research and development costs and are available to be licensed to new customers as well as maintenance customers 
cost of maintenance fees decreased  or  during to million from million in and decreased  or during from million in as a percentage of maintenance fees  cost of maintenance fees were  and in  and  respectively  with the percentage decline due to the growth in maintenance revenue 
technology development and support includes  primarily  the costs of programming personnel associated with product development and support less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the period 
also included here are personnel costs associated with developing and maintaining internal systems and hardware software costs required to support all technology initiatives 
as a percentage of product revenue  costs of technology development and support were  and in  and  respectively 
capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
total technology development and support costs incurred internally and capitalized for the years ended march   and were as follows in thousands caption year ended march

before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total technology development and support expenditures increased million or  to million during from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in costs for was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs resulting from increased employee headcount  primarily programming personnel  in order to meet new product initiatives 
the decrease in costs for was primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit costs due to reductions in employee headcount in this area 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with product sales and sales support and marketing for all our offerings 
sales and marketing costs decreased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in as a percentage of product revenue  sales and marketing costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in costs for was primarily attributable to lower bonus and commission costs in due to the decline in mainframe license revenue  partially offset by an increase in stock option expense related to the adoption of sfas r effective april  the decrease in costs for was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and commission costs due to a first quarter sales realignment that reduced headcount 
professional services revenue we offer a broad range of it services to help businesses make the most of their it assets 
some of these services include outsourcing and co sourcing  application services and management  product solutions  project management  enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management services 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease in revenue for primarily occurred in the united states due to cost cutting initiatives and pricing pressures on staff supplementation services for certain customers within the automotive sector 
this reduction was partially offset by growth in application services revenue 
the decrease in revenue for was primarily due to reduced spending from local and state government agencies related to budget reductions on it programs and to reduced spending by our customers in the automotive sector primarily related to cost cutting initiatives adopted by domestic automotive manufacturers and suppliers

during  the professional services segment generated a contribution margin of  compared to and during and  respectively 
the decrease in contribution margin for compared to was primarily due to an increase in subcontractor costs within our european operations related to projects that require specialized skill sets 
the increase in contribution margin for compared to was primarily due to improved utilization of professional services personnel and  to a lesser extent  a concerted effort to reduce low margin subcontractor projects 
cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
cost of professional services increased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in costs for was primarily attributable to an increase in subcontractor expense as specialized skill sets were needed for certain projects within our application services and european operations 
the decrease in costs for compared to was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs of approximately million due to a reduction in employee headcount in this area and reductions in subcontractor expense of approximately million as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce low margin subcontractor projects within our north american operations 
corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the corporate executive  finance  human resources  administrative  legal  communications and investor relations departments 
in addition  administrative and general expenses include all facility related costs  such as rent  building depreciation  maintenance  utilities  etc  associated with worldwide sales  professional services and software development offices 
administrative and general expenses increased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in cost for primarily related to a million increase in donations to charities  a million increase in foreign currency losses primarily related to inter company balances with our wholly owned subsidiaries and a million increase in stock option expense related to the adoption of sfas r effective april  the increases in these costs were partially offset by the effect of the following charges that occurred in an impairment charge of million recorded in the first quarter of related to a purchased software application that management no longer intended to use  impairment charges of million related to our former headquarters building in farmington hills  michigan that were recorded during  and a litigation judgment charge of million recorded during the decrease in cost for was primarily due to a million decline in legal expenses associated with the ibm litigation partially offset by the items discussed above 
other income  net other income consists primarily of interest income realized from investments  interest earned on deferred customer receivables  gain on sale of investment in foresee results  inc foresee  income associated with the ibm settlement agreement and income losses generated from our investments in partially owned companies 
other income increased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the increase in income for was a result of the following increase of million recorded for the gain on sale of our common shares in foresee see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information  increase of million in interest income primarily resulting from higher interest rates earned on investments  partially offset by a lower average balance  and increase of million in income generated from our investments in partially owned companies 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in interest earned on deferred customer receivables resulting from a decline in our non current accounts receivable balance 
the increase in other income for was primarily attributable to a million increase in investment interest income  of which million was due to higher interest rates earned on investments and million was due to having a higher average investment balance throughout compared to in addition  we recorded million to other income related to the ibm settlement  representing the portion of the ibm settlement payment for the year that did not relate to the sale of products or services see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
the income tax provision was million  million and million  respectively  in  and representing an effective tax rate of  and 
during  we reduced our income tax provision by million for certain items related to settlements of prior year tax matters 
substantially all of the decrease concerns taxes related to foreign operations 
approximately million of the reduction was driven by agreement on issues that affected a special deduction and credits afforded to united states based taxpayers that generate income from sales to foreign customers 
in addition  a reduction of million was the result of an agreement regarding the proper character and timing of certain deductions 
the remainder of the reduction is due primarily to interest 
during  we reduced our income tax provision by million for certain items related to settlements of prior year tax matters 
we concluded two separate competent authority proceedings resulting in a reduction to our income tax provision of approximately million 
the remainder of the reduction was due primarily to taxes related to domestic operations  most notably the us research and experimentation tax credit 
we also decreased our valuation allowance by million during the quarter ended march  due almost entirely to us foreign tax credit carryforwards that during the fourth quarter of fiscal became more likely than not to be realized 
for additional information regarding the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate for fiscal  and  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for changes in the restructuring accrual for  and the company is currently examining cost structures and implementing plans to reduce expenses  including consolidation of facilities and workforce reductions 
therefore  the company may incur additional restructuring charges during fiscal management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee 
product revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
future events or inaccuracies in reported credit data that result in a change to collectibility expectations could have a negative effect on our operating results 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statement of position software revenue recognition and modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin and emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
we have an increasing need for flexibility in licensing rights and offerings to our customers 
as our contractual arrangements evolve to meet the needs of our customers  an increasing percentage of our license arrangements must be recognized over the terms of the arrangement 
while this ratable recognition has no impact on our results over time  it may change the timing of forecasted revenue and impact quarterly and annual results 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates 
therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
however  for services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
certain professional services contracts include a project and on going support for the project 
revenue associated with these contracts is recognized over the support period as the customer derives value from the services  consistent with the proportional performance method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product which is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurred or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
to analyze goodwill  we measure its fair value using an estimate of the related business discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill associated with such reporting unit must be further evaluated for impairment 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
investments in partially owned company as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we have a minority investment in and advances to caretech solutions  inc caretech  a privately held company  for strategic purposes 
at march   the net carrying value of our investments and advances to this entity totaled million 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of caretech to assess potential impairment in the carrying value of our investments in and advances to this entity 
we consider their current financial situation  including their ability to meet current cash requirements  expected future cash flows and any other information known to us in determining whether an impairment charge is appropriate 
unknown factors or unforeseen events that impair their ability to pay their obligations or to operate profitably could have an impact on our ability to recoup our investments in and outstanding advances to caretech and could require us to expense all or a portion of the outstanding investments and advances in that period 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
as a result  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events and are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and  to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
in addition  we recognize contingent tax liabilities through tax expense for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions 
we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our results of operations  as appropriate 
it could take several years to resolve certain of these contingencies 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
the expense for unvested stock options at april  is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the expense for all awards granted after april  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate of on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
for sfas no 
r calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in was per option share 
if we increased the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million 
during and  cash flow from operations was million and million  respectively 
during these periods  capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively 
we hold a million revolving credit facility maturing on july  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for a description of the facility 
no borrowings have occurred under this facility 
the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our common stock under two plans  the discretionary plan and the b plan 
under the discretionary plan  the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of a total of up to million of our common stock see note of the consolidated financial statements 
our purchases of stock under the discretionary plan may occur on the open market  through negotiated or block transactions based upon market and business conditions and subject to applicable legal limitations 
during and  we repurchased million shares and million shares  respectively  of our common stock under the discretionary plan at an average price of and per share for a total of million and million  respectively 
approximately million remains authorized for future purchases under the discretionary plan 
we entered into the b plan in december to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock subject to price  volume and timing constraints set forth in the plan pursuant to rule b c of the securities exchange act of the b plan allows the repurchase of our common stock at times when we might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
a broker selected by us has the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase shares on our behalf 
as of march   the company had repurchased million shares for an aggregate million under the b plan and approximately million shares remained authorized for future repurchases 
in may  we executed an amendment to the b plan that  among other things  extended the termination date from june  to september  in conjunction with its approval of the amendment  the board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million shares under the b plan 
the actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend on the terms of the b plan and prevailing market conditions 
the company may terminate the plan at any time 
during fiscal  we entered into a stock repurchase agreement whereby foresee purchased our minority equity interest in foresee for approximately million in cash 
as part of the transaction   of the accrued interest on existing notes due to us was paid  and the notes were modified to increase the interest rate to and to extend the term of the notes so that  will become due with interest at march  and million will become due with interest at march  our prior obligation to make up to  in additional loans to foresee has been terminated see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified the consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes

in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained on its merits if audited and challenged 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
this interpretation will be applicable for us beginning april  we will be required to apply the provisions of this interpretation to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect to be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings 
upon application  management estimates that a cumulative effect of less than million will be required to account for potential tax detriments not previously recognized under historical practice 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and therefore  does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances

the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management is currently evaluating if it will elect the fair value option for any of our eligible financial instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statements of operations to fluctuations in interest rates

we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  and are due approximately million  million  million  million and  in each of the years ending march  through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million and million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated million and million positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets 
we also have non us subsidiaries with financial instruments that are not denominated in their reporting currency 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analyses performed  such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
