item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a global prestige beauty products company 
we sell fragrance  skin care and color cosmetic products in the united states primarily to department stores and mass retailers  as well as internationally in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance  skin care and cosmetic brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
in addition to approximately prestige brands we own or license  we also distribute over additional prestige fragrance brands manufactured by other beauty companies principally to mass retailers in the united states 
our portfolio of owned and licensed fragrance brands includes the elizabeth arden fragrance brands red door  elizabeth arden th avenue  elizabeth arden provocative woman  elizabeth arden green tea  and elizabeth arden mediterranean  the elizabeth taylor fragrance brands white diamonds and elizabeth taylor s passion  the britney spears fragrance brands curious britney spears  fantasy britney spears and britney spears believe  the mariah carey fragrance m by mariah carey  the hilary duff fragrance with lovehilary duff  the danielle steel fragrance danielle by danielle steel  the fragrance brands white shoulders  giorgio and giorgio red  the men s fragrances daytona  hummer tm fragrance for men  and ps fine cologne for men  and the designer fragrance brands of alfred sung  badgley mischka  bob mackie  gant  lulu guinness  nanette lepore  geoffrey beene and halston 
our skin care brands include ceramide  intervene  eight hour cream and prevage tm  and our cosmetic products include the elizabeth arden brand lipstick  foundation and color cosmetic products 
our business strategy to increase net sales  operating margins and earnings is based on a growing the sales of our existing brand portfolio through new product launches and increased advertising and marketing activities  b acquiring control of additional prestige brands through licensing opportunities and acquisitions  c expanding the offering of prestige fragrance products that we distribute on behalf of other beauty companies to mass retail customers  d implementing initiatives to improve our cost structure and working capital efficiencies  and e developing our business in emerging markets 
we manage our business by evaluating net sales  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data and working capital utilization including monitoring our levels of inventory  accounts receivable and operating cash flow 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered as described in item a risk factors and in the section management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
on august   we completed the acquisition of certain assets comprising the fragrance business of sovereign sales  llc  a distributor of prestige fragrances to mass retail customers in north america for over years 
this acquisition helped to expand our north american fragrance business and increase our market share with our mass retail customers 
in addition  on june   we acquired the brand licenses and certain assets of riviera concepts inc the acquired brands included the designer fragrance brands of alfred sung  badgley mischka  lulu guinness  nanette lepore  and bob mackie and the hummer fragrance for men 
during fiscal  we also acquired the exclusive worldwide license for the giorgio beverly hills brand 
we believe the acquisition of these fragrance brands has complemented our fragrance portfolio 
logo 
table of contents for fiscal  our key focus will be on improving our operating margins  cash flow from operations and return on invested capital 
we are implementing a variety of initiatives relating to our extended supply chain  logistics functions and enterprise information systems that we believe will provide improved operating and financial performance 
our financial results for the fiscal year ending june   will also depend on our ability to successfully launch new products  particularly our new fragrances for mariah carey and britney spears  to successfully introduce our fragrance brands to additional retailers and to continue to grow our international sales 
new product introductions require additional upfront spending for marketing  development and promotional expenses 
to the extent one or more of our new product introductions or our efforts to expand operating margins or grow international sales are not as successful as we had planned  it could result in a reduction of our profitability and cash flow 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding our operating results and financial condition 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ  and the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
in this process  we often obtain the assistance of third party valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks and other intellectual property  customer relationships and lists  non compete agreements and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually 
our intangibles are reviewed for impairment or reconsideration of the useful life assigned as circumstances dictate using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives  as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
during the quarter ended june   we performed our annual impairment testing of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the analyses and assessments of these assets indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
periodically  we review the lives assigned to our long lived assets and adjust the lives  as circumstances dictate 
logo 
table of contents long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns represents management s estimate of future returns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for certain promotional product 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
hedge contracts 
we have designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire 
share based compensation 
all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  but only to the extent that vesting is considered probable 
compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the market based restricted stock awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation model  and the fair value of all other restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation costs for awards are amortized using the straight line method 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions are based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
logo 
table of contents we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience and other key factors 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination

year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased  or approximately million  for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
the increase is due to approximately million  or  of higher fragrance sales primarily from the sovereign acquisition and the introduction of new brands  including the with lovehilary duff fragrance  the danielle by danielle steel fragrance and the riviera brands  and approximately million  or  of higher sales of elizabeth arden branded skin care and color products 
the increase in fragrance sales reflects the loss of distributed brands previously manufactured by unilever cosmetics and lower sales of britney spears fragrances  as we did not launch a major britney spears product this fiscal year as compared to last year 
pricing changes had an immaterial effect on net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the higher sales volumes 
gross margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the logo

sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or approximately million  for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase was principally due to employee compensation costs of million that were primarily incentive related  higher advertising  promotional  royalty and product development costs of million mainly related to new fragrance launches  the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates of million  and costs of million associated with our restructuring plans announced in may  primarily in our european operations 
also contributing to the increase were transition costs associated with the riviera and sovereign acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase is primarily a result of the amortization of intangible assets associated with the riviera and sovereign acquisitions and higher depreciation costs due to the higher level of capital additions during the fiscal years ended june  and as compared to the prior period 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the increase is a result of higher average borrowings under our credit facility primarily due to the payment of approximately million of cash for the sovereign acquisition 
debt extinguishment costs

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of approximately million was recorded for the year ended june   compared to approximately million for the year ended june   due to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest expense 
the income tax provision for the year ended june   reflects an adjustment to the annual effective tax rate for increased earnings contributions from our worldwide affiliates  which generally have tax rates lower than the us federal statutory rate  as well as an adjustment to record a benefit from research and development tax credits attributable to prior years and the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with the tax benefit for net operating losses generated by certain international subsidiaries  which are now expected to be utilized

table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased

the consolidation of certain retail customers  such as federated department stores and the may company  and retail customers implementing inventory control initiatives also negatively affected net sales 
pricing changes had an immaterial effect on the net sales increase 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  gross margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  primarily as a result of proportionately higher sales of owned and licensed fragrances into mass retail channels of distribution and higher promotional sales

interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the small decrease is primarily due to lower average monthly borrowings on our revolving credit facility offset  in part  by higher interest rates on our revolving credit facility and on the interest rate swap agreement prior to our termination of that agreement in march debt extinguishment costs

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in the year ended june   approximately of our net sales were made during the first half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers and new product launches  sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales  operating margin  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
increased sales of skin care and cosmetic products relative to fragrances may reduce the seasonality of our business 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory levels normally from july to october and peak receivable balances normally from september to december 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the months of december  january and february of each year  cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received
