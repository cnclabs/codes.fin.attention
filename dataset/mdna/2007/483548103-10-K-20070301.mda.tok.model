item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has various market risk exposures that arise from our ongoing business operations 
market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the company s financial results would be impacted by changes in interest rates  certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rates the company s primary exposure to interest rate risk relates to our financial instruments 
these financial instruments include long term debt obligations with fixed interest rates and revolving credit facilities with interest at current market rates 
the level of fees and interest charged on revolving credit commitments and borrowings are based upon borrowing levels  market interest rates  and the company s credit rating 
the company s interest rate risk is derived primarily from our outstanding variable rate revolving credit facilities 
the principal facility is a million revolving credit agreement that expires august  this credit facility was recently increased to million in january the other facilities  established for foreign operations  are comparatively insignificant in amount 
changes in market interest rates or the company s credit rating would impact the interest rates on these facilities 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to the company s million of variable rate credit facilities debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in the company s annual interest expense and thus pre tax earnings 
foreign currency the company has manufacturing  sales  and distribution facilities in various locations throughout the world 
as a result  the company makes investments and conducts business transactions denominated in foreign currencies  including the us dollar  the european euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  the taiwan dollar  and the australian dollar 
the company manages foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the subsidiary operations level 
sometimes the company may  through the use of forward contracts  hedge the price risk associated with committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and rates 
historically the use of these forward contracts has been minimal 
the company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
additionally the company maintains a euro note facility  which qualifies and has been designated as  an effective hedge against the investment in our german subsidiary 
throughout  the euro has been stronger than the us dollar  which has resulted in foreign currency gains for this subsidiary 
the euro note has acted as an effective hedge against currency gains or losses 
total foreign sales  including foreign export sales  averaged approximately million over the last three years 
more than half of our foreign sales are to europe or canada 
due to relatively small amount of foreign sales compared to total consolidated net sales  less than  management believes that any near term changes in currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
commodity prices the company is exposed to volatility in the price of raw materials used in certain manufacturing operations as well as a variety of items procured for its distribution businesses 
these raw materials include  but are not limited to  aluminum  titanium and other specialty metals 
the company manages its exposure related to these price changes through strategic procurement and sales practices
