the breakdown of revenue between chinese and international sales is as follows 
chinese and international revenue revenue year year change china   international   in revenue from china decreased to million  or compared to million in at the beginning of  we began selling semi finished products to tianshi engineering 
in order to qualify for a direct selling license in china  tianshi engineering  our related party customer in china  is required to produce a part of the products that it sells in china 
as a result  in  we began to sell semi finished products to tianshi engineering  which jointly shares with us licenses to produce  manufacture and sell the products 
these semi finished products have a lower sales price than the finished products we had previously sold to tianshi engineering 
in addition  we believe that sales to china in were negatively impacted by other factors  including o continued consumer uncertainty in china regarding the impact of recently enacted direct selling regulations and uncertainty regarding the timing of the direct selling license application process and approval  and o increased government and media scrutiny on the direct selling industry  particularly following publication of new direct selling regulations at the end of the application of tianshi engineering for a direct selling license in china is still pending 
until the application is approved  tianshi engineering will continue to sell our products through its branches and chain stores in china

gross profit decreased by to million in  compared to million in the gross profit margin for was compared to in as a result of the reasons discussed under cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses

on june   we entered into a written lease agreement with tianshi group to pay annual rent at of our total gross revenues 
the term of this agreement is for five years commencing on january  because the rent is based upon a percentage of our gross total revenues  we are not able to include a fixed figure in the table relating to this obligation 
the total amount paid on this was  for the months ended december  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the account receivable related parties increased by million  from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to payment extensions given to tianshi engineering to allow it to fund its marketing efforts in china in anticipation of receiving a direct selling license in china 
inventories at december  decreased to million compared to million at december  at the beginning of we started selling semi finished goods to tianshi engineering to enable it to qualify for a direct selling license in china 
therefore  there were less finished products in inventory 
accounts payable increased to million as of december  compared to million  as of december  the increase was mainly due to longer credit terms given by our suppliers 
property  plant and equipment increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase was primarily due to costs related to the construction of a new conference center at our headquarters in tianjin 
we typically generate positive cash flow from operations due to favorable gross margins 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease primarily reflects an increase in accounts receivable related parties of million and an increase in other receivable related parties of million

this increase was mainly due to the short term loan of million made by biological to tianshi engineering and a loan of million relating to the yihai project made to the local government 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to million for in we paid two installment payments totaling million relating to the million loan for the yihai project 
as of december  and december   we had cash of million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the short term loan to tianshi engineering and the loan to the local government relating to the yihai project 
approximately of the cash was held in the bank account of biological and in the bank account of tiens yihai 
going forward  our primary requirements for cash consist of o the continued production of existing products and general overhead and personnel related expenses to support these activities  o continued promotion of networking sales activities  o the development costs of new products  and o expansion of production scale to meet the demands of our markets 
we anticipate that our current operating activities will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements for we estimate that the construction of our tiens yihai research  development and manufacturing facility will require approximately million 
if we receive approval to proceed with the development of the tiens yihai project  we may require additional financing to fund the project 
management assumptions management anticipates  based on internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our current operations that existing cash and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital for at least the next months 
in the event that our business plans change  our assumptions change or prove inaccurate or if other capital resources and projected cash flow otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations due to unanticipated expense  technical difficulties  or otherwise  we could be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

we believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from domestic sales by distributors in china  net of sales commissions and taxes only when the related chinese distributor recognizes sales of the company s products to unaffiliated third parties 
we recognize revenue from international sales non chinese to both affiliated and unaffiliated third parties  net of commissions and taxes as goods are shipped and clear review by the international customs department 
we generally are not contractually obligated to accept returns 
however  on a case by case negotiated basis  we permit customers to return their products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
such reserves are based upon management s evaluation of historical experience and estimated costs 
the amount of the reserves ultimately required could differ materially in the near term from amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   tianshi engineering  an affiliated company  owned all of the related party distributors which sell our products in china 
allowance for doubtful accounts our trade accounts receivables are mainly due from related companies 
management reviews its accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year end  paying particular attention to the age of receivable outstanding 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out basis 
management reviews inventory annually for possible obsolete goods or to determine if any reserves are necessary for potential obsolescence

based on chinese government regulations  all foreign currencies under the category of current accounts are allowed to be freely exchanged with hard currencies 
on july   the chinese government approved the increase in the valuation of rmb against the us dollar by 
because we report our revenues in us dollars  changes in the valuation of rmb may impact our net income
