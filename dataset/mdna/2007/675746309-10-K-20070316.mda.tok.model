executive summary strategic goals ocwen financial corporation is a leading provider of servicing and origination processing solutions to the loan industry 
our primary goal is to make our client s loans worth more by leveraging our superior processes  innovative technology and high quality  cost effective global human resources 
residential servicing business overview ocwen is one of the largest servicers of subprime mortgage loans 
these loans have typically been securitized in real estate mortgage conduits remics 
as of december   we were serving  borrowers with an aggregate upb of  we collect approximately  per year in monthly mortgage payments and one time payoffs on behalf of the owners of these loans 
these collections are initially deposited to a clearing account and then transferred to segregated custodial accounts for the various remic trusts 
remittances are made monthly to the remic trustees who then forward cash distributions to the investors pursuant to the terms of their notes  which were created in the related securitization transaction 
subprime mortgage loan servicing involves special loss mitigation challenges not usually present in prime loan servicing 
over a period of years  ocwen has applied scientific management to developing proprietary best practices for reducing loan losses 
we have embedded those best practices in our technology in order to ensure that they are consistently and efficiently applied 
our eight global operating centers allow us to recruit in broad  deep talent pools 
rigorous screening and training of our workforce allows us to implement specialized loss mitigation techniques that minimize delinquencies 
our proactive measures to keep borrowers current on their payments are effective in forestalling delinquencies in the overwhelming majority of the cases 
the best outcome for the loan investor is to keep the loan performing 
when a delinquency occurs  we are successful in approximately of the cases in working out a resolution that avoids a foreclosure 
ocwen prides itself on keeping borrowers in their homes and avoiding foreclosure 
this is a win win situation for both the investors and borrowers that we serve 
cash flow characteristics in accordance with to the pooling and servicing agreements under which we service the loans  we are entitled to the interest income on the custodial account cash float balances  fees for providing services and ancillary charges such as late fees and speedpay fees 
float interest income  servicing fees and ancillary fees are recorded in the revenue line item servicing and subservicing fees on our consolidated statements of operations 
when a borrower becomes delinquent  we advance cash to the remic trustees on the scheduled remittance date thus creating a receivable due us from the remic trust 
we advance principal and interest p i advances  taxes and insurance t i advances and legal fees  maintenance and preservation costs on properties heading into the foreclosure process and on properties that have already been foreclosed corporate advances 
if we determine that we cannot recover our advances by working with the borrower or from the value of the property  we generally have the right to halt advances  declare the advances to be non recoverable  and then  in most cases  recover our advances from the respective general collections accounts owned by the remic trustees 
most of our advances have the highest standing and are top of the waterfall so that we are entitled to repayment before any interest or principal is paid on the bonds 
we finance our advances to the greatest extent possible with barclays capital  inc  greenwich capital financial products  inc 
and our banking syndication  which is led by jpmorgan chase bank  na in  our average float balances were approximately  and our average advance balances were approximately  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that convert to fixed rates the float earnings on  of average float balances 
we have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that convert to variable rates the  of our advance financing that carries fixed rates 
including the effect of these swap agreements  the interest expense on our advance financing and the interest income on the majority of our float balances are expressed as spreads over libor and thus rise and fall in tandem 
as a result  our net exposure to changing interest rates is largely limited to the difference in the spread between float interest income and advance financing interest expense 
we service loans generally under two types of arrangements 
first  and in the majority of cases  we purchase the msrs  which generally entitle us to receive basis points annually on the average upb of the loans serviced 
we typically purchase the msrs for between and basis points of the upb at time of transfer or securitization of the loans 
second  we service loans under subservicing arrangements where we do not pay for the msrs 
under subservicing arrangements  we generally receive between and basis points annually on the upb 
key business drivers prepayment speed 
the most significant driver of our business is prepayment speed  which is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down their upb 
prepayment speed has a significant impact on servicing fees  amortization of servicing rights  float income and compensating interest expense 
if prepayment speed increases  our servicing fees will decrease because of the decline in the upb on which those fees are based 
additionally  since we amortize servicing rights in proportion to total expected income over the life of a portfolio  an increase in prepayment speed will lead to accelerated amortization expense as we revise downward our estimated life of the pool of loans being serviced 
conversely  decreases in prepayment speeds drive increased revenue and can extend the period over which we amortize msrs 
when interest rates rise  it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their loans  and as a result  prepayment speed tends to decrease 
when rates fall  prepayment speed tends to increase 
prepayment speed also affects our float balances  which in turn affects float income 
increased prepayment speed leads to higher float balances since we hold the entire loan pay off amount as opposed to a single monthly payment 
these higher float balances lead to increased float income 
slower prepayment speed leads to lower float balances and income 
in addition  prepayment speed has a significant impact on compensating interest expense 
faster prepayment speeds mean that more loans pay off early  which drives higher compensating interest expense 
slower prepayment speeds lead to lower compensating interest expense 
compensating interest expense is included in servicing and origination expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
aggregate unpaid principal balance 
aggregate upb is a key revenue driver 
as noted earlier  servicing fees are usually earned as a percentage of the upb  and growth in the portfolio means growth in servicing fees 
additionally  a larger servicing portfolio generates more ancillary fees and larger custodial balances  which generate greater float income 
larger upb also drives increased expenses 
to the extent that we grow upb through the purchase of msrs  our amortization of msrs will generally increase with our servicing revenues 
we will also incur additional interest expense to finance the purchase of msrs and servicing advances and our compensating interest expense  which represents the difference between the full month of interest that we are required to remit to the remic trustee in the month that a loan pays off and the amount of interest that we actually collect from the borrower for that month  will increase as the size of our portfolio increases 
the following table shows average aggregate upb  prepayment speeds and certain revenue and expense items for the years ended december  and prepayment speed annual cpr average upb of loans serviced average float balances servicing fees float earnings amortization of servicing rights compensating interest expense delinquencies 
delinquencies also affect our results of operations 
we consider loans that have been delinquent for days or more to be non performing 
non performing loans are more expensive to service than performing loans because our cost of advance funding and our cost of servicing are higher 
when borrowers are delinquent  the amount of funds that we are required to advance on behalf of borrowers increases 
while the collectibility of advances generally is not an issue  we do incur costs to finance those advances 
we utilize both securitization  ie  match funded liabilities and revolving credit facilities to finance our advances 
as a result  increased delinquencies result in increased interest expense 
the cost of servicing non performing loans is higher than the cost of servicing performing loans primarily because the industry leading loss mitigation techniques that we employ to keep borrowers in their homes are more costly than the techniques used in handling a performing loan 
when loans are performing we have limited interaction with the borrowers  and relatively low cost customer service personnel conduct most of that interaction 
once a loan becomes delinquent  we employ our superior loss mitigation capabilities to work with the borrower and return the loan to performing status 
these procedures involve increased contact with the borrower and the development of forbearance plans by highly skilled consultants who command higher compensation 
on those occasions when loans go into foreclosure  we incur additional costs related to coordinating the work of local attorneys to represent us in the foreclosure process 
finally  when we foreclose on loans  we employ specialists to service the real estate and manage the sale of those properties on behalf of our investors 
a significant increase in delinquencies would cause us to increase our activities in these areas  resulting in increased operating expenses 
this increase in operating expenses should be somewhat offset by increased late fees for loans that become delinquent but do not enter the foreclosure process 
the following table summarizes our average performing and non performing loans  our average advance balances  interest expense on match funded liabilities and lines of credit  and operating expenses directly related to loss mitigation activities for the years ended december average number of performing loans serviced average number of non performing loans serviced average number of total loans serviced average advance balance interest expense on match funded liabilities and lines of credit operating expenses directly related to loss mitigation activities for the two months ended february   the average number of non performing loans was  or of the total 
the reduction in operating expenses is primarily due to our continued focus on cost control and efficiency 
we have a program of continuous improvement utilizing six sigma to enhance our processes  technology and how we employ our global human resources sensitivity of servicing income to certain factors 
assuming short term interest rates remain constant  our internal modeling of a typical subprime servicing pool of loans  where we purchased the msrs  would indicate that a point change in prepayment speeds would result in approximately a change in net servicing income over the life of the transaction  while a point change in delinquency rates would result in approximately a change in net servicing income over the life of the transaction 
assuming that prepayment speed and delinquencies remain constant  a basis point change in short term interest rates would result in approximately a change in net servicing income 
residential origination services our residential origination services segment consists of three components fee based loan processing businesses 
these businesses provide various loan processing services to clients involved in the mortgage origination  servicing  loan acquisition and securitization processes 
the services that we provide to our clients include residential property valuation services mortgage due diligence title services loan refinancing for residential servicing customers  and outsourcing services  including mortgage underwriting  data entry  call center services and mortgage research these fee based businesses have limited capital requirements 
we believe that our success in this area will be dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our operating costs and continue to improve the quality and timeliness of service delivery so that we can provide high quality products at competitive prices 
trading and investing activities 
this business includes our investments in subprime residual mortgage backed securities as well the results of our whole loan purchase and securitization activities  including the loans remaining from our subprime origination business 
the key to our results in this area is the performance of our assets  particularly with respect to default risk associated with our loans held for resale and with the loans underlying our mortgage backed securities 
we are also subject to funding risk related to the various credit facilities that we use to finance these activities 
for the two months ended february   unrealized losses on our subordinate and residual securities amounted to  these losses were largely offset by gains on our credit default swaps of  for a net loss of for the period 
on loans held for resale  we recorded charges of  for the two months ended february  to reduce the loans to estimated market value 
subprime originations 
we entered the subprime originations business in an effort to improve our position in the value chain by exercising some control over the supply of loans that we service 
as discussed below  subsequent to december   we have decided to close our subprime origination operations 
ocwen recovery group ocwen recovery group is our unsecured collections business 
operating losses for ocwen recovery group in and have primarily been the result of our not generating sufficient revenue to absorb our fixed costs during a period when we were transitioning from very high margin proprietary collections to lower margin third party collections 
at the same time  we were transitioning to a global collections platform where we invested in developing a global collections capability that is now consistently in the top quartile of competitive comparisons 
this involved an investment in senior management leadership  development of proprietary procedures  training and certain upgrades to our technology 
during this period  we focused on optimizing our cost structure and improving unit margins  primarily by improving the productivity of our cost efficient global work force 
as a result of this focus  we have seen a marked increase in our unit margins 
we believe the key to our success in this segment will be our ability to generate sufficient top line revenue growth to leverage our fixed operating costs and take advantage of our strong unit margins 
in this regard  we are pursuing growth opportunities both organically and via acquisition 
we are currently in the latter stages of negotiations to acquire by merger a large provider of receivables management services  subject to final due diligence and execution of definitive transaction documents 
changes in financial condition total assets grew to  at december   as compared to  as of december  this  increase in total assets was primarily due to a  increase in servicing advances and match funded advances  a  increase in trading and investment securities  a  increase in net deferred tax assets  a  increase in msrs and a  increase in other assets 
the increase in advances was largely due to the growth in our servicing portfolio during the increase in deferred tax assets  net  resulted primarily from the reversal of  of valuation allowances 
the increase in other assets was primarily the result of our  investment in bms holdings 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in loans held for resale  largely reflecting three securitization transactions that closed during the year 
total liabilities declined to  at december   as compared to  at december  this  decrease in total liabilities was largely the result of a  decline in amounts due under lines of credit and other secured borrowings  primarily reflecting reduced funding requirements on the lower balance of loans held for resale 
this decline was offset in part by a  increase in match funded liabilities  primarily due to an increase in borrowing capacity on servicing advances  and an  increase in servicer liabilities 
at december   we had  of stockholders equity  a  increase over december  that was primarily due to net income of  for results of operations we recorded net income of  for  as compared to net income of  and  for and  respectively 
our diluted earnings per share were for  as compared to and for and  respectively 
net income for includes an income tax benefit of  that primarily reflects the reversal of  of deferred tax asset valuation allowances to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
net income for includes an income tax benefit of  that largely resulted from a  partial reversal of the valuation allowance that we had established on our deferred tax asset in prior years 
pre tax income was   and  for  and  respectively 
our results reflect a strong performance in our residential servicing segment  which is our most profitable segment with pre tax income of   and  for  and  respectively 
the significant increase in pre tax earnings in was primarily due to higher servicing fees because of growth in the portfolio and slower run off of the existing portfolio because of a reduction in mortgage prepayments 
in addition  rising short term interest rates have increased revenue from custodial accounts float earnings 
in spite of the revenue growth  operating expenses declined slightly in because of cost containment measures and the positive impact of slower prepayment speeds on amortization and interest due on loan pay offs 
the costs of financing servicing advances and servicing rights increased in because of the growth in these assets and rising interest rates 
pre tax results of our residential origination services segment improved by  in because of higher earnings from our fee based loan processing activities partially offset by higher losses in our sub prime origination activities  which we have discontinued in liquidity at december   we had  of unrestricted cash and  of investment grade securities  which represented of total assets 
no investment grade securities held at december  were pledged to support borrowings under repurchase agreements or other credit facilities 
during  we increased our borrowing capacity under match funded liabilities and lines of credit and other secured borrowings from  at the beginning of the year to  at december  in addition  we expanded the range of assets that could be funded through borrowing under these facilities to include additional msrs and various kinds of receivables 
of this available capacity   was unused at the end of during  cash declined by  as cash we used for our investing and financing activities exceeded cash provided by our operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities in of  is largely related to net cash provided from loans held for resale  offset in part by an increase in residential servicing advances that primarily resulted from growth in the servicing portfolio and the purchase of investment grade trading securities 
investing activities used  in primarily related to the purchase of msrs  investment in certificates of deposit and the investment in bms holdings 
on february   we received a cash distribution of  which is equal to our original investment 
cash used by financing activities in of  primarily relates to the repayment of credit lines and other secured borrowings  largely reflecting the decline in funding requirements for loans held for resale  partially offset by the issuance of a  fixed rate match funded term note to fund servicing advances 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our residential servicing business 
inherent in our growth of this business has been the acquisition of msrs  an intangible asset representing the present value of the right to service loans in a portfolio 
as of december   we held  of residential msrs with a fair value of  the most critical accounting policy for this business is the methodology we use to determine the value of msrs 
application of this methodology requires the development of a number of estimates  including anticipated amortization and periodic revaluation 
we estimate the fair value of our msrs based on the results of our internal valuation 
our internal valuation calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows utilizing market based assumptions provided by an independent third party valuation specialist and historical experience 
the more significant assumptions used in our internal valuation include prepayment speeds discount rate cost of servicing interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances delinquency experience interest rate used for computing float earnings compensating interest expense we derive prepayment speeds and delinquency assumptions from our historical experience 
we base our strata on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
our strata include subprime re performing alt a special servicing high loan to value other at december   we had msrs relating to only the subprime  alt a and high loan to value strata 
the table presented below provides overall prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage by strata projected over the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value we develop the discount rate internally 
our third party valuation specialist provides the market assumptions on which we base the interest rate for the cost of financing advances  the interest rate for float earnings and the cost of servicing 
as of december   these assumptions were as follows discount rate of interest rate of one month libor plus basis points for the cost of financing advances interest rate equal to the federal funds rate for float earnings assumptions regarding the cost of servicing vary by strata and range from a low of per year for a performing alt a loan to a high of per year for a loan that is in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as summarized below increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster  causing higher msrs amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by lower overall cost of servicing and increased float balances and income 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense increases 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the combined cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions for the cost of servicing advances will increase interest expense while rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize as fee income 
increases in interest rate assumptions also generally increase the value of our msrs as the projected prepayment rate for the underlying loans slows  while decreases in interest rate assumptions generally reduce the value of our msrs as the projected prepayment rate for the underlying loans increases 
we perform an impairment analysis based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value after grouping our loans into the applicable strata 
in determining the amount of impairment  we consider both our internal fair value and the fair value provided by our third party valuation specialist 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio  the type of asset mortgage or non mortgage and the default risk 
we amortize msrs over the period of estimated net servicing income based on our projections of the amount and timing of future cash flows 
with the exception of the period of estimated net servicing income  we determine these projections using the same assumptions that we use in our internal valuation of msrs 
the amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is adjusted periodically based on actual results and updated projections 
during and most of  mortgage prepayment speeds in our servicing portfolio remained high  resulting in a substantial rate of amortization of the balance of servicing rights 
higher mortgage interest rates and a leveling off of the gains in housing values resulted in lower mortgage prepayment speeds and a slower rate of amortization in valuation of deferred tax assets another accounting policy that requires the use of estimates and the application of judgment is the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and a corresponding valuation allowance of resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  during  we reversed  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  including  during the second quarter  in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
we established our valuation allowance during the period through during  we recorded a  partial reversal of the valuation allowance we had established on the deferred tax asset in prior years 
this reduction in the allowance in was the result of refund claims we filed with the irs that reduced our deferred tax asset and increased our income tax receivable balance by the same amount 
the evaluation of the need to maintain valuation allowance takes into consideration all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits are also considered 
significant judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to realizability of the deferred tax assets 
we base the determination of the amount of the aggregate valuation allowance on scenario analyses of the projected results of operations by line of business resulting in a range of potential valuation allowances  within which a final amount is determined 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
litigation our policy is to continuously monitor the status of our legal matters  including advice from external legal counsel  and periodically perform assessments of these matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we make a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred  and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
valuation of trading securities and loans held for resale we currently account for our investment grade  residual and subordinate securities as trading securities at fair value 
we report changes in fair value in income in the period of change 
we determine fair value based on either third party dealer quotations  where available  or internal values 
our internal valuations are determined using internally developed models that estimate fair value using estimates of future cash flows 
expected future cash flows are estimated using assumptions such as discount rates and prepayment speeds and expected losses associated with the loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
as of december   investment grade securities had a fair value of  net of unrealized losses of residual and subordinate securities had a fair value of  at december   including net unrealized gains of  we classify loans that we do not intend to hold to maturity as loans held for resale and report them at the lower of cost or market value 
we account for the excess of cost over market value as a market valuation reserve with changes in the reserve included in gain loss on loans held for resale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
loans for which we have entered into an agreement to sell to an investor at a set price are valued at the commitment price 
for uncommitted performing loans  we estimate fair value based on quotes for similar loans 
we base the fair value of uncommitted non performing loans on estimates of expected future cash flows discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs until the loans are sold 
these fees and costs are considered in the carrying value of the loans when determining a market valuation reserve 
as of december   loans held for resale of  were net of market valuation reserves of  segments the following section provides a discussion of the changes in financial condition of our business segments during the year ended december  and a discussion of pre tax results of operations of our business segments for the three yearly periods ended december   and the following table presents the assets and liabilities of each of our business segments at december  residential servicing ocwen recovery group residential origination services corporate items and other business segments consolidated assets cash trading securities investment grade subordinates and residuals investment in certificates of deposit loans held for resale advances match funded advances mortgage servicing rights receivables deferred tax asset  net premises and equipment other assets total assets liabilities match funded liabilities servicer liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings debt securities other liabilities total liabilities the following table presents the pre tax statement of operations for each of our business segments for the year ended december  residential servicing ocwen recovery group residential origination services corporate items and other business segments consolidated revenue servicing and subservicing fees process management fees other revenues total revenue operating expenses compensation and benefits amortization of servicing rights servicing and origination technology and communications professional services regulatory fees occupancy and equipment other operating expenses total operating expenses other income expense interest income interest expense gain loss on trading securities gain loss on loans held for resale  net gain loss on debt repurchases other  net other income expense  net pre tax income loss residential servicing the following table sets forth information regarding residential loans and real estate serviced for others loans real estate total amount count amount count amount count december  performing non performing december  performing non performing at december   we serviced  subprime loans with a upb of  as compared to  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  subprime loans represent residential loans we service that were made to borrowers who generally did not qualify under guidelines of fannie mae and freddie mac nonconforming loans 
non performing loans have been delinquent for days or more 
performing loans are current or have been delinquent for less than days 
we serviced under subservicing contracts  residential loans with a upb of  as of december  this compares to  residential loans with a upb of  at december  the average upb of assets serviced during  and was   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth information regarding the changes in our portfolio of residential assets serviced for others amount count servicing portfolio at beginning of year additions runoff servicing portfolio at end of year additions primarily represent servicing purchased from the owners of the mortgages  servicing retained in connection with the securitization of our own loans and servicing obtained by entering into subservicing agreements with other entities that own the servicing rights 
runoff includes principal repayments on loans  servicing transfers and other asset resolutions 
in addition to acting as servicer and subservicer  we have entered into a backup servicing agreement with a large trust company that acts as trustee for securitizations encompassing more than  of mortgage loans 
as backup servicer  we have agreed to accept the servicing responsibilities on up to  of mortgage loans in the event that the trustee terminates the primary servicer 
the agreement requires that we complete within days the transfer of servicing from the terminated primary servicer 
as back up servicer  we are entitled to all servicing compensation to which the terminated servicer would have been entitled 
we are not required to fund the delinquency or servicer advance obligations or the compensating interest obligations on the loans that we accept 
comparative selected balance sheet data is as follows december  total assets advances match funded advances msrs total liabilities match funded liabilities servicer liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings advances 
during any period in which the borrower is not making payments  we are required under certain servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors  pay property taxes and insurance premiums and process foreclosures 
we also advance funds to maintain  repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors 
we are entitled to recover advances from borrowers for reinstated and performing loans and from investors for foreclosed loans 
however  we are only obligated to advance funds to the extent that we believe the advances are recoverable 
furthermore  there is little risk of loss on advances because they are the first obligations to be satisfied when a securitization trust disburses the funds that it has collected 
the  increase in advances on loans serviced for others during primarily reflects the growth in the residential servicing portfolio 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the composition of advances 
match funded advances 
match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to special purpose entities spes in exchange for cash 
these transfers have been made under the terms of two match funded advance financing agreements  as amended 
under one of the agreements  we retain effective control of the advances  and the transfers do not qualify for sales accounting treatment 
under the second agreement  the transfers qualify for sales accounting treatment  but the spe to which the advances are transferred is not a qualifying spe under sfas no 
as a result  we include the spe in our consolidated financial statements 
the match funded advances are owned by the spes and are not available to satisfy general claims of our creditors 
the  increase in match funded advances during was primarily the result of growth in the residential loan servicing portfolio and the  increase in our available borrowing capacity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the composition of match funded advances 
msrs 
the unamortized balance of msrs is primarily related to subprime residential loans 
our investment increased by  during as the amount of servicing rights purchased and retained exceeded amortization for the year 
balance at beginning of year purchases retained from the securitization of loans amortization balance at end of year we purchase servicing rights from the owners of the mortgages and have also retained them in connection with the securitization of our own loans 
at december   we serviced loans under servicing agreements for investors 
this compares to servicing agreements for investors at december  match funded liabilities 
match funded liabilities are obligations secured by the collateral underlying the related match funded assets and are repaid through the cash proceeds arising from those assets 
we account for and report match funded liabilities as secured borrowings with pledges of collateral 
as of december  and  all of our match funded liabilities were secured by advances on loans serviced for others 
the  increase in match funded liabilities during was the result of an increase in borrowing capacity under one of our two match funded facilities through the issuance of a  fixed rate term note in december 
we also increased from  to  our borrowing under the variable funding note issued through the same facility 
offsetting these increases  borrowing under our second  more costly match funded facility declined from  to  during the year 
the issuance of the term note increased our maximum borrowing capacity under match funded facilities to  at december   as compared to  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the terms and balances of our match funded liabilities 
servicer liabilities 
servicer liabilities represent amounts we have collected  primarily from residential servicing borrowers that will be deposited in custodial accounts and excluded from our balance sheet  paid directly to an investment trust or refunded to borrowers 
the balances at december  and consisted primarily of borrower payments due to custodial accounts  and the  increase in servicer liabilities during was largely the result of an increase in such amounts due 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the principal components of servicer liabilities 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
during the third quarter of  we negotiated amendments to our senior secured credit agreement to extend its maturity to august and to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from  to  during the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a further increase in the maximum borrowing capacity to  borrowings under this agreement may be secured by msrs  advances on loans serviced for others  receivables and mortgage loans 
the  increase in the amount outstanding under this facility during reflects the increase in borrowing capacity  which was used to fund the increases in our investment in these assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the terms and balances of our lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
comparative selected operations data is as follows pre tax income revenue servicing and subservicing fees process management fees other total revenue operating expenses compensation and benefits amortization of servicing rights servicing and origination technology and communications professional services occupancy and equipment other total operating expenses other income expense interest income interest expense other total other income expense servicing and subservicing fees 
the principal components of servicing and subservicing fees are provided in the table below  for the years indicated servicing fees float earnings late charges prepayment and collection related fees other fees the increase in servicing fees in as compared to was primarily due to a increase in the average balance of loans serviced 
the increase in the average balance of loans serviced was due to an increase in the acquisitions of loan servicing and a reduced run off of the existing portfolio due to slower prepayment speeds 
mortgage prepayment speeds for averaged  as compared to an average of for and for the decline in mortgage prepayment speeds was largely due to rising mortgage interest rates and a leveling off of the gains in housing values 
increases in short term interest rates have had a positive impact on float earnings in and the increase in float earnings due to higher interest rates has been partially offset by a decline in the average balance of custodial account balances 
the decline in the average balance of these accounts reflects a decline in mortgage prepayment speeds offset in part by the growth in the servicing portfolio 
funds that we have received from borrowers are held in custodial accounts until remitted to investors 
these custodial accounts are excluded from our balance sheet 
the following table summarizes information regarding float earnings average custodial account balances float earnings yield the underlying servicing agreements restrict the investment of float balances to certain types of instruments 
we are responsible for any losses incurred on the investment of these funds 
compensation and benefits expense 
the decrease in compensation expense and benefits in and has occurred primarily due to a decline in the average number of employees in the us because of cost reduction initiatives put in place in  including a greater utilization of the lower cost workforce in india 
although average employment in india has increased  total average employment declined  and the ratio of india employment to total employment increased 
average employment in the residential servicing segment for the last three years is as follows india united states amortization of servicing rights 
amortization expense for of  represents an increase of  as compared to amortization in of  this increase was due to an increase in our investment in msrs  offset in part by a reduction in the rate of amortization due to slower mortgage prepayment speeds 
although the average balance of msrs increased by in as compared to  amortization expense for increased by only 
during and most of  mortgage prepayment speeds remained high  resulting in increased amortization as compared to servicing and origination expenses 
the principal components of servicing and origination expenses are compensating interest satisfaction expense other the decline in compensating interest expense reflects slower prepayment speeds offset in part by the growth in the average size of the servicing portfolio 
in addition  there has been a shift towards a higher percentage of loans serviced under a mid month structure versus a calendar month structure 
under a calendar month structure  compensating interest is paid to the securitization trust for a full month of interest on all loans that prepay during the month  whereas under a mid month structure  we are not obligated to pay the compensating interest on prepayments that occur during the first half of the month 
professional services expenses 
professional services expense for includes a provision of  recorded to increase litigation accruals related to ongoing cases 
this increase in litigation accruals is primarily related to settlements in principle that were reached with the law firms representing plaintiff borrowers in a number of filed and threatened cases challenging various loan servicing fees  primarily in the states of alabama and mississippi 
none of these cases sought class certification  although of them had been consolidated in the mdl proceeding 
essentially  all of the settlements in principle have since been reduced to definitive settlement and release agreements separately entered into with each of the individual plaintiff borrowers involved 
professional services in includes  to provide for current and pending litigation  including  for a judgment in a wrongful foreclosure case

the unrealized losses on the uk residuals in were offset by unrealized gains of  on subordinate and residual securities acquired or retained in connection with securitization transactions 
in both june and june  we purchased unrated residual securities related to loans for which we were already the master servicer for the securitizations 
as the master servicer  we had the right to collapse the related trusts once the balance of the underlying loans outstanding reached the optional termination amount of of the original amount of loans in the securitization 
in the third quarter of both and  we exercised our call rights and purchased the remaining loans from the trusts 
as a result  the over collateralization was remitted to us  and we realized gains on the residual securities that we had purchased of  and  in and  respectively 
we purchased the loans  which we classified as loans held for resale  with the intention of securitizing or selling them 
a portion of the loans that we acquired were nonperforming  and we recorded provisions of  and  in and  respectively  to reduce these nonperforming loans to their market value

the gain on sale that we report represents the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
in connection with these securitizations  we retained msrs and residual securities 
net losses on sales of loans related to our subprime origination activities amounted to  for during  funding america sold to third parties loans with an upb of  under the loan purchase agreements  we may be required to repurchase loans that become nonperforming within a certain period after the date of the sale 
during the fourth quarter of  as an alternative to repurchasing certain loans under this obligation  we agreed to a pricing adjustment on the loans sold  which resulted in our recording a loss on loans held for resale of  in addition  we recorded a reserve of  to provide for estimated market value adjustments on other loans that we may be obligated to repurchase

deferred tax assets  net 
the  increase in net deferred tax assets in was primarily due to the reversal of  of valuation allowances  including  during the second quarter 
we recorded this reversal as an income tax benefit 
based on our cumulative earnings in recent periods and a more stable outlook for future taxable income  we determined that it was appropriate to reverse this portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in future periods 
deferred tax assets are net of valuation allowances totaling and  at december  and  respectively

stockholder s equity stockholders equity amounted to  at december   as compared to  at december  the  increase in stockholders equity during was primarily due to net income of  and the issuance of  shares of common stock to employees as a result of the exercise of stock options and the vesting of stock awards  largely offset by the repurchase of  shares for  income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was   and  for  and  respectively 
the tax benefit primarily reflects the reversal of  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  including  in the second quarter  in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
the  decrease in the valuation allowances during included the  of reversals and  of expired capital loss carryforwards 
we base the amount of the valuation allowance on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits are also considered 
we assess the amount of our valuation allowance each quarter 
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance  we primarily based our determination that it was appropriate to reverse  on the following cumulative taxable earnings in recent periods  positive outlook for future taxable earnings  the disposal of nearly all of our non core assets 
the tax benefit of  was primarily due to a  reduction in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets as a result of refund claims of  filed with the irs that reduced our gross deferred tax asset and increased our income tax receivable balance by the same amount 
these refund claims  which were affirmed in writing by the irs during and collected in  arose because of changes in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses from and to taxes paid in earlier years 
excluding the effect of the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the provision for the recapture of bad debt reserves  our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit on income before income taxes differs from amounts that would be computed by applying the federal corporate income tax rate of primarily because of the effect of foreign taxes  foreign income with an indefinite deferral from us taxation  losses from consolidated vies  state taxes  changes in the valuation allowance and low income housing tax credits

our funding requirements related to loan originations will diminish considerably in as we have decided to close our subprime loan origination business 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements  and we invest available funds in short term investment grade securities

we also had  of investment grade securities at december   none of which were pledged to support borrowings 
total cash and investment grade securities comprised of total assets at december  under certain of our credit facilities  we are required to maintain minimum liquidity levels 
among the risks and challenges associated with our funding activities are the following cash requirements to fund our acquisition of additional servicing rights and related advances and to fund existing operations 
the maturity of existing credit agreements at various dates through october  subject to the renewals of these agreements 
we had an aggregate balance of  outstanding under these agreements at december  during  we increased our overall borrowing capacity on existing credit facilities from  at december  to  at december  we also expanded the assets eligible for financing to include additional msrs coverage and various components of our receivable balances

although the outstanding balance is less than the maximum borrowing capacity  the actual borrowed amount is  and thus there is no available capacity at december  the reported outstanding balance is less than the actual amount borrowed because the  term note issued in is carried on the balance sheet at fair value as the result of a designated fair value hedging relationship that we established through the use of an interest rate swap 
in january  we negotiated an extension of the maturity of this facility to january this agreement has no stated credit limit 
lending is determined for each transaction based on the acceptability of the securities presented as collateral 
we grow our residential servicing business primarily through the purchase of servicing rights or by entering into subservicing agreements 
servicing rights entitle us to earn servicing fees and other types of ancillary income  but they also impose on us various obligations as the servicer 
among these are the obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest payments for certain investors and to pay taxes  insurance and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced 
our ability to expand our residential servicing business depends in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to purchase new servicing rights and to fund servicing advances 
we currently use a variety of sources of debt to finance these assets  including match funded agreements and secured credit facilities 
our credit facilities provide financing to us at amounts that are less than the full value of the related servicing assets that serve as collateral for the credit facilities 
if we cannot replace or renew these sources as they mature or obtain additional sources of financing  we may be unable to acquire new servicing rights or make the associated advances 
during  we negotiated increases in the size of two of our residential servicing credit facilities 
we increased the size of our secured line of credit from  to  and we increased the size of the larger of our two match funded credit facilities from  to  through the issuance of a  fixed rate term note 
we also extended the revolving period of the  variable funding note under this match funded credit facility to november in january  we negotiated a decrease in the interest rate on borrowings by basis points to month libor plus basis points and a decrease in the maximum borrowing from  to  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including internally generated funds  will be adequate to fund planned activities  although there can be no assurances in this regard

the decline in deposits in resulted from maturing certificates of deposit and the cash payment to marathon in connection with its assumption of our customer deposits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands market risk includes prepayment risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and liquidity risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or different bases  than our interest earning assets 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations and to the extent our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of trading securities  msrs and in the value of the collateral underlying loans 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support the residential servicing business including the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources including secured lines of credit  match funded agreements and repurchase agreements 
the primary risk associated with residential msrs is that they will lose a portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates or rapidly increasing housing prices 
interest rates  prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans significantly affect both our initial and ongoing valuations and the rate of amortization of msrs 
as of december   the carrying value and estimated fair value of our residential msrs were  and  respectively 
our residential servicing business is characterized by non interest earning assets financed by interest bearing liabilities 
among the more significant non interest earning assets are servicing advances and msrs 
at december   we had servicing advances of  consisting of advances on loans serviced for others of  and match funded advances on loans serviced for others of we are also exposed to interest rate risk because earnings on float balances are affected by short term interest rates 
these float balances  which are not included in our financial statements  amounted to  at december  we report these earnings as a component of servicing and subservicing fees 
partially offsetting this risk is the fact that a large component of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
therefore  declining rates will also reduce our interest expense for that financing 
we have also entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our float earnings against the effects of declining interest rates 
at december   the combined balance of our match funded liabilities  debt securities  lines of credit and other secured borrowings totaled  of this amount  or  was variable rate debt  for which debt service costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates  and  was fixed rate debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the interest rate on  of our fixed rate debt to variable 
our balance sheet at december  included interest earning assets totaling  including  of loans held for resale and  of investment grade securities 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our msrs portfolio every quarter 
we currently estimate that the fair value of the portfolio increases or decreases by approximately and  respectively  for every basis point increase or decline in interest rates 
this sensitivity analysis is limited in that it was performed at a particular point in time  only contemplates certain movements in interest rates  does not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility  is subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and does not incorporate other factors that would impact our overall financial performance in such scenarios 
we carry msrs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value by strata 
to the extent that fair value were to decline below amortized cost  we would record a charge to earnings and establish a valuation allowance 
a subsequent increase in fair value could result in the recovery of some or all of a previously established valuation allowance 
however  an increase in fair value of a particular stratum above its amortized cost would not be reflected in current earnings 
for these reasons  this interest rate sensitivity estimate should not be viewed as an earnings forecast

these techniques include interest rate exchange contracts or swap agreements  interest rate caps and floors  us treasury interest rate futures contracts  eurodollar futures contracts  foreign currency futures contracts  foreign currency forwards and european swaptions and put options 
we have entered into foreign currency futures to hedge our net investment in the foreign subsidiary that owns the uk residuals 
the notional amount of these futures was   at december  our principal exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the british pound versus the us dollar
