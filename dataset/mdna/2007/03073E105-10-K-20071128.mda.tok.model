table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue of billion in fiscal  which excludes bulk deliveries  increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increases in operating revenue in our abdc and absg operating segments  both of which are included in the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment 
our acquisitions contributed of the operating revenue growth in fiscal the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer  and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites ie  drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites ie  cross dock shipment 
bulk deliveries of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the company s largest bulk customer 
the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased  and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products  whether the products are drop shipped or shipped cross dock 
the company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer 
as a result  and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 
gross profit of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue  an increase in compensation under its fee for service agreements and the growth of its generic programs  offset in part by a million charge incurred by absg relating to tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory and the decline in gross profit of the other segment 
during fiscal and  the company recognized gains of million and million  respectively  from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers

distribution  selling and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization dsad a of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth  operating expenses of our recently acquired companies  an increase in bad debt expense of million and an increase in share based compensation of million  all of which was partially offset by a decline in dsad a of the other segment  and a decline in employee incentive compensation 
as a percentage of operating revenue  dsad a in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in dsad a of the other segment resulting from the divestiture of the long term care business 
in  the company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions 
the plan  which is complete  included building six new facilities  closing facilities and outsourcing a significant portion of its information technology activities 
to complete the plan  we closed two distribution facilities in fiscal and now have distribution facilities in the us as of september  the company closed six distribution facilities in each of fiscal and during fiscal  the company opened the last of its new distribution facilities and completed the outsourcing of a significant portion of its information technology activities

the decrease in invested cash and short term investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the company s billion of purchases of its common stock in fiscal  offset largely by billion of net cash provided by operating activities 
the company s net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in interest rates and strategic decisions made by the company to deploy its invested cash and short term investments 
income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of  versus in the prior fiscal year 
the tax rate for fiscal was greater than the tax rate for the prior fiscal year  which benefitted from more favorable tax adjustments than the current fiscal year and a larger portion of the company s invested cash in tax free investments 
the company expects to have an effective income tax rate between and in future periods  which will primarily depend on its mix of tax free and taxable investments  including cash and cash equivalents

table of contents segment information pharmaceutical distribution pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily driven by the strong  above market  operating revenue growth of absg  principally in its distribution businesses 
abdc grew its operating revenue by in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison with the prior year results  sales to institutional customers increased primarily due to the strong growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
sales to retail customers increased as growth in retail chain sales was offset  in part  by our decision to discontinue servicing the large lower margin customer discussed below 
the abdc operating revenue growth rate in fiscal benefited from increased sales to certain of its large customers and the revenue contribution resulting from the full year impact of its canadian acquisitions 
abdc s operating revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by the company s decision not to renew a contract  effective january  with a large  low margin customer that contributed approximately billion of operating revenue for abdc in fiscal and the july loss of two customer accounts that totaled billion of revenue in fiscal these customer accounts transitioned to another distributor after they were acquired by a company supplied by that distributor 
absg grew at a rate in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth 
absg s operating revenue of billion in fiscal grew from the prior fiscal year 
the majority of this group s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be absg s most significant contributor to revenue growth 
during fiscal  the oncology business benefited from a semi exclusive distribution agreement that it signed with a large biotechnology manufacturer during the second half of fiscal and absg s besse medical business experienced strong growth in fiscal primarily arising from the distribution of a new physician administered ophthalmology product  which was introduced in the second half of fiscal absg also distributes vaccines  plasma and other blood products 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes to this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 
approximately of the company s operating revenue in fiscal related to the distribution of anemia related products  which are distributed by both abdc and absg 
several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs during the second half of fiscal  including the decision in march by the us food and drug administration fda to require an expanded warning label on these drugs  cms s review of reimbursement policies for these drugs and restrictions on recommended dosage or use 
in july  cms issued new  more restrictive policies regarding medicare coverage of anemia drugs used in the treatment of oncology patients and for kidney failure and dialysis 
on november   the fda announced revised boxed warnings and other safety related product labeling changes for these drugs addressing the risks posed to patients with cancer or chronic kidney failure 
cms also has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future 
further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payers  including federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
the company s future operating revenue growth rate and or profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs 
see part i  item a 
risk factors on page 
the company currently expects that its operating revenue growth in fiscal will range from to  including a contribution from its acquisition of bellco 
abdc revenues are expected to grow with the overall pharmaceutical market growth rate and absg revenues are expected to be flat to down from fiscal 
table of contents primarily as a result of declining anemia drug sales and due to one of its customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october the former customer contributed approximately million to absg s operating revenue in fiscal abdc s and absg s future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors 
these factors include competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates  changes in federal government rules and regulations  and industry growth trends  such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers 
this segment s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization  the introduction of new products  and higher pharmaceutical prices offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
the segment s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry sales in the united states  as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc ims  are expected to grow between and in and between and per year over the next five years 
ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market  such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of  million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue  an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements  and the growth of our generic programs  offset in part by competitive pricing pressures and absg s million charge relating to the write down of tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note of the consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in fiscal was flat compared to fiscal the company s cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
during fiscal  inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year 
the effect of the liquidation in fiscal was to decrease cost of goods sold by million 
pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of  million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth  operating expenses of our recently acquired companies  an increase in bad debt expense of million primarily related to the recent bankruptcy of a retail chain customer in our west region and an increase in share based compensation  and was partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year due to economies of scale realized as a result of the increase in operating revenue  productivity gains achieved throughout the company s distribution network as a result of our optimiz program and a decrease in employee incentive compensation  and was partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense and the operating costs of our recently acquired companies 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year as the increase in gross profit exceeded the increase in operating expenses 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in fiscal increased basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the improvement in the operating expense margin 
other as previously noted  the operating results of the other segment in fiscal includes the operating results of long term care only for the ten months ended july  due to the divestiture  and the operating results of pmsi for the full fiscal year ended september  therefore  the fiscal results of operations of the other segment is not comparable to fiscal results 

table of contents long term care long term care s operating revenue decreased from the prior fiscal year due to the divestiture  effective july   as discussed above 
long term care s gross profit  operating expenses and operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal were relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year 
pmsi pmsi operating revenue of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the net result of the additional revenues of million or from the acquisition of pmsi msa services  which was partially offset by a decline in pmsi s business due to competitive pressures 
in particular  the loss of one customer in fiscal substantially contributed to the decline of pmsi s business 
pmsi s operating revenue in fiscal is expected to be flat to down due to the loss of certain customers and will likely continue to be impacted significantly by competitive pressures 
operating revenue is also likely to be impacted in the future by the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 
pmsi gross profit of million in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
these declines were primarily due to the aforementioned customer loss and continuing industry competitive pressures surrounding pricing  which were partially offset by the additional million gross profit contribution made by pmsi msa services 
future gross profit will likely be impacted by industry competitive pressures and continued downward pressure on rates of reimbursement for services provided 
pmsi operating expenses of million in fiscal increased or million from the prior fiscal year due to the additional million of operating expenses of the pmsi msa services business  additional costs incurred relating to customer initiatives  investments in information technology infrastructure  and an increase in bad debt expense 
bad debt expense in fiscal increased by million  with the prior fiscal year having benefitted from significant bad debt recoveries made as a result of improvements made in credit and cash application management procedures 
additionally  pmsi operating expenses in the prior fiscal year benefitted from a million reduction in sales tax liabilities 
pmsi operating income of million in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in its operating expenses and to a lesser extent  a decline in its gross profit 
we expect the operating income of pmsi in fiscal to be flat to down when compared to fiscal due to customer losses and continuing costs relating to customer initiatives and investments in its information technology infrastructure

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  the company considers a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  its customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables 
each of the company s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
the company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the 
table of contents allowance at least quarterly and the company s largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september   and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments

supplier reserves the company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the company 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the company 
the company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances

loss contingencies the company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures

table of contents business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  non compete agreements  patents and software technology  are amortized over their useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas no 
 a determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of the company s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
the company s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the company s future financial results 
the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal and did not record any significant impairment charges as a result of the tests 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of abdc due to the existence of impairment indicators 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million relating to certain of those intangible assets 
the charge was reflected in the company s results of operations in fiscal share based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  and  therefore  began to expense the fair value of all options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to september  over their requisite service periods 
the company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of 
table of contents the option  future volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 
income taxes the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and income tax reserves reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  the company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
in addition  the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
 accounting for uncertainties 
the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  the company s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period 
the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of the company s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments 
in all cases  the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of the company s assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in the company s effective tax rate by on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal
