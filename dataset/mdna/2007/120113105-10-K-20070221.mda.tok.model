item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in item of form k as well as the caption under this item entitled business risks and forward looking statements 
business environment and executive overview we are one of the largest providers of residential construction services and building products in the united states  with a focus in the western and southern states 
we provide construction services and building products in of the top single family residential construction markets through our two subsidiaries  selectbuild and bmc west 
selectbuild provides construction services to high volume homebuilders in key growth markets 
bmc west markets and sells building products  manufactures building components and provides construction services to professional builders and contractors through a network of distribution facilities and manufacturing facilities 
we have increasingly focused on providing construction services and manufactured building components to our customers 
new home construction was sharply down in the us census bureau reported single family housing starts fell to million units in as compared to the historic high of million units in single family housing starts in are expected to decline to million units according to the national association of home builders 
the housing market is currently adjusting an oversupply of inventory by offering buyers incentives to purchase existing inventory and by severely restricting the construction of new homes 
our markets for new residential construction and building products have also been dramatically impacted by the national slowdown in homebuilding 
across all our markets and particularly during the second half of  we experienced substantial declines in housing starts and building permits 
to counter the effects of the downturn  we have reduced our labor force by more than  decreased variable expenses and focused our efforts to reduce costs by leveraging our scale and shared resources 
the overall economic backdrop that historically has supported the homebuilding industry  such as the condition of the us economy  interest rates  job formation and consumer confidence  remain favorable 
we believe that the excess inventory of new homes will be gradually absorbed on a market by market basis over the next several quarters 
our operations are located in attractive metropolitan areas that have historically outpaced us averages for residential building permit activity 
with construction services and building products offered in california  texas  nevada  arizona  florida  the northwest and intermountain states  illinois  and virginia  we believe we are in homebuilding markets supported by positive long term population growth  household formation and demographic trends 
we grow our business through acquisitions as well as strategically expanding the breadth of our construction services and building products offered to high volume homebuilders and other professional builders and contractors 
in particular  we believe high volume homebuilders are seeking quality  reliable and cost effective solutions to meet their construction services needs 
our services include framing  concrete  plumbing and other construction services as well as building product distribution and manufactured building components including trusses  millwork and wall panels 
in  we completed several acquisitions to expand the trades offered to homebuilders 

table of contents acquisition history over the past few years  selectbuild acquired businesses providing construction services to high volume homebuilders 
specifically  these businesses were as follows distribution services in southern california remaining interest in our existing business providing concrete services in arizona window installation services in phoenix  arizona framing services in southern california concrete services in northern arizona wall panel and truss manufacturer in palm springs  california remaining interest in our existing business providing concrete block masonry and concrete services in florida framing services in palm springs  california and reno  nevada framing services in san diego  california concrete and plumbing services in las vegas  nevada and southern california additional interest in our existing business providing concrete block masonry and concrete services in florida initial purchase of january interest in concrete services in arizona interest in plumbing services in phoenix and tucson  arizona stucco services in las vegas  nevada interest in framing services in chicago  illinois window installation services in napa  california interest in a truss manufacturer in fort pierce  florida remaining interest in our existing framing services business in northern california initial purchase of july distribution services in tucson  arizona at bmc west  we are expanding our building products  manufactured building components  millwork and construction services to become a full service provider to homebuilders 
to facilitate this expansion in products and services  bmc west acquired building materials distribution and truss manufacturing in eastern idaho building materials distribution and millwork services in houston  texas truss manufacturer in mccall  idaho 
table of contents framing services in denver  colorado as part of our growth strategy  we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that strengthen and broaden our construction services and building products as well as our presence in attractive markets 
performance measurements we measure our operating performance and financial condition based on several factors including sales management of working capital income from operations return on investment we evaluate our results of operations including and excluding acquisitions not present in comparable periods 
we believe this approach enhances an understanding of our acquisitions and operating results for the respective reporting periods 
the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition provides information to assist the reader in understanding our financial statements  changes in key items in those financial statements and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
the discussion of our consolidated financial results is followed by a more detailed review of our business segments 
results of operations compared with the following table sets forth the amounts and percentage relationship to sales of certain costs  expenses and income items millions year ended december sales construction services building products total sales costs and operating expenses cost of goods sold construction services building products total cost of goods sold impairment of assets selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net total costs and operating expenses income from operations interest expense income taxes minority interest income  net of income taxes net income earnings per diluted share 
table of contents consolidated financial results selected financial results are as follows millions change change sales construction services building products income from operations a key element of our business strategy for the past several years entails shifting our sales mix to construction services and value added manufactured building components from commodity wood products 
we continue to pursue this shift to leverage our competitive advantages and improve our financial performance 
sales of billion increased million or 
sales from acquisitions not present in the prior period were million and were partially offset by a decrease in sales from comparable operations of million 
the decrease in sales from comparable operations reflects a sharp decline in both housing starts and building permits in the second half of the year  indicative of a nationwide contraction in homebuilding 
according to the us census bureau  single family building permits in our markets were down relative to their historic high in income from operations of million decreased million or from million in the prior year 
for comparable operations  income from operations declined million or 
the decrease in income from operations was principally due to lower sales from comparable operations as well as higher selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million from a year ago 
acquisitions not present in the prior period were million or approximately of the increase 
these expenses for comparable operations were higher due to compensation  including the impact of adopting a new accounting principle for share based compensation  occupancy expenses to support growth and acquisition integration expenses 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were from a year ago  up 
the increase in these expenses as a percent of sales  was due to deflation in selling prices  delivery costs to support higher volume and fixed amortization expenses from acquisitions 
although gross margins improved for construction services and building products  they were overall compared to in the decrease in gross margins was due to a higher portion of sales from construction services relative to building products 
interest expense interest expense of million was up million from the prior year 
the increase was due to greater average borrowings of million in compared to million in and higher average interest rates of in compared to in income taxes in our combined federal and state income tax rate decreased to from in the reduction was due to a refinement of the apportioned taxable income to the states in which we operate 
business segments sales and operating income by business segment are as follows millions sales income from operations sales income from operations selectbuild bmc west corporate selectbuild selected financial results are as follows millions change change sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions

the increase was due to million in sales from acquisitions not present in the prior period 
sales from comparable operations declined or million and were particularly weak in our southwest and pacific regions 
reflective of the reduction in homebuilding in our markets  both starts and building permits were down sharply 
income from operations decreased to million from million 
for comparable operations  income from operations was down or million 
gross margins were slightly improved at of sales from a year ago  however selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales compared to in these expenses were higher due to reduced operating leverage resulting from a decline in sales from comparable operations  compensation and integration expenses associated with a regional operating structure and operating expenses and non cash amortization associated with recent acquisitions 
bmc west selected financial results are as follows millions change change sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions sales of billion were approximately the same as sales from comparable operations experienced a decrease in commodity wood product prices and were down or million from a year ago 
strong sales in the intermountain and texas regions were offset by lower sales in our southwest  colorado and northwest regions 
indicative of slower homebuilding activity  single family building permits declined in the second half of the year and were down from a year ago 
income from operations decreased to million from million 
as a percent of sales  gross margins were up basis points over the prior year 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased to primary due to year over year deflation in commodity wood product prices 
total dollars spent in selling  general and administrative expenses were up million as a result of compensation expenses for additional personnel to support increased sales volume  expenses from acquisitions not present in the prior period and higher delivery and occupancy expenses 
corporate corporate represents expenses to support the operations of our business segments  selectbuild and bmc west 
these costs include administrative functions for information systems  reporting  accounts payable and human resources  executive and senior management  professional fees for regulatory compliance and certain incentive compensation as well as actuarial adjustments for insurance and medical claims 
these costs are not allocated to our business segments 

table of contents selected financial results are as follows millions change change operating expenses corporate expenses increased to million from million a year ago 
higher compensation including the non cash impact of share based compensation from the adoption of a new accounting standard  was partially offset by lower performance based incentive compensation and actuarial adjustments for insurance expense

building permits and housing starts were also higher in most of our markets relative to the prior year 
income from operations for increased to million from million in the prior year 
improved margins  particularly from demand for our construction services  were a key factor 
margins as a percent of sales for construction services were up while building products also improved compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales and improved by basis points 
these expenses were lower as a percent of sales due to better leveraging of these expenses at our building products operations

income from operations for improved over million compared to the prior year 
margin improvement was a key factor  improving as a percent of sales to compared to in the prior year 
further market acceptance of the value of our construction services  particularly in the las vegas and phoenix markets as well as improved management of contracts  most notably in our florida operations  contributed to the improvement 
acquisitions also contributed approximately or million to the increase in operating income

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows our primary need for capital resources is to fund working capital and acquisitions as well as finance capital expenditures 
we expect to fund these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and seasonal borrowings under our credit facility 
for  cash provided by operations was million and funded the majority of acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments in marketable securities 
the sections that follow discuss in more detail our operating  investing and financing activities as well as our financing arrangements 
operations cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million a year ago 
net income adjusted for non cash items decreased million due to slower construction activity as homebuilders curtailed production in an effort to align home inventory levels with demand 
however  changes in working capital were favorable as requirements were million less than a year ago as cash provided from accounts receivable and unbilled receivables as well as improved inventory turns were partially offset by cash used for compensation  accounts payable and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  a significant increase from million in strong home construction activity and improved margins in both our construction services and building products segments resulted in higher net income  providing million of additional operating cash flow over also  working capital requirements were lower in than due to lower commodity wood product prices as well as improved inventory turns and days sales outstanding 
this improved management of working capital resulted in cash used of million compared to million of cash used in cash provided by operating activities was million in  up significantly from million in strong home construction activity and our strategy to provide additional construction services resulted in higher net income  providing million of additional operating cash flow 
net income adjusted for non cash items was million however  changes in working capital requirements used million of this cash flow 
capital investment and acquisitions cash used in investing activities was million in or million more than million used in investing activities a year ago

the cash use was partially offset by proceeds of million from the disposition of properties in montana  texas and utah 
financing cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to million a year ago 
after cash provided by operating activities  debt was borrowed to complete eight acquisitions and purchase an additional interest in concrete block masonry and concrete services business as well as expand our facilities and information systems 
in november  we amended our revolver and entered into a new million term note 
this transaction resulted in proceeds from the million term note which was used to repay our previous term notes and the amount outstanding under the revolver 
remaining borrowings were used to pay dividends and invest in cash equivalents

the revolver matures in november the revolver consists of both libor and prime based borrowings 
these variable interest rates are subject to quarterly adjustment based on operating performance and range from libor plus to  or prime plus to 
interest is paid quarterly 
as of december   no amount was outstanding under the revolver 

table of contents term note in november  we entered into a million term note with a group of lenders

the credit facility may be increased an aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit facility is collateralized by tangible and intangible property of our wholly owned subsidiaries  except the assets of our captive insurance subsidiary 
the credit facility contains covenants and conditions requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants and conditions 
scheduled maturities of long term debt are as follows thousands thereafter as of december  and december  there were million and million  respectively of letters of credit outstanding that guaranteed performance or payment to third parties 
these letters of credit reduce borrowing availability under the revolver 
hedging activities derivative and hedging activities are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
in november  we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert million of the variable rate borrowings of the million term note to a fixed interest rate of through november  thus reducing the impact of increases in interest rates on future interest expense 
approximately of the outstanding variable rate borrowings of the term note as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings were fixed and variable 

table of contents the fair value of derivative instruments is based on pricing models using current market rates 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a long term liability of million as of december  the effective portion was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net  a separate component of shareholders equity  and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item  interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
a corresponding deferred tax asset of million was also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net for the income tax related to the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap contracts 
the ineffective portion of the change in the value of the interest rate swap contracts is immediately recognized as a component of interest expense 
hedge ineffectiveness for the period ended december  was not significant 
management may choose not to swap variable rates to fixed rates or may terminate a previously executed swap if the variable rate positions are more beneficial 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to a fixed interest rate 
these swaps were settled in november and the million gain recognized for this settlement was reclassified to other income  net from accumulated other comprehensive income  net 
equity on february   our board of directors approved a two for one split of our outstanding common shares 
shareholders of record as of february  received a stock dividend of one additional common share for every common share they owned 
all share and per share information for all periods presented has been adjusted to reflect this share split 
at the annual meeting of shareholders on may   our shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares to million from million 
these additional shares may be issued for reasons including but not limited to stock splits  financing acquisitions  establishing strategic relationships with corporate partners and providing equity incentives 
in the third quarter of  we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission to register million common shares 
we may issue these shares in connection with future business acquisitions  combinations or mergers 
shares have been issued from this registration statement for a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions 
there are approximately million shares remaining and available under this shelf registration 
based on our historical ability to generate cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under the credit facility and access to debt and equity markets  management believes it will have sufficient capital to meet anticipated needs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which might be established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

under the purchase agreements  we have the right to purchase the remaining portions during certain periods or if certain conditions are met 
likewise  the other owners have the option to require us to purchase the remaining portions during certain periods 
the purchase price for the remaining portions will be based generally on a multiple of historical earnings 
as part of our revolver  we have million in letters of credit outstanding principally for the deductible portion of automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
these obligations are not required to be recorded on our balance sheet and renew automatically on their various anniversary dates or until released by their respective beneficiaries 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk prices of commodity wood products  which are subject to significant volatility  may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge commodity wood product prices

after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings are fixed and variable 
based on debt outstanding as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually 
critical accounting estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions include critical accounting estimates which are defined by the securities and exchange commission as those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these estimates require management s subjective and complex judgments often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we review the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the estimates utilized are reasonable under the circumstances  however actual results could differ from these estimates and may require adjustment in future periods 
our critical accounting estimates are revenue recognition for construction services the percentage of completion method is used to recognize revenue for construction services 
periodic estimates of our progress towards completion are made based on a comparison of labor costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs for labor 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of various estimates  including among others  the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract completion costs 
contract revenues and contract costs to be recognized are dependent on the accuracy of estimates  including quantities of materials  labor productivity and other cost estimates 
we have a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
revisions of contract revenues and cost estimates as well as provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period such revisions are known 
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates are established by assessing estimated costs to complete  change orders and claims for uncompleted contracts 
revisions of estimated losses are recognized in the period such revisions are known 
at december   the reserve for these estimated losses was million for selectbuild and less than million for bmc west 
these reserves are established by assessing estimated costs to complete  change orders and claims 
assumptions for estimated costs to complete include material prices  labor costs  labor productivity and contract claims 
such estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from these estimates 
we have a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair values of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
an annual assessment for impairment is completed in the fourth quarter and whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is more than the estimated future operating cash flows as measured by fair value techniques 
at december   goodwill was million for selectbuild and million for bmc west 
the impairment assessment includes determining the estimated fair value of reporting units based on discounting the future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our estimated average cost of funds 
future operating cash flows are derived from our budget information  which includes assumptions of future volumes  pricing of commodity products and labor costs 
prices for commodity products are inherently volatile 
due to the variables associated with prices of commodity products and the effects of changes in circumstances  both the precision and reliability of the estimates of future operating cash flows are subject to uncertainty 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
insurance deductible reserves the estimated cost of automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is determined by actuarial methods 
claims in excess of insurance deductibles are insured with third party insurance carriers 
reserves for claims are recognized based on the estimated costs of these claims as limited by deductibles of the applicable insurance policies 
revisions of estimated claims are recognized in the period such revisions are known 
at december   the reserve for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims was million 
the actuarial assessment includes determining the estimated cost of claims 
the reserve for these claims is susceptible to change based on the estimated cost of the claims 
actual loss experience substantially different than the actuarial assumptions may occur 
future reserves are subject to the nature and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation and changes in the insurance deductibles of the applicable insurance policies 
warranties the estimated cost of warranties for certain construction services is based on the nature and frequency of claims  anticipated claims and cost per claim 
claims in excess of insurance deductibles are insured with third party insurance carriers 
estimated costs for warranties are recognized when the revenue associated with the service is recognized 
revisions of estimated warranties are recognized in the period such revisions are known 

table of contents at december   the reserve for warranties was million 
specific terms and conditions for warranties vary from one year to ten years and are based on geographic market and state regulations 
the reserve for these claims is susceptible to change based on the estimated cost of the claim 
we have a history of making reasonable estimates of warranties 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual warranty costs may vary from estimates 
revisions of estimated warranties are recognized in the period such revisions are known 
share based compensation our estimates of the fair values of our share based payment transactions are based on the modified black scholes merton model 
in order to meet the fair value measurement objective  we are required to develop estimates regarding expected exercise patterns  share price volatility  forfeiture rates  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
these assumptions are based principally on historical experience 
when circumstances indicate the availability of new or different information that would be useful in estimating these assumptions  revisions will be made and recognized in the periods such revisions are known 
due to uncertainties inherent in these assumptions  it is possible that actual share based compensation may vary from this estimate 
recent accounting principles in september  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effect of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
this accounting principle provides specific guidance for considering the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements 
this accounting principle was adopted effective january and had no impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this accounting principle provides specific guidance for measurement  recognition and disclosure of uncertain tax positions 
this accounting principle was adopted january and is not expected to have a significant impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
