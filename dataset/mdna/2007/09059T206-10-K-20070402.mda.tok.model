each share of series e preferred stock is convertible into one share of bioject common stock 
the series e preferred stock includes an annual payment in kind dividend for months 
the difference between the fair value of the series e preferred stock of approximately million and the stated amount of million relates to accrued interest and preferred dividends  as well as the beneficial conversion on the issuance of series e preferred stock  which was recorded in the statement of operations as a component of interest expense and net loss allocable to common shareholders during the three month period ended june  in addition  on march   we entered into a term loan agreement with partners for growth  lp pfg for a million convertible debt financing the debt financing

in addition  if our common stock trades at a price of per share or higher for consecutive trading days  we can force pfg to convert the debt to common stock  subject to certain limitations on trading volume 
if we prepay this loan  we will issue pfg a warrant to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to what it would have received upon conversion at a price of per share 
as a result of the derivative accounting discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   this debt was recorded on our balance sheet at  and is being accreted on a straight line basis at the rate of approximately  per quarter to its face value of million over the month contractual term of the debt

new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues  inventory valuation  long lived asset impairment  stock based compensation  and fair value of derivative liabilities 
revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  product development revenue is recognized  to the extent of cash received  on a percentage of completion basis as qualifying expenditures are incurred 
licensing revenues  if separable  are recognized over the term of the license agreement 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf finalized eitf accounting for multiple element arrangements in november eitf requires arrangements with multiple elements to be broken out as separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only if the amount due can be reliably measured and the earnings process is substantially complete 
any units that can not be separated must be accounted for as a combined unit 
our accounting policy is consistent with eitf should agreements be terminated prior to completion  or our estimates of percentage of completion be incorrect  we could have unanticipated fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
amounts received prior to meeting recognition criteria are recorded on our balance sheet as deferred revenues and are recognized according to the terms of the associated agreements 
at december   deferred revenues totaled approximately million and included amounts received from merial  serono  an undisclosed european biotechnology company  hoffman la roche inc and trimeris inc  vical inc 
and an undisclosed pharmaceutical company 
inventory valuation we evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including the following historical and forecasted sales and usage rates  anticipated technology improvements and product upgrades  as well as other factors 
all inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices and if certain components have become obsolete 
we record valuation adjustments for inventory based on the above factors 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets and certain identified intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
based on these analyses  we recognized a  loss for the write down of our sterile fill equipment in the second quarter of and a  loss in the second quarter of and a  loss in related to the write down of assets held for sale to their estimated fair market value 
we did not recognize any other impairment on our long lived assets during the periods presented 
if circumstances related to our long lived assets change  we may record additional impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock and stock purchases related to our espp based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes valuation model  which has historically been used for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments and assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the actual amount of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
therefore  for both stock option awards and restricted stock awards  we have reduced the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures 
forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns 
we update our forfeiture estimates annually and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
fair value of derivative liabilities we recorded derivative liabilities in connection with our convertible debt and equity financing agreements entered into in derivative liabilities are presented at fair value each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of derivative liabilities is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value requires us to make judgments and assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility of the instrument over the expected term 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of derivative liabilities represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties 
changes in the fair value of these instruments could materially impact the results of operations in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and on our variable interest rate debt 
we mitigate the risk in our investment portfolio by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have outstanding variable rate convertible debt  a variable rate term loan and a variable rate line of credit agreement 
these debt obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in rates 
at december   we had million of convertible debt outstanding at an interest rate of   outstanding under our term loan at an interest rate of and  outstanding under the line of credit agreement at an interest rate of 
assuming the balances remained constant during  a increase in interest rates would result in an approximately  increase in interest expense in
