mti also co founded and retains a minority interest in plug power  inc plug power nasdaq plug  a developer of clean  reliable  on site energy products 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our micro fuel cell product development activities  ability to commercialize our micro fuel cell systems  market acceptance of our micro fuel cell systems and other factors 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic partnerships 
several key indicators of our liquidity are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital net loss net cash used in operating activities purchase of property  plant and equipment from inception through december   the company has incurred net losses of  thousand and expects to incur losses as it continues micro fuel cell product development and commercialization programs 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  sales of securities available for sale as well as the operating results of mti instruments and mti micro 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the company s most significant accounting policies 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  securities available for sale  income taxes  share based compensation and derivatives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form t he basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management reviews critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock and award restricted stock to our employees and directors under our equity incentive plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fas r  share based payment  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payments 
effective january   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of fas r with the modified prospective application  which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of fas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
share based compensation expense recognized under fas r for the year ended december  was  thousand 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested awards granted prior to that date was  thousand  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of share based awards on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the value of each share based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under fas the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r during future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under fas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the intrinsic values realized upon the exercise  expiration  cancellation or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and expensed in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and expensed in our financial statements 
there is currently neither a market based mechanism nor other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor a way to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with fas r and sab using a qualified option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in fas r and sab is still relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december  using the black scholes model  we used the historical volatility of our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the black scholes model  consistent with the guidance in fas r and sab the risk free interest rate is based on the risk free zero coupon rate for a period consistent with the expected option term at the time of grant 
we do not currently pay nor do we anticipate paying dividends  but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the black scholes model 
as such  we use a zero dividend rate 
the expected option term is estimated using both historical term measures and projected termination estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from development contracts based upon the relationship of actual costs to estimated costs to complete the contract 
these types of contracts typically provide development services to achieve a specific scientific result relating to dmfc technology 
some of these contracts require the company to contribute to the development effort 
the customers for these contracts are both commercial customers and various state and federal government agencies 
while government agencies are providing revenue  we do not expect the government to be a significant end user of the resulting products 
therefore  the company does not reduce funded research and product development expense by the funding received 
when it appears probable that estimated costs will exceed available funding on fixed price contracts  and the company is not successful in securing additional funding  the company records the estimated additional expense before it is incurred 
the company had a thousand accrual for contract losses for the year ended december  the company applies the guidance in sab no 
 revenue recognition  in the evaluation of commercially funded fuel cell research and prototype agreements in order to determine when to properly recognize income 
payments received in connection with commercial research and prototype agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement for service related payments  and for milestone and prototype delivery payments  if and when achieved  revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the agreement 
when revenue qualifies for recognition it will be recorded as funded research and development revenue 
the costs associated with research and prototype producing activities are expensed as incurred 
expenses in an amount equal to revenues recognized are reclassified from unfunded research and product development to funded research and product development 
the company also recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with sab no 
product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product to the customer or distributor has occurred  at which time title generally is passed to the customer or distributor  and the company has determined that collection of a fixed fee is probable  all of which occur upon shipment of the product 
if the product requires installation to be performed by the company  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as based on historical usage 
demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
included in this assessment is the determination of net operating loss carry forwards 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset 
the company must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses being carried forward 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the recorded valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets of  thousand as of december  this valuation allowance is due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain of these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of the recoverability of certain net operating losses 
in the event actual results diffe r from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
derivative instruments the company has held or issued certain derivative instruments and embedded derivative instruments and records these derivatives and embedded derivative instruments separate from the host contract in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
these standards require the company to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position and measure these instruments at fair value 
fair values are estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
fair value estimates are subject to significant change between periods due to fluctuations of the variables used in the model

liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred significant losses as it continues to fund mti micro s dmfc product development and commercialization programs 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  sales of securities available for sale  the operating results of mti instruments and mti micro  the availability of equity financing  including warrants issued in connection with the december capital raise  and the ability to attract government funding resources to offset research and development costs 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  thousand 
during the year ended december   the company s results of operations resulted in a net loss of  thousand and cash used in operating activities totaling  thousand 
this cash use in was funded primarily by cash and cash equivalents on hand as of december  of  thousand and proceeds from the sales of securities available for sale of  thousand 
during december  the company sold common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for net proceeds after expenses of approximately  thousand 
the company expects to continue to incur losses as it seeks to develop and commercialize mobion fuel cell systems and it expects to continue funding its operations from current cash and cash equivalents  the sales of securities available for sale  proceeds  if any  from equity financings  including warrants issued in connection with the december capital raise  and government funding 
subsequent to december   the company made changes to its mti micro operations  see recent developments in item business  new energy segment 
the company originally expected to spend approximately  thousand on research and development of mobion fuel cells and  thousand in research and development on mti instruments products during  however  subsequent to the suspension of the mti micro high power program  the company now expects to spend approximately  thousand on research and development of mobion fuel cells 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing during or that any additional financing will be available to the company on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the company s original plan expected to use cash totaling approximately  thousand to support operations and to use approximately thousand for capital expenditures 
subsequent to the decision to suspend mti micro s high power program  it now forecasts to use cash totaling approximately  thousand to support operations and approximately thousand for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures will consist of purchases for furniture  computer equipment  software and manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
based on the company s original plan  it believed it would have adequate resources to fund operations and capital expenditures through may of  relying on current cash and cash equivalents  current cash flow and revenue projections  and the potential sale of securities available for sale based on december  market values 
subsequent to the decision to suspend mti micro s high power program  the company now believes it will have adequate resources to fund operations and capital expenditures through september of  taking into consideration the impact of the suspension of the high power program as well as recent market decline in the value of the company s plug power stock holdings 
proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale are subject to fluctuations in the market value of plug power 
the company may also seek to supplement its resources through additional equity offerings  and additional government revenues could also provide more resources

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars and are translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since our investments are in cash equivalents 
based on the nature and current levels of our cash equivalents  however  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
as a result of holding marketable equity securities available for sale  the company is exposed to fluctuations in market value 
the company recognizes changes in market value through the balance sheet  however  if an other than temporary market decline were to occur  it could have a material impact on the company s operating results

these derivatives are valued quarterly using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company recognizes changes in fair value through the operating statement line titled gain loss on derivatives 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

the fair values of the company s holdings in securities available for sale have been based on quoted market prices and its derivative financial instruments based on estimates using valuation techniques
