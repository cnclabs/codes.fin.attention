item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see business risks and uncertainties regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative gene based therapies to treat cancer  vision and hearing loss and balance disorders  and vaccines to prevent infectious diseases 
we combine our patented gene transfer technologies with proprietary therapeutic genes to create product candidates  such as tnferade for cancer  currently in the phase iii portion of a pivotal trial for advanced pancreatic cancer  atoh for hearing and balance impairment and pedf for eye disease 
using the same  gene transfer technology  we are also collaborating with the us government and path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi for the development of vaccine candidates against infectious diseases  including hiv  malaria and influenza and a veterinary vaccine against foot and mouth disease 
we will seek collaborative partners to advance the clinical development of tnferade for the treatment of cancer  atoh for the treatment of hearing and balance impairment  pedf for the prevention of blindness  and biobypass for the treatment of heart disease 
if genvec enters into collaborative licensing and or funded research arrangements  operating expenses would increase commensurate with the increased revenues from such arrangements 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities and debt financings 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums and other general corporate expenditures 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  genvec evaluates its estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to genvec s financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
genvec believes the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
research and development r d revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus agreements are recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
non refundable r d fees for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
contract and upfront license payments where genvec has continued involvement through a research or development collaboration are recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with performance milestones are recognized based on achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  genvec has deferred recognition of up front contract or license payments received under its collaboration and license agreements and has recognized the related unearned revenues ratably over the terms of the collaboration agreements  generally ranging from two to four years 
clinical trial expenses and research and development activities the company accrues estimated costs for clinical and pre clinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
the company believes that this method best aligns the expenses it records with the efforts it expends 
the company monitors the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible  and adjusts the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known  all adjustments to date have been inconsequential 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute genvec s business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect its liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
genvec estimates that clinical trials of the type genvec generally conducts are typically completed over the following timelines estimated completion clinical phase date phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
genvec tests potential product candidates in pre clinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
genvec may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as genvec obtains results from trials  genvec may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus its resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards or fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revision is referred to as fas r share based payment or sfas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plans 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the twelve months ended december  consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans of approximately  in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more likely than not for recognition of tax benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides related guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
the provisions of fin will be effective for the company on january   with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle not otherwise reserved recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against all estimated net deferred tax assets at december  and we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial condition  results of operations and statement of cash flows 
see note in our notes to financial statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease in revenues is primarily a result of the successful completion of the one time production of clinical grade hiv vaccine supplies for planned administration to over  patients in a phase ii proof of concept trial pocet trial to be conducted by nih and expected to commence in the first half of to a lesser degree  revenues similarly declined due to the satisfactory completion of clinical material production  funded under our malaria vaccine contract with the us navy  for use in clinical testing that commenced in january  as well as lower reimbursable expenses incurred under our path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi vaccine development program 
these reductions were partially offset by an approximately million increase in revenue earned in under the previously announced million expansion of our usda funded program for the development of a foot and mouth disease vaccine 
revenues in also include approximately million in amortized revenues recognized under our development agreement with terumo corporation prior to the previously announced assignment of the agreement to mytogen  inc in december operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower pass through costs for the completed production in of clinical grade supplies of hiv and malaria vaccine candidates under our funded programs with nih and the us navy  respectively  as well as lower expenses incurred under our path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi vaccine development program 
these reductions were offset to a large extent by higher costs related to the continuing clinical evaluation of tnferade in our phase ii iii pivotal trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer  coupled with approximately  of stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the company s adoption of sfas no 
r on january  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to increased costs for performance based compensation  recruitment and relocation expenses and approximately  of stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the company s adoption of sfas no 
r 
loss on disposal of assets 
the loss on disposal of assets decreased to in from million in due to the non cash write off of intangible assets in conjunction with the previously announced sale of the company s myoblast cell therapy assets in december other income loss other income loss increased from  in other income in to  in other income in other interest income increased from  in to million in due primarily to an increase in interest rates earned on invested balances 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in due to a year to year   change in the non cash market value of our interest rate swap agreement and lower interest charges due to debt repayments of  during years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased percent to million in from million in primarily as a result of an increase of million in research activities under our funded vaccine programs with the national institute of health nih  us naval medical research center nmrc  us department of agriculture usda and the malaria vaccine initiative mvi 
revenue from our hiv vaccine development contract with nih increased million 
this increase is due to the initiation of the one time production of clinical grade hiv vaccine supplies for a phase ii proof of concept trial pocet trial to be conducted by nih and expected to commence in the first half of revenues in also include  in amortized revenues due to the accelerated recognition of deferred income resulting from the completion of all significant performance obligation under the terumo license and development agreement 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to expanded preparations to enable production of clinical grade hiv vaccine stocks for the expected phase ii pocet trial noted above  the pocet trial will be conducted as part of our funded collaborative vaccine development program with the vaccine research center at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases of the national institute of health under our subcontract managed by saic frederick  inc research and development efforts for our proprietary gene based therapeutic product candidates were focused on the continued clinical testing of tnferade  biobypass and pedf 
offsetting these costs were lower levels of research and development expenditures resulting from the closure of our myoblast cell therapy operation in the fourth quarter in conjunction with the sale of these assets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in the approximate  change is primarily a result of increases in a variety of expenditures including consulting  legal  facility and audit fees 
loss on disposal of assets 
the loss on disposal of assets primarily resulted from the million non cash write off of intangible assets in conjunction with the company s sale of its myoblast cell therapy assets in december other income loss other income loss increased from  in other income in to  in other income in other interest income increased from  in to  in this increase was due in part to higher interest rates as well as increased investment balances resulting from the million net proceeds realized from our september  equity financing 
interest expense increased from  in to  in due to a  non cash market value adjustment of our interest rate swap agreement partially offset by lower interest charges due to debt repayments of million during liquidity and capital resources to date  we have been engaged primarily in research and development activities 
as a result we have experienced and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future until one or more of our product candidates is commercialized 
as of december   we held million in cash and investments as compared to approximately million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million in compared with million used in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily reflecting net proceeds of million from issuance of stock and  from purchases under stock incentive programs offset by debt repayments of  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in  which consisted principally of the net proceeds of the sale and maturity of investment securities offset by the purchase of property and equipment totaling  as of december   our working capital was approximately million compared to million at december  historically  we have contracted with various academic institutions and research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
our external research  clinical study and financing commitments are summarized in the following table payments due by period s less than contractual obligations total year years years after years debt interest operating leases total contractual obligations we expect our revenue for the next several years to consist primarily of payments under government grants and contracts and  to a lesser extent  corporate collaborations and interest income 
we intend to focus our resources on our lead product candidate  tnferade  for the treatment of cancer 
with respect to our other product candidates  we will seek to form strategic alliances under which we will share the risks and costs of development 
we also will continue to look for funded research collaborations to help offset future anticipated losses from operations 
some of these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
we expect that significant additional financing will be required as we move our product candidates through clinical development  including the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase iii potion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
on march   we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd  under which kingsbridge has committed to purchase  at our option  up to a total of million of the company s common stock over a three year period 
due to the maximum number of shares that can be issued by the company under the ceff  the actual amount of additional financing available to us may be substantially less than the committed amount 
should we choose to utilize the ceff  net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ceff will help defray costs associated with expanded clinical testing of tnferade in locally advanced pancreatic cancer and or other indications and general corporate purposes 
as part of the ceff arrangement  the company issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price per share 
the company is obligated to sell a minimum of million of common stock available under the ceff within a two year period  if not  kingsbridge may terminate the agreement 
to date  the company has not drawn on the ceff but is eligible to do so when the variable weighted average price vwap of the company s stock equals or exceeds the minimum purchase price of per share 
on december  the company sold  shares of common stock to various investors at per share under our shelf registration 
proceeds from this sale  net of offering costs  totaled million 
on february   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration was declared effective february  and allows the company to obtain financing through the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants or debt 
to date  the company has not utilized the shelf registration but is eligible to do so at such time the company deems appropriate 
we believe that our existing cash reserves and anticipated cash flow from current collaborations will be sufficient to support our operations for approximately months 
without new collaborations  government grants or contracts  or additional equity financing  we would use approximately million in cash over the next twelve months  including approximately  for capital expenditures and million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above 
we expect that significant additional capital will be required which we may seek through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements or some combination of these financing alternatives 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors likely will experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
in addition  if we lack adequate funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development and or clinical programs 
as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million 
if not utilized  our loss carry forwards will expire at various dates through utilization of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the internal revenue code of we have not yet determined the extent to which limitations may have been triggered as a result of past or future financings 
this annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain net operating losses before their use 
off balance sheet obligations the company had no off sheet balance sheet obligations during fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to cash and cash equivalents  which consist of instruments having original maturities of three months or less  and our short term investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes and corporate bonds 
the securities in our short term investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their predominantly short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
as of december   securities totaling million are scheduled to mature in while we do not believe that an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct our pre clinical research activities 
clinical trials are currently conducted in the united states and  to a lesser extent  europe 
clinical sites in other locations outside of the united states are evaluated as needed 
all revenues to date have been received in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
at december   we had an outstanding industrial revenue bond payable of million 
this bond bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
during  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate over the life of the bond at percent plus a remarketing fee 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap  excluding accrued interest  was 
we also have outstanding loans totaling  at fixed interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
principal and interest on these loans is due and payable monthly
