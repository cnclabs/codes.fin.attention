strike impact on october   seven ufcw union locals struck the company s stores in southern california 
as a result  pursuant to the terms of a multi employer bargaining arrangement  kroger and albertson s locked out certain of their retail union employees in southern california food stores 
an agreement ending the strike was ratified by the union on february  employees returned to work beginning march  safeway estimates the overall cost of the strike and its residual effects reduced earnings by million before taxes per diluted share 
safeway estimated the impact of the strike by comparing internal forecasts immediately before the strike with actual results during and after the strike  at strike affected stores 
the estimate also includes the company s benefit under an agreement with kroger and albertson s that arises out of the multi employer bargaining process in southern california 
dominick s in the first quarter of  safeway closed under performing dominick s stores  which resulted in a store lease exit charge of million per diluted share 
dominick s incurred operating losses and declining sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
in february  the company announced a strategic plan to revitalize its operations at dominick s 
this plan includes remodeling stores to the lifestyle format  new store development and closing under performing stores in while management believes this strategy will improve sales and profitability  there can be no assurance that dominick s will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future 
randall s in the third quarter of  the company announced a plan to revitalize the texas market which included the closure of under performing stores  a focused lifestyle remodel program and the introduction of proprietary products 
this resulted in a pre tax  long lived asset impairment charge of million per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  safeway recorded million pre tax per diluted share in store exit activities for these stores 
other charges in the company incurred million before tax per diluted share in employee buyout charges  severance and related costs  relating primarily to dominick s and northern california

on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its view regarding certain lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in light of this letter  safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with gaap 
historically  the company recognized rent expense on a straight line basis beginning at the first rent payment 
the company now recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis when it takes possession and control of the property 
safeway recorded a million before tax charge per diluted share in to correct this error 
however  most of the adjustment was accumulated over many years

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability  as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point increase in the company s discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
some of the many sources of uncertainty in the company s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels  medical fee schedules  medical utilization guidelines  vocation rehabilitation and apportionment

and subsidiaries store closures safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
employee benefit plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
additional disclosures are also required 
safeway adopted sfas no 
as of december   as required 
the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note i to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended december   the average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for safeway s pension plans are as follows dollars in millions united states canada percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase expected return on assets pt discount rate pt cash contributions  primarily in canada  to the company s pension plans are expected to total approximately million in and totaled million in  million in and million in safeway expects to fund future contributions to the company s pension plans with cash flow from operations

table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries value on the date of grant 
the company determines fair value of such awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as a risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
goodwill safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
the factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows 
fair value is determined by an independent third party appraiser who primarily used the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method 
income tax contingencies the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years
