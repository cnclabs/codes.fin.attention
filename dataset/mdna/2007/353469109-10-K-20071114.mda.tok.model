results of operations overview of fiscal our fiscal operating results reflected year over year improvement compared to fiscal and continued the trend of improving operating results that began in prior years 
our consolidated sales increased million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in sales was due to improved training and consulting service sales  which offset declining product sales 
for the year ended august   we reported income from operations of million compared to million in fiscal  and our income before taxes increased to million compared to million in fiscal however  due primarily to the reversal of valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets in fiscal  which favorably impacted our reported income taxes by million refer to the discussion below and changes in our effective tax rate  our net income available to shareholders declined to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the changes in our effective income tax rate offset reduced preferred stock dividends resulting from the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal the following information is intended to provide an overview of the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  sales performance our consolidated sales increased million compared to the prior year on the strength of improved training and consulting service sales 
our training and consulting services sales increased by million compared to fiscal  which was attributable to improvements in both domestic and international delivery channels 
increased training and consulting service sales were partially offset by continuing declines in product sales 
our overall product sales declined by million  primarily due to performance in our retail stores and consumer direct channels 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to increased training and consulting services sales during fiscal  which also favorably affected our gross margin percentage compared to the prior year 
operating costs our operating costs increased by million compared to fiscal  not including the impact of the sale of a manufacturing facility 
the increase in operating costs was attributable to a million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  which was primarily due to increased commissions and related compensation expense from improved training and consulting service sales 
increased sg a costs were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million decline in amortization expense 
during fiscal  we sold a manufacturing facility that was previously used for printing operations and recognized a million gain from the sale  which improved our income from operations compared to the prior year 
income taxes our income tax provision for fiscal totaled million compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal the comparability of our current year income tax expense was primarily affected by the determination during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
prior to the reversal of these valuation allowances  our income tax provisions were affected by reductions in our deferred income tax valuation allowance as we utilized net operating loss carryforwards 
the fiscal income tax provision was further reduced by the reversal of tax contingency reserves during the third quarter of that year 
no material corresponding reversals of valuation allowance or tax contingency reserves occurred during fiscal our effective tax rate for the year ended august  of approximately percent was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program and withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign licensees 
since the company is currently utilizing net operating loss carryforwards  we are unable to reduce our domestic tax liability through the use of foreign tax credits  which normally result from the payment of foreign withholding taxes 
preferred stock redemption during the third quarter of fiscal  we used substantially all of our cash on hand  combined with proceeds from a newly obtained million line of credit  to redeem all of our remaining preferred stock 
the final redemption of preferred stock totaled million and as a result of this redemption we will have no further preferred stock dividend obligation 
we believe that the redemption of our preferred stock and elimination of the corresponding dividend obligation will improve our reported net income and cash flows in future periods 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income before income taxes in our consolidated income statements year ended august  product sales training and consulting services sales total sales product cost of sales training and consulting services cost of sales total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative gain on sale of manufacturing facility depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense recovery from legal settlement gain on disposal of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary income before income taxes segment review we have two reporting segments the consumer solutions business unit csbu and the organizational solutions business unit osbu 
the following is a brief description of these segments and their primary operating activities 
consumer solutions business unit this business unit is primarily focused on sales of products to individual customers and small business organizations and includes the results of our domestic retail stores  consumer direct operations primarily ecommerce  call center  and public programs  wholesale operations  international product channels in certain countries  and other related distribution channels  including government product sales and domestic printing and publishing sales 
the csbu results of operations also include the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  software  totes  and related accessories  virtually any component of our leadership  productivity  and strategy execution solutions may be purchased through our csbu channels 
organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of strategic execution  productivity  leadership  sales force performance  and communication training and consulting solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of our domestic sales force and certain international operations 
the domestic sales force is responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting services in the united states 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our wholly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
the following table sets forth sales data by category and for our operating segments for the periods indicated 
for further information regarding our reporting segments and geographic information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k in thousands 
year ended august  percent change from prior year percent change from prior year sales by category products training and consulting services consumer solutions business unit retail stores consumer direct wholesale csbu international other csbu organizational solutions business unit domestic international total net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales overall product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  totes  software and related accessories that are generally sold through our csbu channels  declined million  or six percent  compared to fiscal the decline in overall product sales was primarily due to continuing decreases in retail store sales and declining sales through our consumer direct channels when compared to prior periods 
the following is a description of sales performance in our various csbu channels for the year ended august  retail sales the million decline in retail sales was primarily due to the impact of closed stores  reduced sales of technology and specialty products  and decreased store traffic 
based upon various analyses  we closed certain retail store locations in late fiscal and during fiscal  which had a million unfavorable impact on our overall retail sales in fiscal due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products  we decided to exit the low margin handheld device and accessories business  which reduced retail sales by million compared to the prior year 
for the remaining retail stores  the decline in sales was primarily due to reduced traffic  or consumers entering our retail locations 
our retail store traffic declined by approximately percent from fiscal and resulted in decreased sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories compared to the prior year 
these factors combined to produce a six percent decline in year over year comparable store stores which were open during the comparable periods sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal at august   we were operating domestic retail locations compared to locations at august  consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels decreased million  primarily due to a decline in the conversion rate of customers visiting our website  decreased consumer traffic through the call center channel  and decreased public seminar sales 
although visits to our website increased from the prior year  the conversion of those visits to sales decreased to percent in fiscal compared from percent in fiscal we believe that the increase in customer visits and decrease in conversion rate is primarily a function of the increase in promotionally oriented shoppers  or those who visit the website frequently  but only purchase when desired products are on sale 
declining consumer traffic through the call center channel continues a long term trend and decreased by approximately four percent  which we believe is primarily a result of the transition of customers to our website 
public seminar sales decreased million due to fewer scheduled events and decreased participation in those seminars 
wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  were up approximately one percent over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of retail outlets serviced through our wholesale channel and increased demand for our products in those locations 
csbu international this channel includes the product sales of our directly owned international offices in canada  the united kingdom  mexico  and australia 
sales performance through these channels decreased slightly compared with the prior year 
we separated the product sales operations from the osbu in these international locations during fiscal to utilize existing product sales and marketing expertise in an effort to improve overall product sales performance at these offices 
other csbu sales other csbu sales primarily consist of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the increase in other csbu sales was primarily due to improved external domestic printing sales  which increased million compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to additional printing contracts obtained during fiscal in fiscal  we reported million of sublease revenues as a component of product sales in our consolidated financial statements compared to million in the prior year 
training and consulting services we offer a variety of training courses  training related products  and consulting services focused on leadership  productivity  strategy execution  sales force performance  and effective communications that are provided both domestically and internationally through the osbu 
our consolidated training and consulting service sales increased million compared to the prior year and maintained the favorable momentum in training and consulting sales that began in fiscal training and consulting service sales performance during fiscal was primarily influenced by the following factors in our osbu divisions domestic our domestic training  consulting  and related sales reported through the osbu continued to show improvement over the prior year and increased by million  or percent 
the improvement was primarily due to the december launch of our new course  leadership great leaders  great teams  great results and increased sales in our individual effectiveness product lines  which contain our signature course based upon principles found in the seven habits of highly effective people 
our execution product lines  which are primarily based on our disciplines of execution curriculum and our helping clients succeed sales training program also showed year over year improvements and contributed to improved training and consulting service sales 
generally  our training programs and consulting services continue to gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace and all five of our geographic regions generated increased year over year sales 
furthermore  the number of training and coaching days delivered increased percent and the average revenue per day received increased six percent 
sales of training materials to our client facilitators also improved over the prior year 
our current outlook for fiscal remains strong 
we believe that the introduction of new programs and refreshed existing programs will continue to have a favorable impact on training and consulting service sales in future periods 
for instance  we have developed an interactive training tool based on the seven habits of highly effective people  which will be released to the general public during fiscal international international sales increased million compared to fiscal sales from our wholly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from third party licensees all grew compared to fiscal the translation of foreign sales to the united states dollar also helped to improve reported sales and had a million favorable impact on our consolidated sales as certain foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during the year ended august  our wholly owned subsidiary in japan generated the largest year over year improvement  and grew its revenues percent  including the effects of foreign exchange  compared to the prior year 
on august   we finalized the sales and conversions of our wholly owned subsidiary in brazil and the training and consulting operations of our mexico office into licensees 
we sold these operations to external licensee operations and we will receive royalties from their operations based upon gross sales 
although we anticipate a decline in future international sales resulting from the conversion of these offices to licensees  we expect operating income from these countries to increase in future periods 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold or the cost of services provided 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
we record the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of our consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross profit may not be comparable with the gross profit of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
our consolidated gross profit totaled million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in our gross profit was primarily attributable to increased training and consulting service sales through our osbu 
our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to the continuing shift toward increased training and consulting sales  which generally have higher margins than the majority of our product sales 
training and consulting service sales increased to percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
our gross margin on product sales declined slightly to percent compared to percent in fiscal during fiscal  our training and consulting services gross margin was percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the improvement in training and consulting services gross margin was primarily due to changes in the mix of training programs sold as certain programs and training courses have higher gross margins than other programs 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our consolidated selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses consisted primarily of increased associate expenses  increased development costs  increased legal fees  and increased accounting fees 
our associate expenses increased million primarily due to increased commissions and bonuses on improved osbu sales and additional osbu sales personnel  which totaled million  and increased share based compensation costs totaling million  which was primarily attributable to performance awards granted in fiscal we spent an additional million for non capitalized curriculum development to make adjustments and minor improvements to certain programs and courses during fiscal our legal fees increased primarily due to the effects of a non recurring benefit recorded in fiscal from the wma legal settlement and increased legal costs for ongoing litigation that had a net impact on our operating expenses totaling million 
during fiscal  we were required to begin complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  which resulted in million of additional auditing and related consulting fees in fiscal compared with the prior year 
these increases in sg a expense were partially offset by reduced costs in various other areas of the company 
gain on sale of manufacturing facility in august  we initiated a project to reconfigure our printing operations to improve our printing services efficiency  reduce operating costs  and improve our printing services flexibility to potentially increase external printing service sales 
our reconfiguration plan included moving our printing operations a short distance from its existing location to our corporate headquarters campus and the sale of the manufacturing facility and certain printing presses 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility 
the sale price was million and  after deducting customary closing costs  the net proceeds to the company from the sale totaled million in cash 
the carrying value of the manufacturing facility at the date of sale was approximately million and we recognized a million gain on the sale of the manufacturing facility during the year ended august  depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
during recent fiscal years our depreciation expense has declined due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment including retail stores and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures 
however  these declines stabilized during fiscal primarily due to increased capital expenditures for property and equipment and an impairment charge totaling million that we recorded during fiscal to reduce the carrying value of one of our printing presses that was sold to its anticipated sale price 
amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets totaled million compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully depreciated during the first two quarters of fiscal we anticipate that intangible asset amortization expense will total million in fiscal interest income and expense interest income our interest income decreased by million primarily due to reduced cash and cash equivalents held during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we used substantially all of our available cash on hand combined with proceeds from a newly acquired line of credit to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
interest expense interest expense increased million compared to the prior year primarily due to line of credit borrowings that were used in conjunction with available cash to redeem the remaining shares of preferred stock in the third quarter of fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate has been unusual in recent years due to the effect of operating losses and changes in valuation allowances 
absent extraordinary  unforeseen events  we expect our effective income tax rate in future years to be approximately percent  primarily due to the effect of permanent book versus tax differences and income from foreign licensees 
however  the utilization of domestic loss carryforwards will minimize cash outflows related to domestic income taxes until they are exhausted 
refer to the discussion in the overview of fiscal for information regarding our income tax provision and its impact upon our fiscal operations compared to the prior year 
preferred stock dividends our preferred stock dividends totaled million for fiscal compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to fiscal preferred stock redemptions totaling million and the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal we have no further preferred stock dividend obligations following the redemption of the remaining preferred stock 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales our consolidated product sales declined million compared to fiscal the decline in product sales was primarily due to decreased retail store sales resulting from store closures that occurred during fiscal and the following is a description of sales performance in our csbu delivery channels during the year ended august  retail sales the decline in retail sales was primarily due to store closures  which had a million unfavorable impact on our retail store sales in fiscal our retail stores also sold million less technology and specialty products when compared to the prior year  primarily due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products 
although store closures and reduced technology and specialty product sales caused total retail sales to decline compared to the prior year  we recognized a percent improvement in year over year comparable store stores which were open during the comparable periods sales in fiscal as sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories increased compared to the prior year 
at august   we were operating domestic retail locations compared to locations at august  consumer direct sales through our consumer direct segment increased primarily due to increased public seminar sales and increased sales of core products 
increased public seminar sales resulted from additional seminars held during fiscal and an increase in the number of participants attending these programs 
wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  were essentially flat compared to the prior year 
csbu international this channel includes the product sales of our directly owned international offices in canada  the united kingdom  mexico  and australia 
sales increased in these countries primarily due to increased demand for products during the fiscal year 
other csbu sales the increase in other csbu sales was primarily attributable to increased sublease income from additional sublease contracts obtained during fiscal we have subleased a substantial portion of our corporate headquarters in salt lake city  utah and have recognized million of sublease revenue during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal training and consulting services sales our consolidated training and consulting service sales totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal the improvement in training sales was reflected in both domestic and international training program and consulting sales 
the following is a description of our sales performance in the osbu channels domestic our domestic sales performance improved in nearly all sales regions and was primarily attributable to increased sales of the refreshed the habits of highly effective people training course and the expansion of our sales force 
domestic sales also increased million as a result of additional symposium conferences that were held during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal these sales increases were partially offset by reduced sales force performance training  due to decreased demand in fiscal  and decreased sales from seminars presented by dr 
stephen r 
covey 
in fiscal  dr 
covey presented more seminars to coincide with the publication of his new book  the th habit 
international total international sales improved by million  primarily due to increased sales at our wholly owned operations in japan  canada  and brazil  as well as increased licensee royalty revenues 
international sales improvements from these sources were partially offset by decreased sales in the united kingdom and mexico  unfavorable currency translation rates  and the correction of misstatements at our mexico subsidiary 
during fiscal  certain foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  weakened against the united states dollar  which had an unfavorable impact on reported sales 
the unfavorable impact of currency translation on reported international sales totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that our mexico subsidiary misstated its financial results in prior periods by recording improper sales transactions and not recording all operating expenses in proper periods 
we determined that the misstatements occurred during fiscal through fiscal in various amounts 
the correction of these misstatements  which primarily occurred in prior fiscal years  resulted in a million decrease in international sales in fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased product sales 
however  our consolidated gross margin improved to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily attributable to improved margins on product sales  which was partially offset by declining margins on our training and consulting sales 
our gross margin on product sales improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in product sales gross margin was primarily due to improved inventory management processes  which reduced obsolescence  scrap  and other related charges  and changes in our product mix as sales of lower margin technology and specialty products continued to decline while sales of higher margin core products increased compared to the prior year 
our overall gross margin on training and consulting services declined to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease in training and consulting services gross margin was primarily attributable to increased sales of lower margin symposium conferences and decreased sales of higher margin sales performance training products during fiscal these unfavorable gross margin items were partially offset by decreased sales of lower margin seminars presented by dr 
covey in the fiscal year 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our consolidated sg a expenses decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to reduced retail store costs resulting from operating fewer stores  reductions in executive severance costs  reduced stock based compensation costs  and the favorable results of initiatives to reduce overall operating costs 
our retail store sg a expenses decreased million primarily due to store closures that occurred during fiscal and in prior periods refer to discussion below 
during fiscal we incurred and expensed million of severance costs to our former general counsel and we did not incur any similar executive severance charges in fiscal our stock based compensation costs declined million due to a fully vested stock award granted to the ceo and accelerated vesting on unvested stock awards during fiscal the overall decrease in stock based compensation cost was partially offset by expenses from our long term incentive plan see discussion below during fiscal in addition to these decreases  we continue to implement strategies designed to reduce our overall operating costs 
the favorable impact of these efforts has resulted in reduced sg a expenses in many areas of the company during the fiscal year ended august  these cost reductions were partially offset by additional spending on growth initiatives that resulted in increased travel expenses resulting from further employee training and sales leadership events  which totaled million  and increased osbu associate costs totaling million resulting primarily from hiring additional sales personnel 
we also corrected misstated operating expenses at our mexico subsidiary  which had a million unfavorable impact on our sg a expenses in fiscal we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  including previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we closed stores during fiscal the costs associated with closing retail stores are typically comprised of charges related to vacating the premises  which may include a provision for the remaining term on the lease  and severance and other personnel costs 
these store closure costs totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  when we closed retail locations 
store closure costs are expensed as incurred and were included as a component of our sg a expense 
during fiscal our shareholders approved a long term incentive plan ltip that permits the grant of annual unvested share awards of common stock to certain employees 
these ltip share awards granted during fiscal cliff vest on august   which is the completion of a three year performance period 
the number of shares that are finally awarded to participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of a combination of performance objectives related to sales growth and operating income during the three year performance period 
the award was initially for  shares target award of common stock 
the award shares were valued at per share  and the corresponding initial compensation cost totaled million 
however  the number of shares that will ultimately vest under the ltip will vary depending on whether the performance criteria are met or exceeded 
the award will be reviewed quarterly and the value may be adjusted  depending on the performance of the company compared to the award criteria 
based upon fiscal financial performance and estimated performance through the remaining service period  the number of performance awards granted during fiscal was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal to  shares  which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to our fiscal operating results of million 
the compensation cost of the award is being expensed over the three year service period of the award and increased our stock based compensation cost in fiscal by million 
the continued amortization of the fiscal award and any future ltip grants may increase our sg a expense during the vesting period 
on september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
although the additional compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r was immaterial to our fiscal year ended august   our operating expenses may be unfavorably affected in future periods if we grant additional stock options or participation in our employee stock purchase program increases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decline was due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets during fiscal and in prior periods 
during fiscal  we reduced the remaining estimated useful life of customer lists acquired in the merger with the covey leadership center based upon expected future sales from these customers 
this change in accounting estimate increased our amortization expense in fiscal by million 
other income and expense items interest income our interest income increased million primarily due to increased interest rates on our interest bearing cash accounts 
interest expense our interest expense increased million primarily due to the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and the resulting interest component of the financing obligation in our lease payments to the landlord 
legal settlement in fiscal  we filed legal action against world marketing alliance  inc  a georgia corporation wma  and world financial group  inc  a delaware corporation and purchaser of substantially all assets of wma  for breach of contract 
the case proceeded to trial and the jury rendered a verdict in our favor and against wma for the entire unpaid contract amount of approximately million 
in addition to the verdict  we recovered legal fees totaling million and pre and post judgment interest of million from wma 
we received payment in cash from wma for the total verdict amount  including legal fees and interest 
however  shortly after paying the verdict amount  wma appealed the jury decision to the th circuit court of appeals and we recorded receipt of the verdict amount plus legal fees and interest with a corresponding increase to accrued liabilities and deferred the gain until the case was finally resolved 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with wma 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  wma agreed to dismiss its appeal 
as a result of this settlement agreement and dismissal of wma s appeal  we recorded a million gain from the legal settlement 
income taxes the increase in our income tax benefit in fiscal was due to the reversal of the majority of our valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets  which totaled million 
the fiscal income tax benefit was partially offset by taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees and taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions by our profitable directly owned foreign operations 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and was partially offset by taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees and taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions resulting from profitable foreign operations 
quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the years ended august  and the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
quarterly financial information year ended august  december march june august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense gain on sale of manufacturing facility depreciation amortization income from operations income before income taxes net income preferred stock dividends income available to common shareholders earnings loss per share available to common shareholders basic diluted year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income preferred stock dividends income available to common shareholders earnings per share available to common shareholders basic diluted our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
domestic training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
due to our modified week fiscal calendar  our quarter ended december  had five additional business days than the quarter ended november  our quarter ended august  had a corresponding five fewer business days than the quarter ended august during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed valuation allowances on certain deferred income tax assets which had a million favorable impact on our net income and net income available to common shareholders for that period 
during the quarter ended may   we determined that our mexico subsidiary had misstated its financial results in prior periods by recording improper sales transactions and not recording all operating expenses in proper periods 
we determined that the misstatements occurred during fiscal through fiscal in various amounts 
the audit committee engaged an independent legal firm to investigate the misstatements and they concluded that such misstatements were intentional 
the company determined that the impact of these misstatements was immaterial to previously issued financial statements and we recorded a million decrease to international sales and a million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses during the quarter ended may  to correct these misstatements 
we have taken actions as recommended by the investigators to prevent future misstatements  which included enhancements to internal control over foreign operations 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the timing of large corporate orders  the elimination of unprofitable products or training services  and the closure of retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources summary at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased to million at august  compared to million at august  the decline in cash and working capital was due to the redemption of all remaining shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal we used substantially all of our cash on hand combined with proceeds from a newly obtained line of credit to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of series a preferred stock at its liquidation preference of per share plus accrued dividends 
the final preferred stock redemption totaled million and we obtained a million line of credit to facilitate the transaction 
although we will incur additional interest expense on line of credit borrowings  we believe that the redemption of our remaining preferred stock and elimination of the corresponding percent dividend obligation will improve our cash flows and reported results of operations in future periods 
our debt structure consists of a million line of credit that may be used for working capital and other general needs  a long term variable rate mortgage on our canadian building  and a long term lease on our corporate campus that is accounted for as a financing obligation 
the million line of credit carries an interest rate equal to libor plus percent weighted average rate of percent at august  expires on march  we may draw on the line of credit facility  repay  and draw again  on a revolving basis  up to the maximum loan amount of million so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the working capital line of credit also contains customary representations and guarantees as well as provisions for repayment and liens 
in addition to customary non financial terms and conditions  our line of credit requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including i a funded debt to earnings ratio  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a limitation on annual capital expenditures  and iv a defined amount of minimum net worth 
in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lenders are entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of amounts outstanding on the line of credit 
during fiscal  we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants of our credit facilities 
at august   we had million outstanding on the line of credit  which was classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet primarily due to our intention to repay the outstanding amount during fiscal the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  cash flows from operating activities our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our cash flows from operating activities were favorably affected by increased sales and improved operating income compared to fiscal however  the additional cash provided by improved operations was offset by changes in working capital as cash was used to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities by million  used for purchases of additional inventory items totaling million  and used to finance the impact of million of increased accounts receivable that were primarily the result of increased osbu training and consulting sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures our primary uses of cash for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment totaling million and expenditures for curriculum development totaling million 
purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of payments for new printing presses and related printing equipment resulting from the reconfiguration of our printing services  leasehold improvements in relocated stores and at the corporate campus for sublease tenants  new computer hardware  and additional computer software 
during fiscal  we used cash for further investment in curriculum development  primarily related to new online learning modules and the development of new interactive leadership curriculum based upon principles found in the habits of highly effective people 
partially offsetting these uses of cash for investing activities was the receipt of million from sales of property and equipment 
the proceeds from sales of property and equipment were generated primarily from the sale of our printing manufacturing facility and certain printing equipment in connection with the reconfiguration of our printing services 
during fiscal  we expect to spend million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
purchases of property and equipment are expected to consist of additional computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements in new stores  and in other areas as necessary 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities our primary uses of cash for financing activities included the redemption of our remaining outstanding shares of series a preferred stock for million  purchases totaling  shares of our common stock for treasury through our board of director authorized plan for million  payment of preferred stock dividends totaling million  and principal payments totaling million on our long term debt and financing obligation 
these uses of cash for financing activities were partially offset by proceeds obtained through our line of credit facility obtained during fiscal our net proceeds from the new line of credit totaled million for the year ended august  sources of liquidity going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by the sale of goods and services to our clients on the condition that we can continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from our line of credit  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  purchases of our common stock  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  minimum rent payments for retail store and sales office space  mortgage payments on certain buildings and property  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services required lease payments on corporate campus minimum operating lease payments line of credit long term mortgage payments contractual computer hardware purchases purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments interest expense on the line of credit payments was calculated at percent  which was the weighted average interest rate on august  the obligation disclosure assumes that the august  line of credit balance and corresponding interest will be repaid evenly through the fiscal year ended august  our long term variable rate mortgage obligation includes interest payments at  which was the applicable interest rate at august  we are contractually obligated by our eds outsourcing agreement to purchase the necessary computer hardware to keep such equipment up to current specifications 
amounts shown are estimated capital purchases of computer hardware  which may change based upon systems related projects  under terms of the eds outsourcing agreement and its amendments 
other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources products we sell planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that are primarily sold through our csbu channels 
training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
these training programs and services are primarily sold through our osbu channels 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sale transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sales arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the sales contract meet the following criteria the delivered training or product has value to the client on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
if the fair value of all undelivered elements exits  but fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total contract consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for the company s existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of the company s software sales have elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently the company does not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of its software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the support period 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate the company s content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell the company s training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of the licensee s sales 
the company recognizes royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to the company from the licensee 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation during fiscal  we granted performance based compensation awards to certain employees in a board of director approved long term incentive plan the ltip 
these performance based share awards allow each participant the right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based upon the achievement of specified financial goals at the end of a predetermined performance period 
the ltip awards vest on august of the third fiscal year from the grant date  which corresponds to the completion of a three year performance cycle 
for example  the ltip awards granted in fiscal vest on august  the number of shares that are finally awarded to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of a combination of performance objectives related to sales growth and cumulative operating income during the performance period 
due to the variable number of shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate the ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded for each grant based upon financial results of the company as compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are based upon estimated future performance and are made on a cumulative basis at the date of adjustment based upon the probable number of shares to be awarded 
the compensation committee initially granted awards for  shares the target award of common stock under the ltip during fiscal however  the actual number of shares finally awarded will range from zero shares  if a minimum level of performance is not achieved  to percent of the target award  if specifically defined performance criteria is achieved during the three year performance period 
the minimum sales growth necessary for participants to receive any shares under the fiscal ltip is percent and the minimum cumulative operating income is million 
the number of shares finally awarded to ltip participants under the fiscal ltip grant is based upon the combination of factors as shown below sales growth percent of target shares awarded cumulative operating income millions based upon actual financial performance through august   the sale of our brazil and mexico subsidiaries  and estimated performance through the remaining service period of the fiscal ltip grant fiscal and  the number of performance awards granted during fiscal was decreased to  shares  which resulted in cumulative adjustments to decrease our operating expenses totaling million during fiscal at august   there was a total of million of unrecognized compensation cost related to our fiscal ltip grant 
the total compensation cost of the fiscal ltip will be equal to the number of shares finally issued multiplied by per share  which was the fair value of the common shares determined at the grant date 
during fiscal  the compensation committee granted performance awards for  shares of common stock under the terms of the ltip 
consistent with the fiscal ltip grant  the company must achieve minimum levels of sales growth and cumulative operating income in order for participants to receive any shares under the ltip grant 
the minimum sales growth for the fiscal ltip is percent fiscal compared to fiscal and the minimum cumulative operating income total is million 
we will record compensation expense using a percent estimated forfeiture rate during the vesting period 
however  the total amount of compensation expense recorded for the fiscal ltip will equal the number of shares awarded multiplied by per share 
based primarily upon the sale of our brazil and mexico subsidiaries  and actual operating performance in fiscal  the number of performance awards granted in connection with the fiscal grant was decreased to  shares  which resulted in cumulative adjustments to decrease our operating expenses by million during the year ended august  at august  there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the fiscal ltip grant 
the number of shares finally awarded to ltip participants under the fiscal ltip grant is based upon the combination of factors as shown below sales growth percent of target shares awarded cumulative operating income millions the analysis of our ltip plans contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and corresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we record cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants 
actual results could differ  and differ materially  from estimates made during the service  or vesting  period 
we estimate the value of our stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
however  the company did not grant any stock options during the years ended august    or and the remaining cost associated with our unvested stock options at august  was insignificant 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances past due over days  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation contains uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectibility of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectibility assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions are then based upon the comparison  which may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would reduce our reported income from operations by approximately million 
inventory valuation our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  stationery  training products  and other accessories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory loss reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory loss reserve calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory reserve calculations during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have a materially adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for instance  a percent increase in our inventory loss reserves at august  would reduce our income from operations by approximately million 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the osbu and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars  international licensee royalties  and related products 
if the carrying value of the covey trade name exceeds the fair value of its discounted estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the discounted future cash flows 
the adjusted basis becomes the carrying value until a future impairment assessment determines that additional impairment charges are necessary 
our impairment evaluation calculation for the covey trade name contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  to estimate an appropriate royalty rate  and to select a discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows 
our valuation methodology for the covey trade name was developed by an independent valuation firm and has remained materially unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name  our trade name related revenues and licensee royalties would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair the covey trade name 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes it new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
although we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology during the past three years  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
the tax benefits of tax exposure items are not recognized in the provision for income taxes unless it is probable that the benefits will be sustained  without regard to the likelihood of tax examination 
a tax exposure reserve represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the tax exposure reserve is classified as a component of the current income taxes payable account 
the company adds interest and penalties  if applicable  each period to the reserve 
taxes and penalties are a component of the overall income tax provision 
interest on income tax items is recorded as a component of consolidated interest expense 
however  upon adoption of fin no 
in fiscal  interest on income taxes will included as a component of overall income tax expense 
the company recognizes the benefits of the tax exposure items in the financial statements  that is  the reserve is reversed  when it becomes probable that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  the company considers all available positive evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence will not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for internal revenue service audits  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our tax exposure reserve contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets  considering recent profitability  known trends and events  and expected future transactions 
for several years prior to the year ended august   our history of significant operating losses precluded us from demonstrating that it was more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards would be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
in fiscal we reversed the majority of these valuation allowances 
due to improved operating performance  business models  and expectations regarding future taxable income  the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits of domestic operating loss carryforwards  together with the benefits of other deferred income tax assets will be realized 
thus  we reversed the valuation allowances on certain of our domestic deferred income tax assets  except for million related to foreign tax credits 
however  events and circumstances may change in future periods  requiring us to record valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
these deferred tax valuation allowances could have a material impact upon our reported financial position and results of operations 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement standard  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing  and measuring tax positions for financial statement purposes 
this interpretation also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainties as they relate to income tax accounting and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the provisions of fin no 
on september  fiscal and the cumulative effect from the adoption of fin no 
 if any  will be an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measures in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures 
this statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement no 
only applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
this statement is effective for the specified fair value measures for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and will thus be effective for the company in fiscal we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact of sfas no 
on our financial statements 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of planners and related products  including paper and leather materials 
we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain written and oral statements made by the company or our representatives in this report  other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  conferences  internet web casts  or otherwise  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or achievements  and may contain words such as believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  or words or phrases of similar meaning

these  and other forward looking statements  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in reports filed by us with the sec  including reports on forms k  q  and k 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed in item a of this report on form k for the fiscal year ended august   entitled risk factors 
in addition  such risks and uncertainties may include unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas unanticipated costs or capital expenditures  difficulties encountered by eds in operating and maintaining our information systems and controls  including without limitation  the systems related to demand and supply planning  inventory control  and order fulfillment  delays or unanticipated outcomes relating to our strategic plans  dependence on existing products or services  the rate and consumer acceptance of new product introductions  competition  the number and nature of customers and their product orders  including changes in the timing or mix of product or training orders  pricing of our products and services and those of competitors  adverse publicity  and other factors which may adversely affect our business 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance  including the risk factors noted in item a of this report on form k 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors may emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any single factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the price of our common stock can change for reasons unrelated to our performance 
due to our low market capitalization  the price of our common stock may also be affected by conditions such as a lack of analyst coverage and fewer potential investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expire on a quarterly basis  are recognized currently and are used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated income statements and had the following net impact on the periods indicated in thousands year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net gain loss on foreign exchange contracts at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 
the notional amounts of our foreign currency sell contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars mexican pesos japanese yen australian dollars net investment hedges during fiscal we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that were designed to manage foreign currency risks related to the value of our net investment in wholly owned operations located in canada  japan  and the united kingdom 
these three offices comprise the majority of our net investment in foreign operations 
these foreign currency forward instruments qualified for hedge accounting and corresponding gains and losses were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal we recognized the following net losses on our net investment hedging contracts in thousands year ended august  losses on net investment hedge contracts gains on net investment hedge contracts net losses on investment hedge contracts as of august   we had settled our net investment hedge contracts and we did not utilize any net investment hedge contracts in fiscal or fiscal however  we may utilize net investment hedge contracts in future periods as a component of our overall foreign currency risk strategy 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily due to our line of credit borrowings and long term mortgage obligation in canada 
at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility  a variable rate line of credit arrangement  and a variable rate long term mortgage on certain of our buildings and property in canada 
the addition of the variable rate line of credit increased our interest rate sensitivity and in the future our overall interest rate sensitivity will be influenced by the amounts borrowed on the line of credit and the prevailing interest rates  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent 
the line of credit had a weighted average interest rate of percent at august  and our variable rate mortgage has interest charged at the canadian prime rate percent at august  and requires payments through january at august  borrowing levels  a one percent increase to the interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase our interest expense over the next year by approximately million 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
