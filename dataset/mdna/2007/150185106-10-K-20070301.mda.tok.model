item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
on june   we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of capital stock of paramount parks  inc ppi from a subsidiary of cbs corporation 
upon closing of the transaction  we acquired  indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiary magnum management corporation the following amusement parks canada s wonderland near toronto  canada  kings island near cincinnati  ohio  kings dominion near richmond  virginia  carowinds near charlotte  north carolina  and great america located in santa clara  california 
we also acquired star trek the experience  an interactive adventure in las vegas  and a management contract for gilroy gardens family theme park in gilroy  
table of contents california 
the acquisition represents a major strategic event in cedar fair s history and is expected to result in cost synergies as well as future growth opportunities 
the results of ppi operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from june   the date of acquisition 
further discussion of the ppi transaction can be found under note to the consolidated financial statements

in order to efficiently manage our properties and communicate our results  we have created regional designations for our parks 
the northern region  which is the largest  includes cedar point and the adjacent soak city water park  kings island  canada s wonderland  dorney park  valleyfair  geauga lake and michigan s adventure 
the southern region includes kings dominion  carowinds  worlds of fun and oceans of fun 
finally  our western region includes knott s berry farm  great america and the soak city water parks located in palm springs  san diego and adjacent to knott s berry farm

for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income the most comparable financial measure  see note in item  selected financial data  on page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and 
table of contents complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates and assumptions  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 
accounting for business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by management  taking into consideration information obtained during the due diligence process  valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts and other relevant information 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these estimates are established based upon historical claims data and third party estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in these factors and adjustments are made as needed 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we only have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
the use of derivative financial instruments is accounted for according to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related amendments 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 

table of contents results of operations vs 
our results for are not directly comparable to the prior year due to the acquisition of ppi on june  since material changes to our statements of operations are primarily due to this acquisition  we will also discuss operating results for on a same park basis compared to the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and all properties a same park comparison b increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses depreciation and amortization non cash compensation expense operating income a includes results for all owned and or managed properties as of december  b same park comparison includes properties owned and operated for the full year in and and excludes the acquired parks 
same park comparison consolidated net revenues in on a same park basis decreased slightly to million from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of a decrease in combined attendance  a increase in out of park revenues and average guest per capita spending which increased slightly 
the small decrease in attendance and revenues is primarily due to performance at some of our northern region parks 
this region was impacted by a continued soft economy coupled with higher gas prices throughout the operating season 
this decrease was partially offset by increased attendance and per capita spending at other parks within the region 
the southern region  which benefited from a world class roller coaster introduced at worlds of fun  increased attendance and revenues over  while the western region parks increased their in park and out of park revenues on relatively steady attendance 
excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  total cash operating costs and expenses  on a same park basis  increased slightly to million from million in the increase was attributable to higher operating costs in our southern region due in part to higher attendance  somewhat offset by reduced operating costs at geauga lake 
after higher depreciation  offset by lower non cash charge for unit options  operating income for on a same park basis decreased to million from million a year ago 

table of contents because we strongly emphasize generating cash flow for distributions to our unitholders  a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
in  adjusted ebitda on a same park basis decreased  or million  to million  in large part due to a decrease in operating profits from some of our northern region parks 
this decrease was offset slightly by improved results at other parks within the northern region  our southern region parks  where a new world class roller coaster was introduced at worlds of fun  and our western parks  where in park and out of park spending increased year over year 
based on these results  our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in on a same park basis decreased to from in all properties on a combined basis including the newly acquired parks  consolidated net revenues for were million 
excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  combined operating costs and expenses were million 
after depreciation and a small non cash charge for unit options  operating income for  was million compared with million in interest expense for the year increased million to million  due to the acquisition financing and refinancing of existing debt 
as part of the refinancing of existing debt  we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million 
further discussion of this transaction can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries million and publicly traded partnership ptp taxes million 
this compares with a benefit for taxes of for  when we reversed million of contingent liabilities related to ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  combined net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
vs 
consolidated net revenues in increased  or million  to million 
the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in combined attendance across our properties to million from million in  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  and a  or million  increase in out of park revenues 
although combined attendance increased only  or approximately  visits  in park revenues increased approximately million on the strength of improved average in park guest per capita spending 
the increase in out of park revenues was due to the first full year performance of the castaway bay indoor waterpark resort  as well as improved results at our knott s berry farm resort hotel and the introduction of a new tgi friday s restaurant at knott s in july of the increase in attendance in was led by strong performances from dorney park and michigan s adventure  both of which introduced successful new attractions this season  and our two midwest water parks  which benefited from a hot  dry summer 
these gains helped offset attendance shortfalls at our cedar point  valleyfair and worlds of fun amusement parks 
for the year  combined attendance at our seven amusement parks was unchanged at million guests  and attendance at our five water parks totaled million guests  up between years 
the increase in our average in park guest per capita spending level in was principally due to increased admission revenues at our amusement parks 
excluding depreciation and all other non cash charges  total operating costs and expenses in increased  or million  to million from million in this was primarily due to the additional operating costs and expenses of geauga lake  which was acquired in april  and the incremental operating costs of castaway bay  which opened in november as a percent of revenues  operating costs decreased between years 
after depreciation and a million non cash charge for unit options  operating income in increased 
table of contents to million from million a year ago 
this increase is primarily attributable to the strong results at knott s berry farm and dorney park 
in  adjusted ebitda increased  or million  to million  in large part due to improved operating results at knott s berry farm 
increased attendance and strong operating results at dorney park and michigan s adventure also contributed nicely 
our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in increased to from in  with adjusted ebitda margins improving at all of our parks due to a continued focus on controlling operating costs and expenses 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge related to the change in fair value of two of our interest rate swap agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges under the applicable accounting rules 
this amount reversed into income over the life of the swaps as they continued to serve the purpose of leveling cash interest costs 
in  we recognized a non cash credit of  for the change in fair value of the swaps as they expired in the first quarter 
this compared to a non cash credit of million in these amounts are aggregated with interest expense in the accompanying table 
after non cash credits  interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared to net income of million  or per unit  in reflected in the provision for taxes is the reversal of million of contingent liabilities recorded from through related to ptp taxes 
the accrual was established when the ptp taxes first came into effect  because we could not be certain at that time how the taxes would be applied 
now after a number of years of filing returns  we have more complete evidence as to how the taxes are imposed  including the completion of examinations of our tax filings 
based on this evidence  we determined that the accrual was no longer required and reversed the million of contingent liabilities back into income in the adjustment to the ptp tax accrual  which was partially offset by ptp taxes payable for the year and the impact of the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries  resulted in a net credit for taxes of million  which is composed of a million credit and a million provision  for the ptp tax and income taxes  respectively 
it is important to note that since this is a reversal of a previously recorded accrual  it has no affect on our cash flow in the current period 
excluding the impact of reversing the ptp tax accrual and computing a accrual consistent with the treatment applied in  net income for the year would have been million  or per diluted limited partner unit  up million  or  from liquidity and capital resources we ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business offset somewhat by the recent refinancing of debt due to the acquisition of ppi on june  further discussion of this transaction can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the operation of the newly acquired parks  substantially offset by higher cash interest payments 
in  net cash from operating activities increased million to million from million in this increase reflects an increase in operating profit of million between years  offset by changes in working capital and higher cash interest payments 

table of contents investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our park and resort properties 
during  net cash used for investing activities totaled  million  compared to million in and million in the significant increase in net cash for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of ppi 
the amount reported in includes the acquisition of geauga lake 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  including the addition of world class roller coasters at cedar point  kings island and valleyfair 
the program will also include new water attractions at kings dominion and a new spinning coaster at knott s berry farm 
in addition to adding great new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including additional rides and attractions  restaurant renovations  new games and other general improvements 
we believe the combination of a strong capital program  our first full year of operating the newly acquired parks  and our continued focus on guest service  will improve attendance  per capita and operating results company wide in however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance 
financing activities net cash from financing activities totaled  million in  compared to net cash utilized of million in and net cash from financing activities of million in the significant increase in cash from financing activities is attributable to higher borrowings to fund the ppi acquisition 
capital resources in june  and as amended in august  in connection with the acquisition of ppi we entered into a new  million credit agreement with several banks and certain lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
in february  we took advantage of favorable market conditions and amended the credit agreement  reducing interest rate spreads on the term borrowings by basis points bps 
the bps reduction in interest rate is expected to save us approximately million in cash interest costs annually 
the credit facilities provided under the credit agreement include a  million us term loan  million in us revolving loan commitments  a million canadian term loan and million in canadian revolving loan commitments 
under the amended agreement  us denominated loans made under the us and canadian revolving loan commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on libor plus bps 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian revolving commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on bankers acceptance plus bps 
all term debt currently bears interest at either a rate based on libor plus bps or a rate based on a prime rate plus bps 
the us term loan matures on august  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the canadian term loan matures on february  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the us revolving commitment and the canadian revolving commitment expire on august  the credit agreement also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 

table of contents at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt and million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
during  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted billion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of  after taking into account the february amendment to the credit agreement 
during we also entered into two cross currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk exposure on term debt borrowings related to our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
in february  we terminated the two cross currency swaps and received million in cash upon termination 
we replaced these swaps with two new cross currency swap agreements  which effectively convert million of term debt  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
of the total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at year end for variable rate debt  cash interest payments for would total approximately million  higher than interest paid in  which included only six months of interest payments from the acquisition of the paramount parks 
in addition  cash distributions in  at the current rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet working capital needs  debt service  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations on an undiscounted basis at december  in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital expenditures lease other obligations total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all debt

represents contractual obligations in place at year end for the purchase of new rides and attractions 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  represents contractual lease and purchase obligations in place at year end 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents at december    million or of our outstanding long term debt had been converted to fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swap agreements and cross currency interest rate swap agreements as discussed in capital resources above and million represented variable rate debt 
assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt would be approximately million as of december  except for its cross currency interest rate swap agreements  which hedge a substantial portion of its canadian subsidiary s debt  the partnership is exposed to foreign currency translation on its operations in canada 
the partnership does not expect currency translation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates  which although not tied directly to federal and state minimum wage laws  do follow those wage trends 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
