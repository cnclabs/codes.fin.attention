table of contents off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease

table of contents critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
grain inventories the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the grain inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in market value are recorded as merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
because the company marks to market inventories and sales commitments  gross profit on a grain sale transaction is recognized when a contract for sale of the grain is executed 
the related revenue is recognized upon shipment of the grain  at which time title transfers and customer acceptance occurs 
grain inventories contain valuation reserves established to recognize the difference in quality and value between contractual grades and the actual quality grades of inventory held by the company 
these quality reserves also require management to exercise judgment 
impairment of long lived assets the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets that may be impacted 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms

while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
employee benefit plans the company provides all full time  non retail employees with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
in  the company amended its defined benefit pension plans effective january  the provisions of this amendment include freezing benefits for the retail line of business employees as of december   modifying the calculation of benefits for the non retail line of business employees as of december  with future benefits to be calculated using a new career average formula and in the case of all employees  compensation for the years through will be includable in the final average pay formula calculating the final benefit earned for years prior to december  stock compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r using the black scholes method of valuation 
the company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forefeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used were to change significantly  or if a different valuation model were used  stock based compensation expense may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company follows a policy of hedging its inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the instruments used are exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
in addition  inventory values are affected by the month to month spread relationships in the regulated futures markets  as the company carries inventories over time 
these spread relationships are also less volatile than the overall market value and tend to follow historical patterns but also represent a risk that cannot be directly hedged 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options hedges  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows 
table of contents december in thousands net long position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of less than carrying value market risk
