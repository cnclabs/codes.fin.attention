the following review of tesco s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview business we are a global leader in the design  manufacture and service of technology based solutions for the upstream energy industry 
we seek to change the way people drill wells by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add real value by reducing the costs of drilling for and producing oil and gas 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we organize our activities into two business segments  top drive and casing services  and our financial and operating data are presented consistent with that structure 
the top drive business comprises top drive sales  top drive rentals and after market sales and service 
the casing services business includes casing drilling and tubular services 
during the third quarter of  we determined that the company no longer qualified for foreign private issuer status related to periodic reporting of its financial results with the us securities and exchange commission sec 
as a result  we were required to prepare and file this annual report on form k to report our annual results beginning with the year ended december  and will file quarterly reports on form q for our future quarterly results thereafter 
prior to january  our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in canada 
however  in conjunction with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we have retroactively restated our results of operations and financial position for all years presented herein to present our primary financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
effective january   we adopted the us dollar as our reporting currency since a majority of our revenue is closely tied to the us dollar and also to facilitate comparability to other oil and gas service companies 
in conjunction with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we have retroactively restated our results of operations and financial position for all years presented herein to us dollars 
unless indicated otherwise  all amounts in these consolidated financial statements are denominated in united states us dollars 
all references to us or to are to us dollars and references to c are to canadian dollars 
business environment strong oil and gas drilling activity in continued to provide significant opportunities for us to expand our customer base 
one of the key indicators of our business is the number of active drilling rigs 
the average annual number of active drilling rigs excluding rigs drilling in russia or onshore china for which reliable estimates are not available is as follows years ended december  united states canada latin america including mexico europe  africa and middle east asia pacific worldwide average source baker hughes rig count in the last quarter of  north america experienced a decrease in rig activity in canada and shallow drilling in the us due to the recent decline in natural gas prices 
however the international markets did not show any sign of weakening 
we continued our emphasis of increasing revenues and operating income outside of north america to create a more balanced portfolio between the north american natural gas driven market and the international oil market 
our financial performance in as measured in revenues and operating income for both business segments  in north america and throughout the rest of the world  reflects this change in focus that has been made over the last few years 
for example  revenues outside of north america consisting of canada  mexico and the us increased over to million as compared to during  we delivered new top drive units to customers  compared to new units delivered to customers in we ended with a backlog of top drive units compared to a backlog of units at 
table of contents 
index to financial statements december  we consider an order as a backlog unit when the customer has signed a purchase contract  submitted the purchase order and  if required by the purchase agreement  paid a non refundable deposit 
going into  we intend to continue to concentrate on lowering manufacturing costs while maintaining the capacity to deliver top drive units into the market each quarter  assuming sustained market demand and orders 
we continue to see expanding support for our tubular services business and based on recent successes in casing drilling projects  will begin an aggressive expansion plan of this business line over the next several years 
we are particularly focused on moving strongly into the offshore markets 
stock option review in december  our board of directors and management conducted a self initiated review of our past stock option granting practices and related accounting 
the review of our stock option practices did not uncover any evidence of fraud or manipulative intent 
however  we concluded that we had improperly accounted for stock compensation expense for certain stock option grants and  as a result  determined that the total pre tax impact to correct these miscalculations was million  of which million relates to years prior to and is discussed in prior year errors and adjustments to retained earnings below  million relates to and is included in our results and million relates to future periods 
the results of our review were also reported to regulatory authorities and the toronto stock exchange and the nasdaq global market 
the toronto stock exchange has made additional inquiries concerning the review  we have responded to those inquiries and are otherwise cooperating fully 
additionally  due to this item and other misstatements identified in preparing our annual consolidated financial statements  we filed restated financial reports for our second quarterly period ended june  and third quarterly period ended september

this increase is primarily due to increased activities in the top drive segment  particularly top drive sales and after market support due to the substantial increase in the top drive unit sales and strong increases in casing services revenue 
increased revenues in both of these business segments are discussed in further detail below 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased activities in both of our business segments and improved margins in top drives offset by increased costs in our research and engineering segment and increased selling  general and administrative expenses which are discussed in further detail below

during  we sold top drive units  of which were new units and were used units 
the selling price per unit varies significantly depending on the model  whether the unit was previously operated in our rental fleet and whether a power unit was included in the sale 
when top drive units in our rental fleet are sold  the sales proceeds are included in revenues and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services 
revenues related to the sale of used units sold in and were million and million  respectively 
in addition to selling top drive units  we provide after market sales and service to support our installed base 
during  efforts to establish service and parts centers  including sales personnel  in strategic locations closer to the installed base increased after market sales and service revenues 
second  revenues from top drive rental activities increased to million as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the number of operating days  higher average rental rates and increased stand by revenues 
the number of top drive operating days and average daily operating rates for and and the number of rental units in our fleet at year end and were years ended december  number of operating days average daily operating rates number of units in rental fleet  end of year we define an operating day as a day that a unit in our rental fleet is under contract and operating 
we do not include stand by days in our definition of an operating day 
a stand by day is a day in which we are paid an amount  which may be less than the full contract rate  to have a top drive rental unit available to a customer but that unit is not operating 
in  stand by revenues from rental operations increased million to million due to demand for our top drive rental units 
operating income top drive operating income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to like the increase in revenue of this same time period  this growth is primarily driven by the increase in the number of top drive units sold in compared to units in compared to units in and an increase in top drive rental activities primarily due to increased fleet utilization resulting in an increased number of rental days and higher average rental rates partially offset by increased operating costs related to our manufacturing operations  including amounts expensed for inventory obsolescence 
top drive s operating income was negatively impacted by a million charge related to the replacement of load path parts of certain equipment sold to customers and in our rental fleet 
this charge was net of amounts contractually recoverable from the manufacturer of the steel forgings used to make such load path parts

tubular services revenue is principally generated from our conventional casing and tubing business  including our multi control line running systems mclrs activities and proprietary casing running technology 
the conventional tubular services generated revenue of million in  an increase of million from the increase in conventional tubular services revenues is primarily due to the two acquisitions in november and increased activities

additionally  we identified other accounting errors relating to prior years 
we evaluated these prior year accounting errors using guidance provided under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatement the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect on prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
prior to our application of the guidance in sab no 
 we used the roll over method for quantifying financial statement misstatements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in sab no 
 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of our financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures using a dual approach of both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
as these adjustments are not material to any of the years prior to under the roll over method  we have elected to apply the guidance in sab no 
by adjusting the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment of million recorded to retained earnings as of such date  as the cumulative amount of these errors would have been material to the year prior to adoption of sab no 
the following table summarizes the effects as of january  of applying the guidance in sab no

b we did not properly calculate the fair value of certain stock option grants to employees and we did not properly account for modifications of grants related to certain previously terminated employees 
as a result of this error  stock compensation expense was understated with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus 
we recorded a million increase in capital surplus with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings to correct this misstatement 
c we did not properly calculate depreciation expense for certain casing services equipment acquired in as a result of this error depreciation expense was understated 
we recorded a million decrease in property  plant and equipment  net with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings to correct this misstatement 
d we improperly deferred certain costs to be billed to a customer which were not included in the service agreement 
as a result of this error cost of sales and services were understated 
we recorded a million decrease in accounts receivable with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings to correct this misstatement

index to financial statements litigation and contingencies in the normal course of our business  we are subject to legal proceedings brought against us and our subsidiaries 
none of these proceedings involves a claim for damages exceeding ten percent of the current assets of tesco and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
varco i p  inc varco filed suit against us in april in the us district court for the western district of louisiana  alleging that our cds infringes certain of varco s us patents 
we filed a countersuit against varco in june in the us district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
in july  the louisiana case was transferred to the federal district court in houston  and as a result  the issues raised by varco have been consolidated into a single proceeding in which we are the plaintiff 
we also filed a request with the us patent and trademark office for reexamination of the patent on which varco s claim of infringement is based 
the us patent and trademark office has accepted the varco patent for reexamination  and that reexamination remains in process 
the district court has granted our motion to stay the infringement litigation pending the outcome of the reexamination 
the outcome and amounts of any future financial impacts from this litigation are not determinable at this time 
franks international  inc franks filed suit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  marshall division  on january   alleging that our cds infringes two patents held by franks 
we have filed a general denial and the case is in early stages of analysis and discovery 
the outcome and amounts of any future financial impacts from this litigation are not determinable at this time 
we have been advised by mexican tax authorities that they believe significant expenses incurred by our mexican operations are not deductible for mexican tax purposes 
formal reassessments disallowing these deductions have been issued in respect of through all of these reassessments have been appealed to the mexican court system  and we continue to believe that the basis for these reassessments is incorrect 
in october  the mexican supreme court denied our appeal of the mexican tax reassessment 
as a result of this and previous court decisions  a revised reassessment may be calculated by mexican authorities and will be subject to our appeal 
no such reassessment has been issued at the time of this filing 
there is some uncertainty as to the final amount of the reassessment 
in  we estimated that the total exposure for was million and recorded a charge of million to other expense relating to the interest and penalties and million to income tax expense during we have previously paid approximately million for  which is included as a long term receivable in intangible and other assets 
we will request a refund of any difference between the amount paid and the amount finally determined to be owing for although the reassessments in respect of  and were decided in our favor  our mexican tax advisors have indicated that the tax authorities have the right to recommence audit proceedings and issue new reassessments at any time until years become statute barred 
we understand that these years become statute barred over the period through we have received no indication from the mexican tax authorities of their intentions with respect to these years  and management is unable to predict on what grounds the tax authorities may issue further reassessments or estimate the amount of any additional taxes that may be claimed 
the reassessment for is currently before the mexican tax court 
management estimates that the current maximum exposure to the company  including taxes  interest and penalties  in respect of the reassessment is approximately million 
this amount will be recorded as a charge against income should we be unsuccessful in overturning the remaining reassessment 
in  mexican tax authorities formally requested information from us regarding expenses we deducted in and at the time of this filing  no reassessments have been received for these years and management is unable to predict the outcome of this review or estimate the amount of any additional taxes that may be claimed as owed

index to financial statements in july  we received a claim for withholding tax  penalties and interest related to payments over the periods from to in a foreign jurisdiction 
we disagree with this claim and are currently litigating this matter 
however  at june  we accrued our estimated pre tax exposure on this matter at million  with million included in other expense and million included in interest expense 
also in early july  we received notice of a court order of first instance with respect to commercial litigation in the middle east 
the dispute involves a claim for a portion of the net income arising from our operation of certain equipment in the region 
the court awarded payment to the claimant in an amount of approximately million 
this award was upheld on appeal in december we have appealed this decision to the maximum judicial authority in the country 
during we accrued the full amount for this claim in cost of sales and services expense 
the estimates above represent our best estimates based on consultation with internal and external legal counsel 
there can be no assurance as to the eventual outcome or the amount of loss we may suffer as a result of these proceedings

liquidity and capital resources our net cash and cash equivalents or debt position as of december  and was as follows in thousands years ended december  cash current portion of long term debt and capital lease long term debt and capital lease net cash debt the increase in net debt during was primarily the result of manufacturing investment required by the company to manufacture the top drives in its backlog 
in november  we entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  the credit agreement that provided the company with million in term loans the term loan and million in combined revolver and swingline loans with a maximum of million on the swingline portion the revolver 
amounts outstanding under the term loan are required to be repaid in quarterly installments beginning on january  the original maturity schedule required quarterly payments of million  which have been reduced to million due to certain prepayments 
amounts outstanding under the revolver are due on october  borrowings under the revolver are capped at the lesser of million or the sum of of the company s trade accounts receivables plus of the company s inventory balance 
additionally  amounts available under the revolver are reduced by letters of credit issued under the credit agreement not to exceed million and amounts outstanding under the swingline loan provisions of the revolver 
at december   we did not have any amount outstanding under the swingline loan provisions of the revolver 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement and we had million available under the revolver 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we are prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness over million  paying cash dividends to shareholders and other restrictions which are standard to the industry 
we are required to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreement in certain circumstances

on occasion  we are involved in specific environmental claims  including the remediation of properties we own or have operated  as well as efforts to meet or correct compliance related matters 
our health  safety and environment group has programs in place to maintain environmental compliance and to prevent the occurrence of environmental contamination 
we do not expect costs related to these remediation activities to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

significant accounting policies the preparation and presentation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates that significantly affect the results of operations and financial position reflected in the financial statements 
in making these estimates  management applies accounting policies and principles that it believes will provide the most meaningful and reliable financial reporting 
management considers the most significant of these estimates and their impact to be foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for most of the company s worldwide operations 
for foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency  specifically the company s canadian operations  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at end of period exchange rates  and the resultant translation adjustments are reported  net of their related tax effects  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency prior to translation into us dollars  and the resultant exchange gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
income and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the period 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete and collectibility is reasonably assured 
tesco recognizes revenues when title  risk of loss and physical possession of the equipment is transferred to the customer  with no right of return 
for sales transactions where title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer but the supporting documentation does not meet all of the criteria for revenue recognition prior to the product being in the physical possession of the customer  the recognition of the revenues and related inventory costs from their transactions are required to be deferred until the customer takes physical possession of the equipment 
for service and rental activities  tesco recognizes revenues as the services are rendered based upon agreed daily  hourly or job rates 
the company provides product warranties on equipment sold pursuant to manufacturing contracts and provides for the anticipated cost of its warranties in cost of sales when sales revenue is recognized 
the accrual of warranty costs is an estimate based upon historical experience and upon specific warranty issues as they arise 
the company periodically reviews its warranty provision to assess its adequacy in the light of actual warranty costs incurred 
because the warranty accrual is an estimate  it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on the company s financial statements

index to financial statements deferred revenues the company generally requires customers to pay a non refundable deposit for a portion of sales price for top drive units with their order 
these customer deposits are deferred until the customer takes title  risk of loss and physical possession of the product 
accounting for stock options the company recognizes compensation expense on options granted to employees and directors 
this compensation expense is based on the theoretical fair value of each option at its grant date  the estimation of which requires management to make assumptions about the future volatility of the company s stock price  future interest rates and the timing of employees decisions to exercise their options 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and grants credit based upon past payment history  financial condition and anticipated industry conditions 
customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations and overall industry conditions 
many of the company s customers are located in international areas that are inherently subject to risks of economic  political and civil instabilities  which may impact management s ability to collect those accounts receivable 
the main factors in determining the allowance needed for accounts receivable are customer bankruptcies  delinquency  and management s estimate of ability to collect 
excess and obsolete inventory provisions quantities of inventory on hand are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain active part numbers and the quantities on hand are not excessive based on usage patterns and known changes to equipment or processes 
significant or unanticipated changes in business conditions could impact the amount and timing of any additional provision for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and intangible and other assets  comprise a substantial portion of the company s assets 
the carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this requires management to forecast future cash flows to be derived from the utilization of these assets based upon assumptions about future business conditions or technological developments 
significant  unanticipated changes in circumstances could make these assumptions invalid and require changes to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets 
income taxes the company uses the liability method which takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions  assets and liabilities 
future tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
valuation allowances are established to reduce future tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the tax asset will not be realized 
estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning have been considered in assessing the utilization of available tax losses and credits 
changes in circumstances  assumptions and clarification of uncertain tax regimes may require changes to any valuation allowances associated with the company s future tax assets

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatement the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
prior to the company s application of the guidance in sab no 
 the company used the roll over method for quantifying financial statement misstatements 
in sab no 
 the sec staff established in approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures using a dual approach of both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
as these adjustments were not material to any of the years prior to under the roll over method  we have elected to apply the guidance in sab no 
by adjusting the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment of million recorded to retained earnings as of such date  as the cumulative amount of these errors would have been material to the year prior to the adoption of sab no 
a description of the misstatements and the years effected are summarized in prior year errors and adjustments to retained earnings

reconciliation of us to canadian gaap significant differences between us and canadian gaap are described below 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  prior to january  our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with canadian gaap 
however  in conjunction with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we have retroactively restated our results of operations and financial position for all years presented herein to be in compliance with us gaap 
a reconciliation of our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheet between us and canadian gaap is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the principal differences that result in material measurement changes in our consolidated financial statements between us and canadian gaap are a product development costs costs of product development that are required to be expensed in the period incurred under us gaap are capitalized and amortized under canadian gaap 
b investment in marketable securities of affiliates under us gaap  marketable securities held as portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at market value at the balance sheet date 
for securities identified as available for sale  us gaap requires that unrealized gains and losses are reflected in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  under canadian gaap unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in income 
c reduction of capital in november  the company reduced its share capital by million to eliminate its accumulated deficit by reducing share capital 
us gaap does not allow the reduction of capital to be shown in our consolidated financial statements 
however  canadian gaap allows the reduction of capital to be shown in financial statements 
d adoption of a us accounting principle during the preparation of these financial statements and the review of our stock option granting practices  we determined that we had improperly accounted for stock compensation expense for certain stock option grants in prior years and identified other accounting errors also relating to prior years 
for us gaap  because these adjustments were not material to any of the years prior to under the roll over method  we elected to apply the guidance in sab no 
by adjusting the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment of million recorded to retained earnings as of such date 
however  under canadian gaap the cumulative effect method allowed by sab no 
is not permitted 
therefore prior year reported amounts have been adjusted to reflect the correction of these misstatements in the applicable year to which they relate 
in  and  the primary differences between net income loss under us gaap and canadian gaap is related to the amortization of product development costs  the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on the turnkey warrants and the prior year errors discussed in prior year errors and adjustment to retained earnings that are reflected in the results for the year in which they relate 
these differences in net income did not materially impact the discussion of results of operations discussed above

we are committed to expanding its role as a leading service provider to the drilling industry 
all of our services and products are delivered through geographic business units to provide customers with a single point of contact for all of our products and services 
in the last quarter of  north america experienced a decrease in rig activity in canada and shallow drilling in the us due to the decline in natural gas prices 
however the international markets did not show any sign of weakening 
we continued our emphasis of increasing revenues and operating income outside of north america to create a more balanced portfolio between the north american natural gas driven market and the international oil market 
going into  we intend to continue to concentrate on lowering manufacturing costs while maintaining the capacity to deliver top drive units into the market each quarter  assuming sustained market demand and orders 
related to the top drive segment  we will be introducing new electric and hydraulic models in and as our installed base has increased  we are focusing on increasing our after market sales and service activities 
regarding the rental fleet  we are evaluating the placement of units throughout the world due to the recent decline in drilling activity in north america 
additionally  we are implementing a plan to revitalize our rental fleet through selective sale and replacement of older units 
we continue to see expanding support for our tubular services business and based on recent successes in casing drilling projects  will begin an aggressive expansion plan of this business line over the next several years

we have reviewed these items  which are included in intangible and other assets  by reference to their terms  including rates of interest earned  and determined that their fair value is not materially different than their carrying value 
the fair value of our long term debt depends primarily on current market interest rates for debt issued with similar maturities by companies with risk profiles similar to ours
