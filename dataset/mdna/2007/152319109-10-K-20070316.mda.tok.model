overview centillium communications  inc centillium or the company designs  develops and supplies highly integrated programmable system on a chip soc solutions that enable high speed broadband access  which is the delivery of high capacity bandwidth to consumers and enterprises for networking of data  voice and video signals 
our soc products incorporate digital and mixed signal semiconductors and related software 
we serve the digital subscriber line dsl  voice over internet protocol voip and fiber to the premises fttp  which is also known as optical networking  markets 
our dsl business currently comprises our asymmetric dsl adsl  products 
the next generation of our dsl products comprises our vdsl products 
our customers are systems vendors and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that sell dsl and optical network equipment  for deployment in central offices and customer premises  and voip equipment  for use in carrier class and enterprise class gateways and consumer telephony applications 
trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of broadband access infrastructure equipment  and we rely on oems to select our products over our competitors products to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
the sales cycle of our products is lengthy and typically involves a detailed initial technical evaluation of our products by our prospective customers  followed by the design  construction and testing of prototypes incorporating our products 
our focus is on design  development  sales and marketing 
we outsource our semiconductor fabrication  assembly and test functions 
we currently market and sell through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives in the asia pacific region  europe  and north america 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since inception and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows in the near term 
in our net revenues were million  compared with million in  a decrease of 
we experienced a significant revenue decline in the japan adsl market in our net loss in was million  compared with million in however  due to the expected continued decline in japan adsl revenues  we expect our net loss to significantly increase as the cycle time between our new product introductions and revenue from those new products will not occur until at least mid since inception  our net revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of our adsl products to two customers in japan 
these two customers are nec corporation  or nec  and sumitomo electric industries  ltd  or sumitomo 
the adsl new subscriber market in japan shrank dramatically in  and and this trend has continued to have a severe adverse impact on our financial performance 
our japan adsl revenues declined  and in  and  respectively 
we expect that the new subscriber rate in japan in will be lower than the rate experienced in we expect that our adsl business will grow outside japan in  which is anticipated to partially offset the dramatic decline in japan 
we must achieve substantial revenue growth and continue to control expenses to improve our financial position 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on how successful we are in diversifying our dsl business to markets outside of japan and diversifying our business by penetrating the vdsl  voip and fttp markets 
we have recently introduced our next generation dsl products  which are very high data rate dsl  or vdsl  products 
we anticipate that they will begin to contribute to revenues starting in the second half of based on feedback from our customers in japan  asia  north america and europe  we are believe that our arion products  with our extremevdsl technology  have high performance in power consumption  data rates  reach and interoperability 
our vdsl products are in laboratory evaluations at several customers 
however  there can be no assurance that our product will meet customer requirements now or in the future and that even if they do meet these requirements  that our customers will purchase our product 
our voip revenues vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we expect our net revenues from voip in the first quarter of to increase as the demand from one of our largest voip customers has strengthened 
our expansion with the palladia tm product family  which delivers the industry s first integrated voip solution for the adsl market is recently in production 
our fttp revenues were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
growth  if any  in our fttp revenues in and beyond is dependent on qualification of our next generation fttp product and the purchase of significant quantities of these products by our customers 
for instance  one such customer in japan  which we had previously expected to account for a significant percentage of this growth  declined to purchase product because product did not meet a previously waived requirement 
we developed our next generation fttp product to meet the new and comprehensive feature requirements demanded by a major service provider in japan 
our new fttp product  the mustang chipset  is currently in the qualification process at a large service provider in japan 
we currently anticipate this major japanese telecommunications service provider will complete its evaluation of our initial next generation product by mid since our fttp pon products are primarily targeted at the japanese market  if we are not successful with this customer  it could lead us to decide to scale down or exit our optical product line 
this could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for and would impair our growth prospects 
even if we are successful in convincing this japanese customer to accept our new fttp pon product  we may be required to incur further product development and support expenses  and do not expect to recognize any appreciable revenues from this product until the third quarter of at the earliest 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our product will meet customer requirements now or in the future and that even if they do meet these requirements  that our customers will purchase our product 
from to  we reduced our operating expenses  primarily in research and development by conducting more of our research and development in india  where costs are substantially lower than in the united states 
however  these costs are beginning to rise significantly due to the growth in india s economy 
moreover  our ability to attract and retain the necessary qualified engineers is becoming more difficult due to increased competition for these engineers 
our net loss decreased by approximately million  or  to a net loss of million for as compared to million for in  we recorded total charges of million for surplus space in a building at our fremont  california location  which we abandoned 
in addition during  we recorded a million charge for licensed software  which was written off as this software is not expected to have future alternative uses 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our organization by implementing a workforce reduction and terminating a million license for certain software design tools 
we also cancelled certain development programs to better focus on opportunities that we believed to have greater potential 
the total expense related to the reduction in force was million  of which million related to research and development personnel 
these initiatives coupled with a increase in revenues  an increase in the gross margin and further expense reductions resulted in a significant decrease in our net loss for we have continued to experience high employee turnover within our marketing and engineering groups that could have a negative affect on us and our ability to achieve our plans 
moreover  it will take time and substantial resources to replace these employees and there is no assurance that we will be able to attract sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified employees 
we have traditionally sold our products on the basis of our standard terms and conditions 
we are increasingly being required to enter into purchase agreements with key customers and potential customers as a condition to doing business with them 
these agreements shift significantly more risk and cost on to us 
doing business under terms of this nature could increase our costs  cause us to bear greater inventory risk and increase our liabilities  which could materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our planned actions for are based on certain assumptions concerning the adoption of broadband technologies  the rate of adsl subscriber growth  the successful deployment of our vdsl products  the successful qualification and deployment of our fttp products in japan  the ramp of our voip products and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if economic or market conditions deteriorate to an unexpected degree  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our revenues  profitability  financial position and cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus  including a possible transition out of one or more of our product lines  and restructuring our business to realign our resources and reduce our expenses 
moreover  as our quarterly net revenues for the first quarter of are expected to be only slightly higher compared to revenues for the fourth quarter of  we anticipate that both our losses and cash used in operations will continue 
while we believe that existing cash and short term investments will be sufficient to support our current operations for the next twelve months  that cannot be assured 
this belief is based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and if any of those assumptions proves to be inaccurate or if our cash flows from operations do not meet our expectations  our cash and short term investments could be inadequate to meet our liquidity requirements 
for example  we have assumed that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and will achieve market acceptance  but there is no guarantee that this will happen 
we also have significant litigation risk  and if we are required to make any substantial payments due to adverse results in litigation  this could seriously affect our liquidity and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other risks that could cause our actual cash position to vary are set forth above  under item a risk factors  of this report 
our operating results for and beyond have been and will continue to be materially affected by additional stock based compensation expense 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  or sfas r  which we adopted effective january   we must reflect the fair value of stock options and other stock based awards as an expense in our financial statements 
we anticipate that these stock based compensation charges will continue to be material to our future operating results 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock based awards  as determined by sfas r using the assumptions we had in effect as of that date  was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of  that total cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average period of years 
we believe that the annual grant of restricted stock units to our employees in the fourth quarter of and the annual combination grant of restricted stock and options to our officers will better facilitate our efforts to retain and motivate our employees and officers compared to the use of only stock options 
net revenues in  and  adsl revenues accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  and  nec accounted for  and and sumitomo accounted for  and of net revenues  respectively 
lucent technologies accounted for and of net revenues in and  respectively 
marconi acquired by ericsson in january accounted for of our net revenues in no other customer accounted for or more of our net revenues during the years ended december   and while our sales have historically been denominated in us dollars  major fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our customers demand for our products as most of our major customers are foreign entities 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
additionally  this cycle may be as long as to months for certain voip and fttp products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  marketing and selling  and investment in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenues  if any 
we anticipate that the rate of orders will vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high or low  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
this volatility may become more pronounced as we continue to attempt to increase the proportion of total sales generated by our newer voip and fttp products 
competition and technological change in the rapidly evolving dsl  voip and optical networking markets have influenced  and may continue to influence our quarterly and annual net revenues and results of operations 
average selling prices of our products tend to be higher at the time of introduction and decline over time due to competitive pressures 
we expect this pattern to continue with existing and future products 
our average selling prices are also impacted by our customer and product mix 
we are increasingly selling into certain markets where pricing is very competitive 
as a result  our gross margins are lower in these markets 
if the gross profit generated from these markets is not sufficient to offset the cost of business in these markets  this may have a negative impact on our financial results 
cost of revenues we are a fabless semiconductor company we outsource the wafer fabrication  assembly and testing of our products 
our cost of revenues primarily consists of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalties  overhead associated with procurement and production engineering  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and product warranty costs 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of employee compensation including stock compensation expense and related personnel expenses  fees paid to consultants  non recurring engineering  prototype costs  evaluation and testing of pre production parts and engineering design tools 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employee compensation including stock compensation expense and related personnel expenses in sales and marketing  product marketing  applications engineering  and corporate functions including accounting  finance  legal  human resources and information systems 
due to the complexities of the litigation to which we are a party and the high cost of defending legal proceedings in general  we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses in our defense of these cases for the foreseeable future 
interest income and other  net interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r effective january  sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in operating results 
we recognize the stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees  which generally equals the vesting period of the stock based award 
prior to january   we followed accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock compensation 
we elected the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas r 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of part ii of this annual report for information regarding centillium s treatment of share based compensation  including information regarding the accounting treatment for share based compensation prior to centillium s adoption of sfas r 
provision for income taxes the provision for income tax expense was  in   in and  in the provisions for income taxes relate primarily to current taxes payable for income generated by our subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards for us federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  as of that date 
the federal net operating losses and federal tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
california net operating losses and tax credits of million expired in and the remaining balances will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards before full utilization 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because we do not believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  warranty and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products have been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the price is fixed or determinable 
if sales arrangements contain customer specific acceptance requirements  revenue is deferred and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
stock compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r effective january  sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in operating results 
sfas r is a new and very complex accounting standard 
applying this standard requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes option pricing model assumptions  such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates to value equity based compensation 
these assumptions and estimates are subject to change over time  which may affect the related stock based compensation expenses that we recognize in our financial statements 
sales returns and allowances upon shipment of our products  we establish a provision for estimated returns 
under certain circumstances  we allow our customers to return products and a provision is made for such returns 
our estimate of product returns is based on contractual terms or sales agreements  historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net revenues and gross profit  should we experience increased product returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost  or net realizable value 
cost is based on a first in  first out basis 
we perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories  both on hand and those we are committed to purchase  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
currently  we use a nine month rolling forecast based on the type of products  anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog 
we compare our current or committed inventory levels to these forecasts on a regular basis and any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased write downs  resulting in decreased gross profit 
in the event we experience unanticipated demand and are able to sell previously written down inventories  gross profit will increase 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products  generally for a period of one year  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacing chipsets  rework costs and freight incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
we periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty liability and adjust such amounts as necessary 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims or are involved in litigation in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights as well as breach of contract and other claims 
when the liability is probable and estimable  we have accrued estimates of the amounts we expect to pay upon resolution of such matters 
depending on developments in these matters  these estimates may change and may result in increased accruals  resulting in decreased profit or decreased accruals  resulting in increased profit  respectively 
the above items are not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles with no need for our management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss interest income and other  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss less than years ended december  and net revenues the following table presents net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit in thousands except for percentages year ended year ended december  december  of net of net increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change net revenues    cost of revenues  gross profit  our revenues are generated principally by sales of our dsl  voip and fttp products

revenues from our dsl products accounted for million  or  of net revenues in  as compared to million  or  of net revenues in the decline in dsl revenues was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of new adsl subscribers in japan as compared to  and to a lesser extent  by a decrease in the average selling price of our dsl products 
average selling prices of products are expected to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
total revenues from japan comprised and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
japan s dsl market has been an important part of our business  and new adsl subscribers in japan have been a significant driver of consumption for centillium s dsl products 
therefore  the continuing decreasing number of new adsl subscribers in japan will likely continue to impact our future revenues 
dsl revenues from japan decreased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in revenues from voip products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of net revenues  respectively 
the decline in voip revenues was primarily due to a substantial decrease in our voip cpe shipments partially offset by an increase of voip co shipments 
our voip revenues vary significantly from quarter to quarter as they are currently derived from only a few customers which have varying deployment schedules and testing requirements 
we expect that our voip revenues will increase in the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  as demand from one of our largest voip customers has strengthened and several new customers are ordering our voip products 
revenues from our fttp products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of net revenues  respectively 
growth in fttp revenues  if any  is highly dependent on the successful execution of our longer term fttp strategy  successful qualification of our fttp products and the purchase of significant quantities of these products by our customers 
we currently have our new fttp product in the qualification process at a large service provider in japan 
however  future revenue from this service provider is dependent on successful completion of this qualification process and we expect the results by mid at the earliest 
the following customers  the first two of which are located in japan  accounted for more than of net revenues for and years ended december  nec sumitomo marconi corporation plc lucent less than acquired by ericsson in january gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less the cost of revenues 
gross profit decreased by million  to million in from million in the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower dsl and voip revenues and write downs of excess inventory of million partially offset by lower wafer  assembly and test costs  as well as improved yields 
the gross margin remained steady at in compared to  respectively 
the gross margin in was negatively impacted by due to the write downs of excess inventory 
our future gross profit margins may be affected by pricing pressures from our customers and competitors  fluctuations in unit volume  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs  changes in the costs charged by our assembly and test subcontractors  changes in product mix and further write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  among other factors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in the million decrease resulted primarily from million decrease in depreciation expense  million in lower employee compensation and related expenses  million decrease in consultants  million in lower facility related expenses and million in higher subsidy from the french government  partially offset by increases of million in engineering evaluation board and pre production expenses and million in higher stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r 
the decreased expenses in employee compensation and related expenses were primarily attributable to significantly lower headcount in the united states 
however  we expect research and development expenses in to be higher than in as we anticipate a higher level of program development 
we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology in the broadband communications markets in which we operate 
we hold us patents and foreign patents  and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in the broadband communications field 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased by to million from million in the million decrease was primarily due to the million charges for surplus space that we incurred in  million in lower employee compensation and related expenses primarily due to significantly lower headcount in the united states  reductions of million in commissions  and million in lower administration expense  partially offset by million higher stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r and million in increased legal expenses 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses in will stay approximately flat in absolute dollars if we are able to maintain our legal expenses at the same level as despite our ongoing litigation  which we anticipate will continue into and possibly beyond 
however  there can be no assurance that our selling  general and administrative expenses will not increase in the future due to additional litigation or other factors 
stock based compensation expense we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january  sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in operating results 
we recognized the stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees  which generally equals the vesting period of the stock based award

deferred compensation represents the difference between the grant price and the fair market value for financial statement reporting purposes of our common stock option and restricted stock grants 
as required by apb  we have recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation expense related to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
amortization of deferred compensation using the straight line vesting method was  in compared to  and  in and  respectively

income tax expense differs from the expected benefit that was derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to losses that are not currently benefited 
due to our loss position  a full valuation allowance has been established against our deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  as of that date

liquidity and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on many factors that affect our research and development  and sales and marketing activities 
as our quarterly net revenues for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of were and are expected to be substantially lower than revenues for the prior quarters of  we anticipate that our cash used in operations will increase significantly 
we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for however  these cash flow and operating results expectations are subject to numerous assumptions  many of which may not actually occur 
if some or all of such assumptions do not occur  our results may be substantially lower or different than expected  and our cash resources could be reduced faster than currently anticipated 
such assumptions include  without limitation  assumptions that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance  that our existing and potential customer base will continue to grow and that our industry s competitive landscape will not change adversely 
for more information about the risks relating to our business  please read carefully the section entitled risk factors set forth above 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales and marketing  and to fund general corporate activities 
we are also devoting significant capital resources to defending litigation  and expect to continue to incur substantial litigation expenses for the foreseeable future 
depending on the amount and timing of the resolutions of our existing cases and any future legal proceedings against us  our cash flows could be materially adversely affected in one or more future periods  and our financial condition could be severely impaired 
if our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
the sale of equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  could require us to pledge our intellectual property or other assets to secure the financing  or could impose restrictive covenants on us 
these additional securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results  or to sell assets or otherwise restructure our business to remain viable 
since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through operating activities and the sale of equity securities 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  operating activities during used million primarily due to our net loss of million adjusted for non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation expense and million for depreciation and amortization coupled with cash used of million for net changes in assets and liabilities 
the net changes in assets and liabilities were primarily due to increases in inventories of million and other current assets of million and a decrease in other long term liabilities of million and million in accrued compensation and related expenses partially offset by increases of million in accrued liabilities and other  million in accounts payable and decreases of million in accounts receivable and million in other assets 
the increase in inventories was primarily attributable to a substantial decline in actual revenues from forecasted revenues when purchase commitments were made 
the increase in other current assets was due to the purchase of software design tools and technology licenses 
the decrease in other long term liabilities was primarily attributable to amortization of the surplus facility reserve 
the decrease in accrued compensation was due to timing of payroll related accruals 
the accrued liabilities and other increase was primarily due to the accrual for engineering design tools  an accrual for noncancellable purchase orders for wafers and increased royalty accruals 
the accounts payable increase was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts during the fourth quarter 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from lower shipments in as compared to the decrease in other assets was primarily due to timing of an asset changing its classification to other current assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities related to purchases of available for sale securities of million and the purchase of million of property and equipment partially offset by sales and maturities of available for sale securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and stock option exercises 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  the rate at which we will consume cash will depend on various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the levels of demand for our products  litigation outcomes and the other risks listed in the risk factors section of this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while concurrently maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the current value of the principal amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities  with maturities of less than eighteen months 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds  high quality commercial paper  and government and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
