business segments and other operations individual markets the individual markets business provides its products through two segments individual annuities and individual life insurance 
the individual annuities segment provides tax deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities  including indexed annuities  and variable annuities 
the individual annuities segment also offers broker dealer services through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the individual life insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through both single and survivorship versions of universal life  variable universal life  and term insurance  as well as a linked benefit product  which is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide for long term care costs 
individual annuities the individual annuities segment  with principal operations in fort wayne  indiana  and hartford  connecticut  and additional operations in greensboro  north carolina and concord  new hampshire  provides tax deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable annuities 
as a result of a broad product portfolio and a strong and diverse distribution network  we ranked th in assets and th in individual contract variable annuity sales for the year ended december  in the united states  according to variable annuity research and data services vards 
the individual annuities segment offers non qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to individuals 
the fixed and variable classification describes whether we or the policyholders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract 
this also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products  either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset based fees charged to variable products 
annuities are attractive because they provide tax deferred growth in the underlying principal  thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values  often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement 
in addition to favorable tax treatment  annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for life 
the individual annuities market has seen an increase in competition along with new product types and promotion 
the guarantee features living  income and death benefits offered within an annuity are not found in any other investment vehicle  and  we believe  make annuities attractive even in times of economic uncertainty 
products in general  an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company  after receipt of one or more contributions  agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis ie  annually  semi annually  quarterly  or monthly  beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract 
such payments can begin within twelve months after the contribution is received referred to as an immediate annuity or at a future date in time referred to as a deferred annuity 
this retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable annuity 

table of contents the individual annuities segment s deposits for the periods indicated were as follows year ended december in millions individual annuities variable portion of variable annuity deposits fixed portion of variable annuity deposits total variable annuity deposits indexed annuity deposits fixed annuity deposits total annuity deposits variable annuities a variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of deposits into one or more sub accounts offered through the product variable portion or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return fixed portion 
the value of the variable portion of the contract holder s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub accounts chosen by the contract holder 
the underlying assets of the sub accounts are managed within a special insurance series of funds  similar to mutual funds 
the contract holder s return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the variable annuity  ie the contract holder bears the investment risk associated with these investments  except for the impact of guaranteed benefit features 
the value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general account liabilities 
account values of variable annuities for individual business were billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  including the fixed portions of variable accounts of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we charge mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative charges 
these assessments are built into accumulation unit values  which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any sub account equals the contract holder s account value for that sub account 
the fees that we earn from these policies are reported as insurance fees on the income statement 
in addition  for some contracts  we collect surrender charges that range from to of withdrawals generally higher during the early years of a contract when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period 
our individual variable annuity products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years 
we offer a share  b share  c share  l share  and bonus variable annuities  although not with every annuity product 
the differences in a  b  c  l  and bonus shares relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract 
an a share has a front end sales charge and no back end contingent deferred sales charge  also known as a surrender charge 
the net premium premium less front end charge is invested in the contract  resulting in full liquidity and lower mortality and expense assessments over the long term than those in other share classes 
a b share has a seven year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract s specified surrender charge period 
the entire premium is invested in the contract  but it offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge period 
a c share has no front end sales charge or back end surrender charge 
accordingly  it offers maximum liquidity but mortality and expense assessments are higher than those for a or b shares 
it offers a persistency credit in year eight to revert pricing to b share levels 
an l share has a four to five year contingent deferred sales charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract s specified surrender charge period 
the differences between the l share and the b share are the length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure 
l shares have a shorter surrender charge period  so for the added liquidity  mortality and expense assessments are higher 
we offer l share annuity products with persistency credits beginning in years five or eight to revert pricing back to b share levels 
a bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified percentage typically ranging from to of each deposit 
the entire premium plus the bonus are invested in the sub accounts supporting the contract 
it has a seven to nine year contingent deferred sales charge 
the expenses are slightly more than those for a b share 
we also offer bonus annuity products with persistency credits beginning in years eight or fifteen to revert bonus pricing back to b share pricing levels 

table of contents certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefit features  such as a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb  a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb  a guaranteed income benefit gib and a combination of such benefits 
most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account value 
approximately  and of variable annuity separate account values had a gmdb feature at december   and  respectively 
the gmdb features include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death  we will return no less than a the total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals  b the total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return  or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
the lincoln smart security sm advantage benefit is a gmwb feature that offers the contract holder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit or contract value  if elected after issue  adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals 
there are two elective step up options a one year option and a five year option 
in general  the one year option allows an owner to step up the guarantee automatically on the benefit anniversary  and the five year option allows the owner to step up the guarantee amount on or after the fifth anniversary of the election or of the most recent step up 
in each case  the contract value must be greater than the initial deposit at the time of step up 
to receive the full amount of the guarantee  annual withdrawals are limited to either of the guaranteed amount for the one year option or of the guaranteed amount for the five year option 
withdrawals in excess of the applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges  and the guaranteed amount is recalculated 
approximately  and of variable annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively  had elected a gmwb feature 
we offer other product riders including ilife advantage and later sm advantage 
the ilife feature  on which we have received a us patent  allows variable annuity contract holders access and control during the income distribution phase of their contract 
this added flexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for transfers  additional withdrawals  and other service features like portfolio rebalancing 
in general  gib is an optional feature available with ilife advantage that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below of the highest income payment on a specified anniversary date reduced for any subsequent withdrawals 
approximately  and of ilife advantage account values elected the gib feature in  and  respectively 
approximately  and of variable annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively  have elected an ilife feature 
later sm advantage provides a minimum income base used to determine the gib floor when a client begins income payments under ilife advantage 
the income base is equal to the initial deposit or contract value  if elected after issue and increases by every three years subject to a cap 
the owner may step up the income base on or after the third anniversary of rider election or of the most recent step up which also resets the cap 
to mitigate the increased risks associated with guaranteed benefits  we developed a dynamic hedging program 
the customized dynamic hedging program uses equity and interest rate futures positions as well as equity based options depending upon the risks underlying the guarantees 
our program is designed to offset both positive and negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees 
however  while we actively manage these hedge positions  the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to  among other things  the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions  extreme swings in the equity markets  contract holder behavior  and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices 
for more information on our hedging program  see critical accounting policies insurance and investment contract obligations of the md a 
for information regarding risks related to guaranteed benefits  see item a risk factors below 
fixed annuities a fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value 
we offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities market 
single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single contribution to be made 
flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple contributions on either a scheduled or non scheduled basis 
our fixed annuities include both traditional fixed rate and fixed indexed annuities 
with fixed deferred annuities  the contract holder has the right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and  if applicable  a market value adjustment mva 
fixed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to elect an interest rate linked to the performance of the s p index 
the indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than zero 
our fixed indexed annuities provide contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed rate account and one or more different indexed accounts 
a contract holder may elect to change their 
table of contents allocations at renewal dates  either annually or biannually 
at each renewal date  we have the opportunity to re price the indexed component ie reset the caps  spreads  or participation rates  subject to minimum guarantees 
fixed annuity contracts are general account obligations 
we bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts 
to protect from premature withdrawals  we impose surrender charges 
surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract  with a declining level of surrender charges over time 
we expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders accounts 
in addition  with respect to fixed indexed annuities  we purchase options that are highly correlated to the indexed account allocation decisions of our contract holders  such that we are closely hedged with respect to indexed interest for the current reset period 
for more information on our hedging program for fixed indexed annuities  see critical accounting policies of the md a 
individual fixed annuity account values were billion  billion and billion at december   and approximately billion  billion and billion of individual fixed annuity account values at december   and  respectively  were still within the surrender charge period 
however  certain fixed annuities allow window periods during which contract holders can withdraw their funds without incurring a surrender charge 
for example  our step five fixed annuity has a sixty day window period following each five year fixed guarantee period 
crediting rates for each subsequent five year fixed guarantee period are set at the beginning of the window period 
during the window period  account holders can withdraw their funds without incurring a surrender charge 
account values for this type of product were billion  billion and billion at december   and  with approximately billion of account values entering the window period during our fixed annuity product offerings as of december  consist of traditional fixed rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities 
we also offer fixed rate immediate annuities with various payment options  including lifetime incomes 
the traditional fixed rate deferred annuity products include the lincoln select and choiceplus fixed and the jefferson pilot classic single and flexible premium annuities 
the fixed indexed deferred annuity products include the jefferson pilot optipoint  optichoice  new directions and futurepoint annuities 
the fixed indexed annuities offer one or more of the following indexed accounts the performance triggered indexed account pays a specified rate  declared at the beginning of the indexed term  if the s p value at the end of the indexed term is the same or greater than the s p value at the beginning of the indexed term 
the point to point indexed account compares the value of the s p at the end of the indexed term to the s p value at the beginning of the term 
if the s p at the end of the indexed term is higher than the s p value at the beginning of the term  then the percentage change  up to the declared indexed interest cap  is credited to the indexed account 
the monthly cap indexed account reflects the monthly changes in the s p value over the course of the indexed term 
each month  the percentage change in the s p value is calculated  subject to a monthly indexed cap that is declared at the beginning of the indexed term 
at the end of the indexed term  all of the monthly change percentages are summed to determine the rate of indexed interest that will be credited to the account 
the monthly average indexed account compares the average monthly value of the s p to the s p value at the beginning of the term 
the average of the s p values at the end of each of the twelve months in the indexed term is calculated 
the percentage change of the average s p value to the starting s p value is calculated 
from that amount  the indexed interest spread  which is declared at the beginning of the indexed term  is subtracted 
the resulting rate is used to calculate the indexed interest that will be credited to the account 
if the s p values produce a negative indexed interest rate  no indexed interest is credited to the indexed account 
many of our fixed annuities have a market value adjustment mva 
if a contract with an mva is surrendered during the surrender charge period  both a surrender charge and an mva may be applied 
the mva feature increases or decreases the contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates 
individual fixed annuities with an mva feature constituted  and of total fixed annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively 
distribution the individual annuities segment distributes all its individual fixed and variable annuity products through lfd  our wholesaling distribution organization 
lfd s distribution channels give the individual annuities segment access to its target 
table of contents markets 
lfd distributes the segment s products to a large number of financial intermediaries  including lfn 
the financial intermediaries include wire regional firms  independent financial planners  financial institutions and managing general agents 
competition the annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies  with no one company dominating the market for all products 
the individual annuities segment competes with numerous other financial services companies 
the main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers  investment performance  cost  product features  speed to market  brand recognition  financial strength ratings  crediting rates  and client service 
we believe that the individual annuities segment s high service levels help it to compete in the annuities market 
it tracks the amount of time in which calls to the center are answered as well as the average response time to customer queries 
further  the segment tracks the turnaround time for various customer services such as processing of applications 
the individual annuities segment attempts to design products that meet the needs of clients in its markets 
the speed in which the segment s products reach the market is  from concept of the product to launch  six to nine months 
over the last five years  the segment has announced several new products and product features to market in response to the evolving nature of the annuities market 
individual life insurance the individual life insurance segment  with principal operations in greensboro  north carolina  and hartford  connecticut  with additional operations in concord  new hampshire and fort wayne  indiana  focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance products 
the individual life insurance segment primarily offers both single and survivorship versions of universal life ul  variable universal life vul  and term insurance 
the segment also offers a linked benefit product  moneyguard  which is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide reimbursement for long term care costs 
the life insurance operation primarily targets the mass affluent to high net worth markets  defined as households with at least  of net worth or more 
for those individual policies we sold in  the average face amount excluding term and moneyguard was  and average first year premiums paid were approximately products the individual life insurance segment sells primarily interest market sensitive products ul and vul and term products 
the segment s sales as defined below for the prior three years were as follows year ended december in millions universal life excluding moneyguard moneyguard total universal life variable universal life whole life term total ul  vul  and moneyguard sales represent target premium plus of excess premium including adjustments for internal replacements at  whole life and term sales throughout the presentation represent of first year paid premium 
due to some seasonality  we generally have higher sales in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year 
approximately  and of total sales were in the first half of  and  with the remainder occurring in the second half of the year for the same periods 

table of contents in addition  the following table shows life policies face amount in force 
face amount in force at december in millions in force face amount universal life and other term insurance total in force mortality margins  morbidity margins for moneyguard  investment margins through spreads or fees  net expense charges expense charges assessed to the policyholder less expenses incurred to manage the business and surrender fees drive life insurance profits 
mortality margins represent the difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the mortality risk and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid 
mortality charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder s policy account value ie cost of insurance assessments or coi s or are embedded in the premiums charged to the customer 
in either case  these amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in force less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits 
insurance in force  in turn  is driven by sales  persistency  and mortality experience 
similar to the annuity product classifications described above  life products can be classified as fixed or variable contracts 
this classification describes whether we or the policyholders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy 
this also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products  either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset based fees charged to variable products 
we offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of fixed life insurance primarily ul fixed life insurance products provide life insurance with account cash values that earn rates of return based on company declared interest rates 
policyholder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio  so we bear the risk of investment performance 
some of our ul contracts include secondary guarantees  which are explained more fully later in the document 
in a ul contract  policyholders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit  provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming period 
under certain policyholder options and market conditions  the death benefit amount may increase or decrease 
premiums received on a ul product  net of expense loads and charges  are added to the policyholder s account value 
the client has access to their account value or a portion thereof through contractual liquidity features such as loans  partial withdrawals  and full surrenders 
loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount and are limited to certain contractual maximums some of which are required under state law  and interest is charged on all loans 
our ul contracts assess surrender charges against the policies account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur during the contractual surrender charge period 
depending on the product selected  surrender charge periods can range from to years 
we manage investment margins ie the difference between the rate the portfolio earns compared to the rate that is credited to the customer by seeking to maximize current yields  in line with asset liability and risk management targets  while crediting a competitive rate to the customer 
crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract 
fixed life account values excluding vul were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
linked benefit life products linked benefit products combine fixed life insurance with long term care insurance through the use of riders 
the first rider allows the policyholder to accelerate their death benefit on a tax free basis in the event of a qualified long term care need 
the second rider extends the long term care insurance benefits for an additional period of time if the death benefit is fully depleted for the purposes of long term care 
if the long term care benefits are never used  the policy provides a tax free death benefit to the policyholder s heirs 
linked benefit products generate earnings through investment  mortality  and morbidity margins 
our linked benefit product is called moneyguard 
variable universal life insurance vul vul products are ul products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of sub accounts offered through the product 
the value of the policyholder s account varies with the performance of the sub accounts chosen by the policyholder 
the underlying assets of the sub accounts are managed within a special insurance series of funds 
premiums  net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses  received on vul products are invested according to the policyholder s investment option selection 
as the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases  the account value of the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease 
as with fixed ul products  
table of contents policyholders have access  within contractual maximums  to account values through loans  withdrawals  and surrenders 
surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period  ranging from to years depending on the product 
the investment choices we offer in vul products are the same  in most cases  as the investment choices offered in our individual variable annuity contracts 
in addition  vul products offer a fixed account option that is managed by us 
investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option 
we charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses as well as asset based investment management fees 
vul account values were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
term life insurance term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time 
it usually does not offer cash values 
scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually 
products offering a return of premium benefit payable at the end of a specified period have been offered since march as mentioned previously  we offer survivorship versions of our individual ul and vul products 
these products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death 
sales results continue to be heavily influenced by the series of universal life products with secondary guarantees 
a ul policy with a secondary guarantee can stay in force  even if the base policy account value is zero  as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met 
the secondary guarantee requirement is based on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy  calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value  but using different assumptions as to expense charges  coi charges  and credited interest 
the assumptions for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the contract 
as long as the policyholder funds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated reference value positive  the death benefit will be guaranteed 
the reference value has no actual monetary value to the policyholder  it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero 
unlike other guaranteed death benefit designs  our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of a traditional ul policy  which allows a policyholder to take loans or withdrawals 
although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the guaranteed death benefit  the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited  as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs 
the length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits 
during  we continued to monitor the regulatory changes that impact reserving for these products as well as the competitive environment 
secondary guarantee ul face amount in force was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
during we expanded and enhanced our variable products by introducing a survivorship version of vul one and enhancing our single life vul one 
these products combine the lapse protection elements of universal life with the upside potential of a traditional variable universal life product 
vul one gives clients the flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection and market risk that meets their individual needs 
the combined single life and survivorship vul one face amount in force was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
distribution the individual life insurance segment s products are sold through lfd 
lfd provides the life insurance segment with access to financial intermediaries in the following primary distribution channels wire regional firms  independent planner firms including lfn  financial institutions  and managing general agents

further  the individual life insurance segment tracks the turnaround time and quality for various client services such as processing of applications 
underwriting in the context of life insurance  underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality 
this process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification 
of course  no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live  but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process 
claims administration claims services are delivered to customers from the greensboro and concord home offices 
claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage amount  type of claim  and the experience of the examiner 
claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claim examiners 
a formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities 
a network of in house legal counsel  compliance officers  medical personnel  and an anti fraud investigative unit also support claim examiners 
a special team of claims examiners  in conjunction with claims management  focus on more complex claims matters such as moneyguard long term care claims  claims incurred during the contestable period  beneficiary disputes  litigated claims  and the few invalid claims that are encountered 
the individual life insurance segment maintains a centralized claim service center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on its claims examiners while providing convenient service to policy owners and beneficiaries

lincoln financial media the lincoln financial media segment consists of radio and television broadcasting stations located in selected markets in the southeastern and western united states and also produces and distributes syndicated collegiate basketball and football sports programming 
products the primary source of revenue for our media properties is the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers 
our net revenues for lincoln financial media s television  radio and sports operations for the period from april  to december  were as follows in millions radio television sports total seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by retailers and automobile manufacturers 
broadcast advertising is typically strongest in the second and fourth quarters of the year  which coincides with increased advertising around certain holidays 
historically  the second quarter tends to show an increase in automotive advertising as well as increases in tourism and travel advertising before the summer months 
because television and radio broadcasters rely upon advertising revenue  they are subject to cyclical changes in the economy  such as benefiting from political campaign advertising revenues in even numbered years 
the size of advertisers budgets  which are affected by broad economic trends  affects the broadcast industry in general and the revenue of individual television and radio stations 
the stations and sports programming derived of their advertising revenues from the automotive industry for the period april  through december  if automobile advertising is severely curtailed  it could have a negative impact on broadcasting revenues 
lincoln financial sports generates most of its revenues during fourth quarter for football and first quarter for basketball 
television operations wbtv  channel  charlotte  nc  is affiliated with cbs under a network affiliation agreement expiring on may  wwbt  channel  richmond  va  is affiliated with nbc under a network affiliation agreement expiring december  wcsc  channel  charleston  sc  is affiliated with cbs under a network affiliation agreement expiring on may  absent cancellation by either party  each of these agreements is expected to be renewed for successive five year periods 
for  of television revenues came from a network agreement with the two cbs affiliated stations that expires in the trend in 
table of contents the industry is away from the networks compensating affiliates for carrying their programming  and there is a possibility those revenues will be eliminated when the contract is renewed 
the primary source of revenue for our television stations is through the sale of time to local and national advertisers 
our television advertising revenues in even numbered years benefit from political  issue  and olympics related advertising 
in all our markets  we focus on developing leading news programming  which we believe is the optimal way to maximize revenues 
radio operations lincoln financial media owns and operates one am and one fm station in atlanta  ga  one am and two fm stations in charlotte  nc  two am and three fm stations in denver  co and one am and two fm stations in miami  fl 
in san diego  ca  lincoln financial media owns and operates four fm stations and owns one am station now operated by a third party under a local marketing agreement lma 
the third party operator of the san diego am station has declared its intention to exercise a purchase option on that station during most of our radio broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of local and national advertising 
additional revenue is generated from event payments  barter and other miscellaneous transactions 
our radio stations employ various formats for their programming 
a station s format can be important in determining the size and characteristics of its listening audience 
advertising rates charged by a radio station are based primarily on the station s ability to attract audiences having certain demographic characteristics in the market area that advertisers want to reach  as well as the number of stations and other advertising media competing in the market and the relative demand for radio in any given market 
advertising rates generally are the highest during morning and evening drive time hours 
depending on the format of a particular station  there are certain numbers of advertisements that are broadcast each hour 
we determine the number of advertisements broadcast hourly that can maximize available revenue dollars without jeopardizing listening levels 
sports operations lincoln financial sports principal business is to produce and syndicate broadcasts of atlantic coast conference and southeastern conference football and basketball events 
the contracts with the leagues were renewed in and extend through the seasons for the atlantic coast conference and the seasons for the southeastern conference

most of our sports broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time 
additional revenue is generated from renting the trucks that we use to produce sporting events to third parties for both sporting and other event production 
competition our radio and television stations compete for programming  talent and revenues with other radio and television stations as well as with other advertising and entertainment media  including direct distribution cable and satellite television and direct transmission and satellite radio 
lincoln financial sports competes with other vendors of similar products and services 
other operations other operations includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments  unallocated corporate items such as investment income on investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate investments  interest expense on short term and long term borrowings  and certain expenses  including restructuring and merger related expenses  along with the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the transaction with swiss re 
other operations also includes the eliminations of intercompany transactions and the inter segment elimination of the investment advisory fees for asset management services the investment management segment provides to individual markets and employer markets 

table of contents revenues from other operations were as follows in millions premiums net investment income amortization of deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance other revenue and fees inter segment elimination of investment advisory fees total reinsurance we follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity risks with unaffiliated reinsurers 
in a reinsurance transaction  a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium 
we use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss 
we also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing 
although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their policyholders for losses insured under the insurance policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
as a result of the jefferson pilot merger  we currently have two reinsurance programs one for lnl and its insurance subsidiaries  lincoln life annuity company of new york and first penn pacific life insurance company the lnl program  and one for the jefferson pilot insurance companies the jp program 
under the lnl program  we reinsure approximately to of the mortality risk on newly issued non term life insurance contracts and approximately to of total mortality risk including term insurance contracts 
our policy for this program is to retain no more than million on a single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance contracts 
additionally  the retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for coli is million and million  respectively 
beginning in september  we changed the lnl program for our primary term products from coinsurance to renewable term and from to on a first dollar quota share basis 
in january  we changed this program from first dollar quota share to an excess of retention program 
these changes have the effect of reducing premiums paid to reinsurers while increasing our exposure to mortality losses  and could result in more volatility in results for our individual markets life insurance segment 
with respect to annuities  we had previously reinsured a portion of our fixed annuity business  but beginning in  we have retained the full risk on newly issued contracts 
the insurance subsidiaries participating in the jp program are jefferson pilot financial insurance company jpfic  jefferson pilot lifeamerica insurance company jpla and jefferson pilot life insurance company jp life 
for the jp program  our policy is to reinsure risks in excess of retention  which ranges from less than million to million on a single insured life  depending on the retention limit set for various individual products 
we also attempt to reduce exposure to losses that may result from unfavorable events or circumstances by reinsuring certain levels and types of accident and health insurance risks underwritten 
with the integration of the lincoln and jefferson pilot companies and their products  we completed a corporate wide evaluation of retention levels for new products concerning any one individual life and in the aggregate 
this evaluation  to maximize profitability while minimizing mortality risk  will include the impact of changes in mortality retention balanced with the impact of premiums paid to reinsurers for new business written starting in portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks 
to cover products other than life insurance  we acquire other insurance coverages with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances 
in a coinsurance program  the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial terms of the reinsured policies  ie premiums  expenses  claims  etc 
based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in a renewable term program  the reinsurer is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality risk assumed by the reinsurer 
in a first dollar quota share program  the reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in an excess of retention program  the reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life retention

reserves the applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report  as liabilities  policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies 
these reserves are the amounts that  with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature 
these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables  interest rates  and methods of valuation 
the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance subsidiaries 
these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables  interest  persistency and other assumptions which are believed to be more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial reserving methods 
see regulatory below for information on proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities 
the assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable 
if actual experience is not less favorable than the reserve assumptions  then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses 
if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions  additional reserves may be required 
the key experience assumptions include mortality rates  policy persistency and interest rates 
we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred  as we believe appropriate 
for risks related to reserves  see risk factors below 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets 
our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management  with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations 
this approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized  while still meeting our income objectives 
this approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset liability management  since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities 
investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes and income generation 
hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including  but not limited to  hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our gmdb and gmwb liabilities  interest rate fluctuations  the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity us government obligations  and credit  foreign exchange and equity risks 
income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions rsats 
these derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt  similar to investing in the credit markets 
our investment portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers

regulatory general our insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are subject to regulation and supervision by the states  territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business 
the extent of such regulation varies  but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies 
in the united states  this power is vested in state insurance departments 
in supervising and regulating insurance companies  state insurance departments  charged primarily with protecting policyholders and the public rather than investors  enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose 
our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the following states insurance subsidiary state of domicile the lincoln national life insurance company lnl indiana jefferson pilot life insurance company jp life north carolina first penn pacific life insurance company first penn indiana jefferson pilot financial insurance company jpfic nebraska jefferson pilot lifeamerica insurance company jpla new jersey lincoln life annuity company of new york llany new york the insurance departments of those states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over them 
the extent of regulation by the states varies  but in general  most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency  adequacy of reserves  reinsurance  capital adequacy  licensing of companies and agents to transact business  prescribing and approving policy forms  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports  regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct 
insurance company regulation is discussed further below under insurance holding company regulation and restrictions on subsidiaries dividends and other payments 
a new statutory reserving standard commonly called vacarvm is being developed by the naic replacing current statutory reserve practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits such as gmwbs 
the timing for adoption of vacarvm is not certain but we currently expect adoption in in its current draft form  vacarvm has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us 
we plan to utilize existing captive reinsurance structures to lessen any negative impact on statutory capital and dividend capacity in the life insurance subsidiaries 
however  additional statutory reserves could lead to lower risk based capital ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries 
for more information of the impact of vacarvm  see review of financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  however  federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry

egtrra also includes provisions that will eliminate  over time  the estate  gift and generation skipping taxes and partially 
table of contents eliminates the step up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent s estate

these provisions expire after  unless extended 
in may  the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of jgtrra was enacted 
individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of jgtrra  which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted originally under egtrra  as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions 
on may   the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of tipra was signed into law 
tipra extends the lower capital gains and dividends rates through the end of although most of these rate reductions expire after  these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build up of value of annuities and life insurance products 
like the egtrra changes  the jgtrra changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products 
on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of ajca  which includes provisions affecting non qualified deferred compensation plans that may make such plans more complicated for employers depending on final tax rules and regulations 
because our coli products are often used to support such deferred compensation liabilities  the ajca may constrain sales of our coli products 
in february  bills were introduced in congress to provide tax incentives designed to encourage individuals to invest their after tax income in retirement vehicles  such as annuities  that provide guaranteed lifetime income 
under the proposal  individuals would not pay federal taxes on one half of the income generated by annuities that make lifetime payments up to an annual limit of  if this bill is enacted into law  we believe that it would have a favorable impact on our annuity business 
in february  the bush administration proposed that many of the temporary rate reductions from egtrra and the act be made permanent 
the administration also continues to propose tax favored savings initiatives that  if enacted by congress  could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity  life and tax qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products 
however  we expect that the income for life guarantee provided within an annuity and features like our gmwb will continue to be viewed as significant benefits and may offset the adverse effect of these proposals 
on august   the pension protection act of ppa was signed into law 
ppa makes numerous changes to pension and other tax laws including permanence for the egtrra enacted pension provisions including higher annual contribution limits for defined contribution plans and iras as well as catch up contributions for persons over age  clarification of the safest available annuity standard for the selection of an annuity as a distribution option for defined contribution plans  expansion of investment advice options for defined contribution plan participants and ira owners  more stringent funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans and clarification of the legal status of hybrid cash balance pension plans  and non pension related tax changes such as the codification of coli best practices bringing more certainty to this market segment  permanence for egtrra enacted tax benefits for section college savings plans  and favorable tax treatment for long term care insurance included as a rider to or on annuity products 
we expect many of these changes to have a beneficial effect upon various segments of our business lines 
some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor  in addition to being registered under the securities act of  are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of  and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the district of columbia 
we also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker dealers under the securities exchange act of exchange act and are subject to federal and state regulation  including but not limited to the nasd s net capital rules 
in addition  we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the investment advisers act of lfn s agents and our employees  insofar as they are involved in the sale or marketing of products that are securities  are subject to the exchange act and to examination requirements and regulation by the sec  the nasd and state securities commissioners 
regulation also extends to various lnc entities that employ or control those individuals 
the sec and other governmental agencies and self regulatory organizations  as well as state securities commissions in the united states  have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders or suspension  termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees 
federal and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual fund  indexed annuity and variable annuity businesses 
as a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses  there have been numerous regulatory reform  initiatives addressing issues which include  but are not limited to  mutual fund governance and compliance practices  late trading  suitability of indexed and variable annuity products  directed brokerage and soft dollars  and new disclosure requirements concerning commission breakpoints  revenue sharing  shelf space  advisory fees  market timing  portfolio pricing  information about portfolio managers and other issues 
while we have made certain changes to our businesses in response to new regulations  they have not had a significant impact on our businesses 
however  it is difficult to predict whether additional changes resulting from new regulations will materially affect our businesses  and  if so  to what degree 

table of contents television and radio broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission fcc under the communications act of  as amended the act 
the act empowers the fcc to issue  renew  revoke or modify broadcasting licenses  assign frequencies  determine the locations of stations  regulate the equipment used by stations  establish areas to be served  adopt necessary regulations  and impose certain penalties for violation of the regulations 
the act and present regulations prohibit the transfer of a license or of control of a licensee without prior approval of the fcc  restrict in various ways the common and multiple ownership of broadcast facilities  restrict alien ownership of licenses  and impose various other strictures on ownership and operation 
broadcasting licenses are granted for a period of eight years for both television and radio and  in the absence of adverse claims as to the licensee s qualifications or performance  will normally be renewed by the fcc for an additional term 
insurance holding company regulation lnc and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of indiana  nebraska  north carolina  new jersey and new york 
these insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company s system to register with the insurance department authorities  to file with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital structure  ownership  management  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions  including material transfers of assets and intercompany business agreements  and to report material changes in that information 
these laws also require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and  under certain circumstances  prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an intercompany transaction 
further  these laws require that an insurer s policyholders surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs 
in general  under state holding company regulations  no person may acquire  directly or indirectly  a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person  corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control 
pursuant to such laws  in general  any person acquiring  controlling or holding the power to vote  directly or indirectly  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company  is presumed to have control of such company 
this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact 
the insurance commissioner  however  may find that control exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities 
to obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company  the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the nature  source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition  the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates  any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer  the number and type of securities to be acquired  any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired  any agreements with broker dealers  and other matters 
other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions 
additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control 
as further described below  laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries 
restrictions on subsidiaries dividends and other payments we are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company 
under indiana laws and regulations  our indiana insurance subsidiaries  including our primary insurance subsidiary  lnl  may pay dividends to lnc only from unassigned surplus  without prior approval of the indiana insurance commissioner the commissioner  or must receive prior approval of the commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend  along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months  would exceed the statutory limitation 
the current statutory limitation is the greater of i of the insurer s policyholders surplus  as shown on its last annual statement on file with the commissioner or ii the insurer s statutory net gain from operations for the previous twelve months  but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus 
indiana law gives commissioner broad discretion to disapprove 
table of contents requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
the states of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiaries  jp life  jpfic and jpla  have similar  but not identical  restrictions 
indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend  the insurer s policyholders surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs  and permits the indiana insurance commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards 
in the event that the indiana insurance commissioner determines that the policyholders surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate  the commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary 
for information regarding dividends paid to us during from our insurance subsidiaries  see review of consolidated financial condition sources of liquidity and cash flow in our md a 
as stated above  lnl is also an accredited reinsurer in the state of new york 
as a result  it is also subject to the certain regulatory requirements of the state of new york 
these regulations include reserve requirements  which differ from indiana s requirements 
the new york regulations require lnl to report more reserves to the state of new york 
as a result  the level of statutory surplus that lnl reports to new york is less than the statutory surplus reported to indiana and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
if new york requires us to maintain a higher level of capital to remain an accredited reinsurer in new york  lnl s ability to pay dividends to lnc could be constrained 
however  we do not expect the new york reserve requirements to constrain lnl s ability to pay dividends during for further information on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  see review of consolidated financial condition sources of liquidity and cash flow in the md a 
lincoln uk s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the uk financial services authority fsa and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the uk capital resources requirement 
lincoln uk targets maintaining approximately to times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory resource requirement 
effective january   all insurance companies operating in the uk also have to complete a risk based capital rbc assessment to demonstrate to the fsa that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks 
rbc requirements in the uk are different than the naic requirements 
in addition  the fsa imposes certain minimum capital requirements for the combined uk subsidiaries 
as is the case with regulated insurance companies in the us  future changes to regulatory capital requirements could impact the dividend capacity of our uk insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company 
risk based capital the naic has adopted risk based capital requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks 
the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile 
there are five major risks involved in determining the requirements 
category name description asset risk affiliates c risk of assets default for certain affiliated investments asset risk other c risk of assets default of principal and interest or fluctuation in fai r value insurance risk c risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the future interest rate risk  health credit risk and market risk c risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels  risk that health benefits prepaid to providers become the obligation of the health insurer once again and risk of loss due to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guarantees business risk c risk of general business a company s risk based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset  premium  claim  expense and reserve items 
regulators can then measure adequacy of a company s statutory surplus by comparing it to the risk based capital determined by the formula 
under rbc requirements  regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its company action level of rbc known as the rbc ratio  also as defined by the naic 

table of contents four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the rbc ratio is insufficient company action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake 
regulatory action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan  but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period 
authorized control level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the regulatory response is the same as at the regulatory action level  but in addition  the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
mandatory control level if the rbc ratio is less than  then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc ratios of lnl  jp life  jpfic  jpla  first penn and llany reported to their respective states of domicile and the naic all exceeded the company action level 
we believe that we will be able to maintain the rbc ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of company action level through prudent underwriting  claims handling  investing and capital management 
however  no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries  many of which could be outside of our control  including but not limited to changes in the regulatory environment  including changes to the manner in which the rbc ratio is calculated  economic conditions and competitive conditions in the jurisdictions in which we write business  will not cause the rbc ratios to fall below required levels resulting in a corresponding regulatory response 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
in that case  the value of our securities could decline substantially 
risk factors in connection with our business our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate 
our reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate 
we establish and carry  as a liability  reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims 
for our life insurance and annuity products  we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates  including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy  the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy  the lapse rate of the policies  the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive 
the assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  
table of contents we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay  or the timing of payment of  actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims 
if our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates  our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims 
as a result  we would incur a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves 
because the equity markets and other factors impact the profitability and expected profitability of many of our products  changes in equity markets and other factors may significantly affect our business and profitability 
the fee revenue that we earn on equity based variable annuities  unit linked accounts  variable universal life insurance policies and investment advisory business  is based upon account values 
because strong equity markets result in higher account values  strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee revenue 
conversely  a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources 
the increased fee revenue resulting from strong equity markets increases the expected gross profits egps from variable insurance products as do better than expected lapses  mortality rates and expenses 
as a result  the higher egps may result in lower net amortized costs related to deferred acquisition costs dac  deferred sales inducements dsi  value of business acquired voba  and deferred front end sales loads dfel 
however  a decrease in the equity market as well as increases in lapses  mortality rates and expenses depending upon their significance  may result in higher net amortized costs associated with dac  dsi  voba and dfel and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources 
for more information on dac  dsi  voba and dfel amortization  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies below 
changes in the equity markets  interest rates and or volatility affects the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits  therefore  such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
the amount of reserves related to the guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb for variable annuities is tied to the difference between the value of the underlying accounts and the guaranteed death benefit  calculated using a benefit ratio approach 
the gmdb reserves take into account the present value of total expected gmdb payments and the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract and claims and assessments to date 
the amount of reserves related to the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed income benefits gib for variable annuities is based on the fair value of the underlying benefit 
both the level of expected gmdb payments and expected total assessments used in calculating the benefit ratio are affected by the equity markets 
the liabilities related to gmwb and gib benefits valued at fair value are impacted by changes in equity markets  interest rates and volatility 
accordingly  strong equity markets will decrease the amount of gmdb reserves that we must carry  and strong equity markets  increases in interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the fair value of the liabilities underlying the gmwb and gib benefits 
conversely  a decrease in the equity markets will increase the net amount at risk under the gmdb benefits we offer as part of our variable annuity products  which has the effect of increasing the amount of gmdb reserves that we must carry 
also  a decrease in the equity market along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value of the liabilities underlying gmwb and gib benefits  which has the effect of increasing the amount of gmwb and gib reserves that we must carry 
such an increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves 
we maintain a customized dynamic hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits 
however  the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to  among other things  the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions  extreme swings or liquidity in the equity and derivatives markets  contractholder behavior different than expected  and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices 
for more information on our hedging program  see critical accounting policies insurance and investment contract obligations in the md a 
changes in interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in increased contract withdrawals 
because the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest sensitive whole life  universal life and fixed portion of variable universal life insurance business depends in part on interest rate spreads  interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability 
changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital 
some of our products  principally fixed annuities and interest sensitive whole life  universal life and the fixed portion of variable universal life insurance  have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread  or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to 
table of contents earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts 
declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations 
in periods of increasing interest rates  we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest sensitive products competitive 
we therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets 
in periods of declining interest rates  we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then available 
moreover  borrowers may prepay fixed income securities  commercial mortgages and mortgage backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbates this risk 
because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited  pre established intervals  and since many of our policies have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates  our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative 
increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products 
in periods of increasing interest rates  policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns 
this process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses 
these outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
a sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds 
a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products  increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and or hurt our relationships with creditors 
nationally recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and rate our debt 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically  and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future 
please see item business ratings above for a complete description of our ratings 
our financial strength ratings  which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations  are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and  as a result  our competitiveness 
the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings 
a downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings 
this could lead to a decrease in fees as outflows of assets increase  and therefore  result in lower fee income 
furthermore  sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses  depending on market conditions 
a downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt  and accordingly  likely increase our cost of capital 
in addition  a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations  to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above 
a drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage as well as a loss of key portfolio managers could result in lower advisory fees 
while mutual funds are not rated  per se  many industry periodicals and services  such as lipper  provide rankings of mutual fund performance 
these rankings often have an impact on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in 
if the rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease materially  the funds assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with higher performance rankings 
similarly  a loss of our key portfolio managers who manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance  as well as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the portfolio managers 
any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees that we earn from such mutual funds  which are generally tied to the amount of fund assets and performance 
this would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business 
the supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance policyholders  and not our investors 
the extent of regulation varies  but generally is governed by state statutes 
these statutes delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 
this system of supervision and regulation covers  among other things standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay  the existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  and assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations  which may change from time to time 
also  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 
further  insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision  which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company 
as of december   no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  lfn and lfd  as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products  are subject to regulation and supervision by the sec and the national association of securities dealers nasd 
our investment management segment  like other investment management companies  is subject to regulation and supervision by the sec  nasd  the municipal securities rulemaking board  the pennsylvania department of banking and jurisdictions of the states  territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business 
lincoln uk is subject to regulation by the financial services authority in the uk these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self regulatory organizations broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations 
finally  our television and radio operations require a license  subject to periodic renewal  from the fcc to operate 
while management considers the likelihood of a failure to renew remote  any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations 
many of the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees 
in recent years  there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies  which has included more extensive examinations  regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents 
these regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if  in their view  our practices  or those of our agents or employees  are improper 
these actions can result in substantial fines  penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for further information on regulatory matters relating to us  see item business regulatory above 
legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses 
there continues to be a significant amount of federal and state regulatory activity in the industry relating to numerous issues including  but not limited to  market timing and late trading of mutual fund and variable and indexed insurance products and broker dealer access arrangements 
like others in the industry  we have received inquiries including requests for information 
table of contents and or subpoenas from various authorities including the sec  nasd and the new york attorney general  as well as notices of potential proceedings from the sec and nasd 
we are in the process of responding to  and in some cases have settled or are in the process of settling  certain of these inquiries and potential proceedings 
we continue to cooperate fully with such authorities 
in addition  we are  and in the future may be  subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and investment management operations  both domestically and internationally 
pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate 
some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants 
in certain of these matters  the plaintiffs are seeking large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive or exemplary damages 
substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation  which in turn could materially harm our business prospects 
changes in us federal income tax law could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs 
the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of egtrra as well as the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of contain provisions that have and will continue  near term  to significantly lower individual tax rates 
these may have the effect of reducing the benefits of deferral on the build up of value of annuities and life insurance products 
egtrra also includes provisions that will eliminate  over time  the estate  gift and generation skipping taxes and partially eliminate the step up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent s estate 
many of these provisions expire in  unless extended 
the bush administration continues to propose that many of the foregoing rate reductions  as well as elimination of the estate tax  be made permanent  and continues to propose several tax favored savings initiatives  that  if enacted by congress  could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity  life and tax qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products 
although we cannot predict the overall effect on the sales of our products of the tax law changes included in these acts  some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance products 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures to identify  monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective 
many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate  such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths 
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients  catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us  which may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
management of operational  legal and regulatory risks requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events  and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
because we are a holding company with no direct operations  the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations 
we are a holding company  and we have no direct operations 
our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance  investment management and communication company subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
changes in these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses 
we face a risk of non collectibility of reinsurance  which could materially affect our results of operations 
we follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries known as ceding 
at the end of  we have ceded approximately billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection 
although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay policyholders for losses insured under the policies we issue  reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
as of december   we had billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses  for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our 
table of contents reinsurance contracts 
of this amount  billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance business to swiss re in through an indemnity reinsurance agreement 
during  swiss re funded a trust to support this business 
the balance in the trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was billion at december  in addition  should swiss re s financial strength ratings drop below either s p aa or am best a or their naic risk based capital ratio fall below  assets equal to the reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according to pre established asset quality guidelines 
furthermore  approximately billion of the swiss re treaties are funds withheld structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables 
during the third quarter one of lnl s reinsurers  scottish re group ltd scottish re  received rating downgrades from various rating agencies 
of the billion of fixed annuity business that lnl reinsures with scottish re  approximately is reinsured through the use of modified coinsurance treaties  in which lnl possesses the investments that support the reserves ceded to scottish re 
for its annuity business ceded on a coinsurance basis  scottish re had previously established an irrevocable investment trust for the benefit of lnl that supports the reserves 
in addition to fixed annuities  lnl has approximately million of policy liabilities on the life insurance business it reinsures with scottish re 
scottish re continues to perform under its contractual responsibilities to lnl 
the balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers 
the collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers 
we perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial capacity  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
we also require assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions 
despite these measures  a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract  especially swiss re  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
significant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of  or higher prices for  reinsurance 
we reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten newly issued  individual life insurance contracts 
we regularly review retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future 
if we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity experience  a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers 
prolonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs  and ultimately  reinsurers not willing to offer coverage 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient  we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums 
if this were to occur  we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates 
catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and the availability of reinsurance 
our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality  such as a pandemic  an act of terrorism or other event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries 
significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century  but the likelihood  timing  or the severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted 
in our group insurance operations  a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims 
these events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and  depending on their severity  could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
pandemics  hurricanes  earthquakes and man made  including terrorism  catastrophes may produce significant damage in larger areas  especially those that are heavily populated 
claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
also  catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries 
accordingly  our ability to write new business could also be affected 
consistent with industry practice and accounting standards  we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event 
we cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities  and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees  particularly financial advisors 
we compete to attract and retain financial advisors  wholesalers  portfolio managers and other employees  as well as independent distributors of our products 
intense competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated ability 
we compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products  compensation  support services and financial position 
sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining financial advisors  wholesalers  portfolio managers and other employees  as well as independent distributors of our products 
our sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors 
we sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives 
these representatives are not captive  which means they may also sell our competitors products 
if our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours  or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do  these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors products instead of ours 
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 
our businesses are intensely competitive 
we compete based on a number of factors including name recognition  service  the quality of investment advice  investment performance  product features  price  perceived financial strength  and claims paying and credit ratings 
our competitors include insurers  broker dealers  financial advisors  asset managers and other financial institutions 
a number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share  offer a broader range of products or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do 
in recent years  there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large  well capitalized financial services firms 
many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements 
furthermore  larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings  thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively 
we expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future  thereby increasing competitive pressure on us 
losses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments 
third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets may not pay or perform their obligations 
these parties include the issuers whose securities we hold  borrowers under the mortgage loans we make  customers  trading counterparties  counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts  reinsurers and other financial intermediaries 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  downturns in the economy or real estate values  operational failure  corporate governance issues or other reasons 
a downturn in the united states and other economies could result in increased impairments 
we may have difficulty integrating jefferson pilot and may incur substantial unexpected costs in connection with the integration 
we may experience material unanticipated difficulties or expenses in connection with integrating jefferson pilot  especially given the relatively large size of the merger 
integrating jefferson pilot with us is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
before the merger  we and jefferson pilot operated independently  each with its own business  products  customers  employees  culture and systems 
we may seek to combine certain operations  functions and legal entities using common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices  including training  professional development and benefit programs 
we may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing the integration of these systems and processes  which may cause increased operating costs  worse than anticipated financial performance or the loss of clients  employees and agents 
many of these factors are outside our control 
anti takeover provisions could delay  deter or prevent our change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to lnc shareholders 
we are an indiana corporation subject to indiana state law 
certain provisions of indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
also  provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and other 
table of contents agreements to which we are a party could delay  deter or prevent our change in control  even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  under indiana law  directors may  in considering the best interests of a corporation  consider the effects of any action on stockholders  employees  suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located  and other factors the directors consider pertinent 
one statutory provision prohibits  except under specified circumstances  lnc from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock which shareholder  under the statute  would be considered an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless such business combination is approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder 
in addition  our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders of at least three fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors  voting together  to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under indiana law 
in addition to the anti takeover provisions of indiana law  there are other factors that may delay  deter or prevent our change in control 
as an insurance holding company  we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled 
the insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval 
under those statutes and regulations  without such approval or an exemption  no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company  or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company  or merge with such a holding company  if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company or insurance company 
control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls or more of the voting securities of another person
