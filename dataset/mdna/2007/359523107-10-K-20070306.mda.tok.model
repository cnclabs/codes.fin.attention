item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech  inc fuel tech has two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineering solutions to meet the pollution control  efficiency improvement  and operational optimization needs of energy related facilities worldwide 
they are as follows nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies the nitrogen oxide nox reduction technology segment includes the noxout  noxout cascade  noxout ultra and noxout scr processes for the reduction of nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
fuel treatment chemicals the fuel treatment chemicals technology segment uses chemical processes  including tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  to control slagging  fouling  corrosion  opacity  acid plume and loss on ignition  as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide  ammonium bisulfate  particulate matter pm  carbon dioxide and nox in furnaces and boilers 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
the key market dynamic for both technology segments is the continued use of coal as the principal fuel source for global electricity production 
coal accounts for approximately of all us electricity generation  with us government projections calling for an increase to approximately by coal s share of global electricity generation is forecast to remain at approximately through major coal consumers include the united states  the prc and india 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
fuel tech discusses its critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the nitrogen oxide reduction business segment 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
fuel tech s construction contracts are typically six to twelve months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical milestones that serve as the basis for fuel tech to invoice the customer 
at a minimum  the milestones will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold to the customer 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by fuel tech are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
fuel tech has installed over units with the technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  fuel tech will perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
fuel tech believes that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts fuel tech  in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with its customer base  reviews the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of fuel tech s management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
fuel tech s historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   fuel tech adopted fasb financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the guidance of this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather  are required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the carrying value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
fuel tech reviews other intangible assets  which include a customer list  a covenant not to compete and patent assets  for impairment on a recurring basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates of future cash flows are made  however  the actual cash values that could be realized may differ from those that are estimated 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of each reporting period  fuel tech reviews the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as part of this review  fuel tech will consider if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carryback the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies which can be readily implemented 
stock based compensation fuel tech recognizes compensation expense for employee equity awards in which the expense net of tax is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
fuel tech utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards 
determining the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model requires judgment  including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option  expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of fuel tech s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option  and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab 
sab was issued to provide interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the provisions of sab were effective for fuel tech for its december  year end 
the adoption of sab had no impact on fuel tech s consolidated financial statements 
on january   fuel tech adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the company to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value 
sfas r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb 
fuel tech elected the modified prospective application method for adoption  therefore prior period financial statements have not been restated 
as a result of the implementation of r  fuel tech recognized additional compensation expense of   after tax related to stock options 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
on january   the fasb affirmed its previous decision to make fin effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  fin is effective for fuel tech on january  management has determined that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on fuel tech s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas becomes effective for fuel tech on january  upon adoption  the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on fuel tech s consolidated financial statements 
versus net sales for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year over year increase of  or  reflects an increase of  from the nitrogen oxide nox reduction technology segment and an increase of  from the fuel treatment chemical technology segment 
revenues for the nox reduction technology segment were  in  an increase of  or  over this segment continues to experience a high level of order activity as utilities and industrial facilities that are impacted by the environmental protection agency s epa state implementation plan sip call regulation and other recently introduced regulatory mandates continue to utilize fuel tech s technology as an important element of their ongoing regulatory compliance strategy 
revenues for the fuel treatment chemical business segment were  in  an increase of  or  over this segment s growth is indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  particularly on coal fired units  which represent the largest market opportunity for the technology  both domestically and abroad 
fuel tech s oil fired business was negatively impacted by the high price of oil during fuel tech s tifi technology alleviates the slagging and fouling issues associated with burning coals that are high in low melting point ash constituents  such as sodium and iron 
powder river basin prb coal  which accounts for approximately of the coal burned in the united states today to generate electricity  and illinois basin coal  are two examples of coal sources that have high levels of low melting point ash constituents 
there are coal seams across the country that provide utility units with slagging and fouling issues 
additionally  demonstrations have recently been performed on utility units that burn higher sulfur coals 
high sulfur coals represent an additional market opportunity for fuel tech  particularly as environmental regulations require coal fired utility units to install sulfur reduction technologies 
when high sulfur coal is used on a unit that has a selective catalytic reduction scr system  sulfur trioxide so and acid plume issues are created  which are a key concern in many utility and industrial operations today 
fuel tech s tifi targeted in furnace injection technology provides a solution for these issues 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and was 
the cost of sales percentage for for the nox reduction segment increased to from in the increase is attributable to the mix of project business 
for the fuel treatment chemical segment  the cost of sales percentage decreased to in from in the decrease is due to the timing of revenue recognition on cost share demonstrations and to leveraging fixed costs on higher revenue generating coal fired utility units 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the  year over year increase over is attributable to the following fuel tech recorded  in stock compensation expense in accordance with statement r  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fuel tech realized an increase in revenue related expenses in the amount of  as both technology segments had significantly improved revenue growth versus the comparable prior year period 
fuel tech recorded an increase in human resource related expenses of approximately  as staffing levels were increased in several areas in response to overall business growth 
finally  fuel tech realized incremental expenses related to audit  tax  consulting and recruiting fees  all in support of achieving business growth 
of specific note are the costs that were incurred to domesticate fuel tech 
research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech has established a more focused approach in the pursuit of commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  and in the development and analysis of new technologies that could represent incremental market opportunities 
interest income increase by almost  year over year  driven by higher average cash and short term investment balances  and market interest rates versus those experienced in the prior year 
the increase in other income is due largely to foreign exchange gains related to balances denominated in foreign currencies 
on a year to date basis  fuel tech recorded tax expense of  this amount primarily represents non cash deferred tax expense related to taxable income recognized in fuel tech s income tax benefit of  for predominantly represented the recording of the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance representing the anticipated utilization of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income  fuel tech concluded in that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses and the research and development tax credits would be utiized in subsequent periods and the valuation allowance was no longer required 
versus net sales for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year on year increase of  or  reflected gains from both the nitrogen oxide reduction nox and fuel treatment chemical business segments 
revenues for the nox product line were  in  an increase of over this business segment  which began to show increased strength in the second half of  experienced a surge in order activity 
utilities and industrial facilities that are impacted by the environmental protection agency s epa state implementation plan sip call regulation  which became effective on may   continued to prove that fuel tech s technology is a viable tool in their ongoing regulatory compliance planning 
fuel tech s strategy in addressing this market has involved the development of alliance agreements with critical customers looking to finalize their compliance plans 
revenues for the fuel treatment chemical business segment were  in  an increase of over this segment s growth  although indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  would have been enhanced had revenues not been hampered by the following circumstances during demonstration programs there were several demonstration programs during  five of which did not yield commercial revenues at december  one was a no cost demonstration at a critical coal fired utility and one was a demonstration at a large coal fired utility offered at of commercial value 
these two successful demonstrations had the impact of reducing revenue by approximately  and this revenue is non recoverable 
the other three demonstrations were structured on a cost share basis and all were on coal fired units 
under cost share arrangements  during the demonstration period  fuel tech will invoice the customer at a specified percentage of the commercial price 
at the end of the demonstration  if fuel tech meets the criteria for success that were established for the program  fuel tech will invoice the customer for the remaining percentage of the commercial price 
these latter three demonstrations reached their evaluation date in the first quarter of if revenue was recognized at commercial pricing for these latter demonstrations  an incremental  in revenue would have been realized in coal supply chain issues rail disruptions in the powder river basin during impacted several utilities ability to receive and burn powder river basin coal 
the required repair and maintenance work on several rail lines impacted coal shipments in several parts of the country well into this market dynamic negatively impacted fuel tech s revenue generating capability in as more than one critical western coal fired utility unit was forced to reduce capacity for an extended period of time due to transportation related shortages of western coal deliveries 
new sales initiatives were also negatively influenced by these issues as potential new customers were forced to delay their evaluation and implementation of the fuel chem technology 
oil pricing the high price of oil resulted in reduced oil fired electricity generation in the united states 
fuel tech s oil fired business was negatively impacted by this market dynamic in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  declined to from in the prior year 
this improvement was primarily attributable to the nitrogen oxide business  where the percentage decreased to in from in the decrease was attributable to the mix of project business 
the cost of sales percentage for the fuel treatment chemical business increased to in from in the increase was due to the impact of the demonstration programs discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of the  variance with  almost  was due to employee related costs including the wages and benefits resulting from the addition of new personnel  recruiting costs  and incentive compensation 
revenue related internal and external commission accounted for  of the increase 
the remainder of the variance was attributable to audit and audit related fees for sarbanes oxley compliance and legal and consulting fees derived from fuel tech s strategic desire to engage in business in new geographies 
research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for technologies related to its core businesses  with a particular focus on its fuel chem technologies 
the year over year increase in interest income resulted from higher average cash and short term investment balances and increased market interest rates in versus the increase in other expenses was due largely to foreign exchange losses related to balances denominated in foreign currencies 
fuel tech s income tax benefit of  for predominantly represented the recording of the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance representing the anticipated utilization of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income  fuel tech concluded that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses and the research and development tax credits would be utiized in subsequent periods and the valuation allowance was no longer required 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of  respectively 
operating activities provided  of cash during  primarily due to the favorable operating results of the business segments 
investing activities used cash of  during  as short term investments were increased by  and  was utilized to support and enhance the operations of the business  principally for equipment related to the fuel treatment chemical technology segment 
fuel tech generated cash related to the exercise of stock options in the amount of  of this amount   represents proceeds derived from the exercise price of options exercised in  while  represents the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options in fuel tech has a million revolving credit facility expiring july  the facility is unsecured and bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
fuel tech can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fuel tech is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately  was available 
there were no interest payments made during the years ended december   or in the opinion of management  fuel tech s expected near term revenue growth will be driven by the timing of penetration of the coal fired utility marketplace via utilization of its tifi technology  by utility and industrial entities adherence to the nox reduction requirements of the various domestic environmental regulations  and by the expansion of both business segments in non us geographies 
fuel tech expects its liquidity requirements to be met by the operating results generated from these activities 
contractual obligations and commitments in its normal course of business  fuel tech enters into agreements that obligate fuel tech to make future payments 
the operating lease obligations noted below are primarily related to supporting the operations of the business 
payments due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash obligations total less than year years years thereafter operating leases fuel tech has a sublease agreement that obligates the lessee to make future payments to fuel tech 
the sublease obligations noted below are related to a sublease agreement between fuel tech and american bailey corporation abc 
abc will reimburse fuel tech for its share of lease and lease related expenses under fuel tech s january  lease of its executive offices in stamford  connecticut 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the relation between fuel tech and abc 
rental payments due to fuel tech by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash obligations total less than year years years thereafter sublease fuel tech  in the normal course of business  uses bank performance guarantees and letters of credit in support of construction contracts with customers as follows in support of the warranty period defined in the contract  or in support of the system performance criteria that are defined in the contract in addition  fuel tech uses letters of credit as security for other obligations as needed in the normal course of business 
as of december   fuel tech has outstanding bank performance guarantees and letters of credit as noted in the table below commitment expiration by period in thousands of us dollars commercial commitments total less than year years years thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees off balance sheet transactions there were no off balance sheet transactions during the two year period ended december  forward looking information from time to time  information provided by fuel tech  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of fuel tech s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fuel tech s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fuel tech does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
fuel tech is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
