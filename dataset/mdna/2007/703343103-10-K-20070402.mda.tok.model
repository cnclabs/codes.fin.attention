item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general for the company  fiscal represented our third year of consecutive growth and best operating results since this was the second year in our three year strategic plan  and while was dedicated to solidifying the organizational structure and establishing a foundation for future growth  fiscal included execution of a number of initiatives including an aggressive acquisition platform  targeted sales focus  new product rollout and introductions  and concentrated efforts on operational improvement and lean manufacturing 
positive operating and sales trends from the fourth quarter of carried through to the first and second quarters of with volume levels that were at contribution points well above break even  and profitability which transferred to the bottom line 
industry conditions began to soften in the second quarter in the manufactured housing industry and in the third quarter in the recreational vehicle industry resulting in a decline in our trended sales from the first two quarters 
the fourth quarter continued this trend  especially when compared to the fourth quarter of  which included the fema shipments in both of these industries as a result of the hurricanes in the southeast in sales for the fourth quarter were down approximately from sales for increased approximately million  or when compared to our continued focus on keeping costs aligned with revenues resulted in a less than corresponding increase in operating expenses of approximately thus reflecting improved operating income from year to year 
operating income increased million  or  and net income increased approximately to million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the operating income for the year includes approximately million of incremental expenses for legal and professional fees related to our strategic acquisition efforts as the we are actively pursuing accretive acquisitions to help drive future growth 
as industry conditions are expected to remain soft through the first quarter of  we are maintaining our focus on cost control  maximization of operating margins  and increasing market penetration 
raw material product price increases  as a result of a fairly strong residential housing market through two quarters  and market penetration in all of the industries that we serve  helped to bolster overall sales levels and thus propel our sales beyond the industry trends in the manufactured housing sector 
we estimate that raw material price increases account for approximately of the year to date sales increase 
our strategic relationships with our suppliers also helped to secure product in areas where demand far exceeded supply  thus driving a premium  not only for the product availability and pricing  but further solidifying patrick industries  inc as a quality and valuable source of materials to our customer base 
during the third and fourth quarters and carrying over into the first quarter of  the residential housing market appears to be showing signs of decline and therefore may result in less demand on certain of our products 
this could impact product pricing as supply catches up with the demand in the residual markets including manufactured housing 
inventory levels increased throughout the course of the year and finished the year approximately million over the december levels due primarily to increased raw material prices from period to period  strategic purchasing initiatives implemented  uncertainty with regard to shipping schedules on product purchased from overseas  and a faster than expected market softening in all of the sectors we serve 
the manufactured housing industry  which represents of our sales for the year ending december   experienced shipment decreases of approximately from shipment levels in this industry  exclusive of fema units  have remained relatively flat for the past four years and are operating at the lowest levels since while this industry is still plagued by financing concerns  including lack of funding sources  permanent rebuilding in the new orleans area  rising interest rates  mild inflation and improved job growth may favorably impact this industry going forward 
as certain housing manufacturers continue their penetration into the modular housing sector  the demand for our manufactured custom panels continues to shift to our distribution products which include  but are not limited to  the raw substrates and tape and texture products 
the recreational vehicle industry  which represents approximately of our sales for the year ended december   began to show signs of softening in the third quarter as shipment increases of  and in the first and second quarters of were partially offset by declines in shipments of approximately and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
year to date  shipments in this industry are approximately better than the year end figures 
while rising gasoline prices have had an impact on motorized units  the towable unit shipments were fairly strong for the first six months of the year and began to show signs of decline in the third quarter 
towable unit shipments decreased approximately from the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of the increased fema shipments in  and were up approximately year to date 
sales to the towable segment of the market approximate of our total recreational vehicle industry market sales 
we expect these soft industry conditions to continue at least through the first and second quarters of additionally  market conditions could remain depressed in the short term while fema attempts to sell off its excess yard inventories and used units 
many of the used units are damaged and will most likely have to be severely discounted to be sold 
our diversification efforts into the industrial and other markets  which represent approximately of our sales for the year ended december   resulted in additional market penetration of approximately million for the year 
customer attrition continued from the first quarter of accounting for approximately million of lost sales due to import pressures and financial and other circumstances at several of our larger customers 
new sources of demand are developing in this market sector  however  not quickly enough to offset the losses of these large clients 
our efforts to penetrate and gain market share in these industries continues because we believe certain of our core competencies including quality customer service  short order lead times  and high volume quality manufacturing are a strategic fit for the requirements of this customer base 
we believe that we have established our platform for future growth and are well positioned to increase revenues in all of the markets that we serve  without adding significant fixed overhead 
while market conditions are expected to remain soft at least partially into  key focus areas for include identifying and executing strategic accretive acquisitions  capturing market share  implementation of lean manufacturing in all of our manufacturing operations  maintaining a lean organizational structure  controlling costs  and growing all areas of the business

sale of property not applicable 
purchase of property not applicable 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap agreement effectively converts a portion of our variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
we utilize a mix of investment maturities based on our anticipated cash needs and evaluation of existing interest rates and market conditions 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
