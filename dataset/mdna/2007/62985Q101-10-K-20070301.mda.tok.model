use of non gaap financial measures ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are measures used by management to measure operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is also used to determine our compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
ebitda is defined as net earnings plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges  as permitted under our senior discount note  senior note and senior subordinated note indentures and our senior credit facility 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and minority interest charges 
we believe ebitda is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
we consider the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash for the repayment of debt 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not recognized terms under us gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net earnings loss as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the most direct comparable gaap financial measures of each non gaap financial measure  as well as the reconciliation between each non gaap financial measure and the gaap financial measure  are presented in the discussions of the non gaap financial measures below 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  including chemicals and equipment  is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided to the customer 
significant estimates used in recognizing revenues include the delay between the time that chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by customers and title transfers and the amount of credit memos to be issued in subsequent periods 
we provide our chemical and equipment offerings to our customers using various commercial arrangements  but the following are most commonly used ship and bill arrangements 
following the receipt of a purchase order from the customer  we invoice the customer at the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped  based on agreed pricing and the volume of chemicals shipped or units of equipment shipped 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the product and the risks of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  adjustments to revenues and cost of product sold are made to account for the delay between the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
our sales policy does not provide for general rights of return and does not contain customer acceptance clauses 

table of contents usage with level billing arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer 
as agreed with the customer  a fixed amount is invoiced monthly based on this estimate 
at the end of each quarter  we reconcile the actual amount of chemicals used by the customer and bill the customer for products actually used during that period 
revenue is recognized to reflect actual usage 
for any products not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period  we retain ownership of such products on a consigned basis and do not recognize any revenue 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer during the contractual period  which is usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  typically monthly 
we retain ownership  on a consigned basis  of any inventory at the customer site that is not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period 
revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period  which is generally consistent with the customer s usage of the chemicals 
under these arrangements  as part of the sales cycle for our chemical programs  our technical and sales representatives may visit our customers facilities to develop and monitor the chemical programs 
typically  there is no contractual obligation for these visits  or any penalty for not visiting the customer sites 
during these visits  our employees perform routine testing activities to ensure that our chemical products functionalities are having the desired effect on the customers equipment eg  boilers  chillers and water treatment plants 
in the majority of instances  our customers perform the on going application of the chemicals 
at the same time  the sales representatives investigate and determine whether the customers have needs for additional applications from nalco 
we consider our technical and sales representatives activities in this regard to be an integral and inherent part of our selling process and not a separate deliverable for revenue recognition purposes 
some of our customers  however  look to us for our technical expertise only  without the purchase of chemicals equipment 
we offer specialized services designed to assess  control  and reduce risk from water borne pathogens such as legionella  and we provide other technical and analytical services 
we invoice for our services using various commercial arrangements  but the following arrangements are the most common perform and bill arrangements 
revenue is recognized in the same period that the related service is performed  based on the agreed pricing  which can be either a price per hour or a fixed fee 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we estimate the saleable service that will be performed during a given period  usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  which may be monthly  quarterly  or annually  either in arrears or in advance of the services provided 
because an unspecified number of similar acts are performed within a fixed period of performance  revenue is recognized ratably over the period of performance 
time and material arrangements 
the fee with the customer is structured on a time and material basis  and revenue is recognized in the same period that the work is completed 
in certain arrangements  which are usually reserved for our largest customers  we provide some combination or all of the following deliverables chemicals  equipment and on site technical expertise 
in these arrangements  we usually remain the owner of any equipment at the customer site 
at the end of the contractual relationship  the equipment is either recovered or sold to the customer or a competitor 
additionally  our representatives may have a regular presence at a customer s facility  which is provided under a contract 
over time  the representatives have gained a true expertise in the particular production water treatment process at the customer s facility  and are able to selectively apply our specific chemical programs given the customer environment water quality  equipment type  etc the regular presence of the representative permits us to closely track the results of the program and to make modifications to the program as necessary for the highest efficiency 

table of contents the following two types of commercial arrangements are the most commonly used for the sale of multiple deliverables production based arrangements 
our billing is based on a customer s production based formula eg  dollars per ton of paper produced within certain technical parameters 
we use a combination of our service chemicals  on site technical expertise and equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
the chemicals and equipment used and on site technical expertise required are highly correlated with the customer s production 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the production based formula 
usage based arrangements 
for these arrangements  we invoice according to the consumption of chemicals by the customer 
the agreed price by kilogram or pound of chemical consumed also includes the availability of on site expertise and the use of equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the usage based formula 
for all of our commercial arrangements  we also record estimated reserves for anticipated non collectible accounts and for product returns and other credits at the time revenue is recognized 
impairment of long lived assets other than intangibles we conduct periodic reviews for idle equipment and review business plans for possible impairment implications 
porta feed stainless steel containers  utilized to ship chemicals  represent approximately of our property  plant and equipment and are managed globally to optimize the delivery of chemicals to customer and company sites around the world 
due to their high mobility  there is a risk that porta feeds could be damaged or lost in transit 
we perform continuous cycle counts of our porta feeds and when such counts are inconsistent with our tracking system  we investigate the discrepancy in order to locate the container 
if the porta feed is not found  we write off the asset immediately 
we capitalize qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use  including the costs of the software  materials  consultants  interest and payroll and payroll related costs for employees dedicated to the development 
we must use our judgment in determining whether the direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and an employee s time and travel expenses directly associated with developing software are recoverable and should be capitalized 
we base our determination on the nature and the extent of the activity that the employee is performing 
a significant portion of our capitalized software costs relates to our sap implementation 
goodwill and other intangible assets carrying values of goodwill  customer relationships  trademarks  trade names  patents  developed technology and other intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment using a discounted cash flow approach 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions could impact whether an impairment charge is required and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
future outcomes may also differ 
if we fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experience unfavorable market conditions or achieve results that differ from our estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
pensions accounting for pensions involves the selection of a discount rate and an expected rate of return that we apply to a market related value of plan assets 
this methodology generally reduces the volatility of pension expense that would have otherwise resulted from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that are expected to be available through the maturity dates of the pension benefits and receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency  and we review the assumption with our actuary 

table of contents the assets in the principal domestic pension plan are diversified across equity and fixed income investments 
the investment portfolio has target allocations of approximately equity  fixed income and alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity 
other assets such as real estate may be used judiciously to enhance portfolio returns and diversification 
the expected long term rate of return is established using historical market data for each asset class as well as the target allocation 
historical markets are analyzed and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income investments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility will generate a greater return over the long run 
active management is employed in most asset classes  which also contributes to the return assumption 
the total weighted average return on each asset class supports our long term expected rate of return assumption 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually through comparison of our historical actual rates of return with our expectations  consultation with our actuary regarding the assumptions used by other large companies and consultation with our investment managers regarding their expectations for future returns 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years in determining pension expense 
other postretirement benefits accounting for other postretirement benefits requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency and we review the assumption with our actuary 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
income taxes we estimate our income tax consequences in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this results in recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to recognize the temporary differences caused by the timing of recognition of income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
valuation allowances are determined based on the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
relevant factors to determine the realizability of the assets include future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 
valuation allowances are established for those assets that are determined to be more likely than not to expire without benefit  or for which income of the proper character is not anticipated 
the effect of a valuation allowance expected to be necessary for a deferred tax asset at the end of the year for originating deductible temporary differences and carryforwards is included in the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the effect of a change in the beginning of the year balance of a valuation allowance resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations  and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken 
however  these positions are subject to audit and review by the tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations  we have reserved tax contingencies including related interest for positions that we consider the likelihood of being sustained to be less than probable 
the tax reserves are reevaluated throughout the year  taking into account new legislation  regulations  case law and audit results 

table of contents environmental our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use and handling of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services  some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party  or prp  by the environmental protection agency or state enforcement agencies at three waste sites where some financial contribution is or may be required 
these agencies have also identified many other parties who may be responsible for clean up costs at the waste disposal sites 
our financial contribution to remediate these sites is expected to be minor 
there has been no significant financial impact on us up to the present  nor is it anticipated that there will be in the future  as a result of these matters 
we have made and will continue to make provisions for these costs if our liability becomes probable and when costs can be reasonably estimated 
we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances  including multi party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services 
while we do not believe that based upon present information that any of these suits will be material to us  there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
historically  our expenditures relating to environmental compliance and clean up activities have not been significant 
the environmental reserves represent our current estimate of our proportional clean up costs and are based upon negotiation and agreement with enforcement agencies  our previous experience with respect to clean up activities  detailed review of known conditions  and information about other prps 
the reserves are not reduced by any possible recoveries from insurance companies or other prps not specifically identified 
although given the evolving nature of environmental regulations  we cannot determine whether or not a material effect on future operations is reasonably likely to occur  we believe that the recorded reserve levels are appropriate estimates of the potential liability 
although settlements will require future cash outlays  it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position  although there can be no assurance that such impacts could not occur 
executive level overview in  we met our key objectives on sales  earnings and cash generation 
sales increased to billion in from billion in the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  sales increased  including real growth 
we define real growth as organic growth less price increases that are passed on to simply recover higher costs 
foreign currency impacts added to revenue growth in 
table of contents net earnings increased to million  with diluted earnings per share doubling to cents from the year earlier cents 
adjusted ebitda of million was up from million generated in we generated free cash flow of million in  a solid improvement over the million reported for net cash provided by operating activities is reconciled to free cash flow as follows

the business segments performed quite well in  with energy services having an excellent year 
for the year  energy services organic sales growth was  with real growth contributing about two thirds of that improvement 
the upstream adomite business grew better than organically  and both our upstream oil field and downstream businesses also grew at double digit rates 
growth in energy services has been driven by investments in innovative products and services as well as in hiring and training people ahead of expansion of the business 
we did a significant amount of hiring and training at the beginning of the year to ensure we could handle the growth we saw coming 
this enabled us to maintain business strength through the year 
however  the pace of our growth was even better than expected 
in  we are again making sizable investments in hiring and training new sales and service engineers in select geographies 
the industrial and institutional services i is business also had a good year in  delivering organic growth that included very good price gains 
in north america  we performed particularly well in the power  chemicals  food and beverage  and mining markets  with strong growth also taking place geographically in latin america  eastern europe  the middle east  and africa 
process service business groups that produce personal care ingredients and colloidal micro particle products used in investment casting  semiconductors  and catalyst systems also performed well 
in i is as a whole  we are looking forward to expanding our pace of real growth as we are able to focus our sales engineers on expansion opportunities as we move through our d trasar cooling water technology continues to be a key advantage 
installations during surpassed the number during the prior months and we now have more than  units installed 
we have the greatest rate of success with our largest customers  but have significant room to grow our business with mid sized and small customers 
only about of our applications have come from competitively held accounts  while more than of the water treatment business is served by competitors 
as we improve our penetration with existing customers who are our first priority with any new program we can shift our attention to competitively held accounts 
we believe we will continue to reap the benefits of improved margins and competitive advantage for several more years with d trasar  and have yet to see any real competitive response 
in  we intend to focus on faster market penetration with d trasar in europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
one of the key levers we are pulling in is a change to profit based compensation for the remainder of our sales force 
this should also help improve our speed to market with d trasar 
our latest technology always offers greater net benefits to our customers  as well as better profitability for nalco 
so  a profit oriented sales engineer will be more apt to learn and sell our newest technology than a revenue compensated sales engineer 

table of contents our paper services business had a challenging year  with sales up organically  but ended with a strong fourth quarter and full innovation pipeline that provide reason for optimism 
cost increases have been the greatest on products used by our paper customers  including increases that occurred into the fourth quarter 
because of this  and market conditions  we have more work to do on price increases in this business 
innovation will play a key role in helping to improve sales and margins in our paper business  and several new offerings are being met with good customer reception 
from the standpoint of paper sales growth  we performed best in latin america 
we grew a bit more slowly in asia pacific than in recent years  as we absorbed and stabilized the new paper machine business in china that we captured in higher growth rates are expected once again in paper in asia pacific  as evidenced by new business run rates as we exited the new leadership team brought to this business mid year is focused on improving our speed to market with product innovation 
we have an impressive and growing suite of value added technologies to bring to our paper customers  but had been slow in the past in the commercialization process 
we are particularly pleased with initial progress in a new extra white brightness enhancing technology and our pareto wet end optimization technology  which can save customers significant amounts of energy and water 
on a total company basis  price increases were greater than the new costs incurred in  making up for and  during which our price achievement trailed the purchased material and freight cost increases we absorbed 
other cost increases  for the carrying costs of inventory and receivables  and for higher service and other operating expenses  still need to be covered with additional pricing 
the pricing actions that are planned and being executed in will address these remaining issues 
our principal business concern continues to be europe 
the challenges faced there are driven by the fact that we have continued to operate highly fragmented european entities since our integration in with calgon and the collection of european water treatment companies then owned by suez that were called aquazur 
the integration of these operations was never fully completed  including actions such as establishing shared service centers for finance  customer service and other activities 
we remain in the process of making these changes  and can see progress being made each day 
we look forward to serving our customers with a much better platform  and our business plans reflect expected steady improvement in our financial results in europe as we progress in revenue growth in played an important role in our substantial earnings improvements  but net earnings also benefited from several other notable accomplishments

cost savings of million for the year fell just short of our annual target of million 
delays in two large work process improvement projects prevented us from achieving our target 
our actual result drove our average annual savings over the past three years down to million 
cost savings more than offset additional compensation excluding the impact of restoring our variable compensation program  benefits and investments we made during the year to expand research and development and our selling and service teams 
the strength of the energy services business was a key part of our plan  so we invested in hiring and training new sales engineers  particularly in the first quarter 
those investments  which exceeded the levels we initially planned in the year  were rewarded with continued strong momentum through the year and a solid growth platform for 
table of contents following the twin difficulties in of unusually significant raw material cost increases and the us gulf coast hurricanes  our results represented a return to solid  stable growth 
this success was expected  and it was also important 
while proved the strength of our business model  as we grew adjusted ebitda despite difficult obstacles  we demonstrated in that we could quickly return to our long term improvement targets 
outlook real growth in sales is expected to average about in  up modestly from the achieved in price is expected to play a more modest role in our sales gains in  bringing our total organic growth to more than 
this comes after two years in which rapid increases in purchased materials and freight made cost recovery through pricing a critical part of our objectives 
adjusted ebitda should grow faster than revenues  with our growth target set at 
year over year price increases will outpace costs as we catch up on some of the ancillary costs we have absorbed in the past  such as the indirect costs that come from rapid raw material cost moves including the carrying costs of inventory 
in order to hit our aggressive earnings objectives  we again plan to gain million in cost savings during  with a modest bottom line benefit after subtracting higher employee compensation and benefit costs and investments in expanding selling  service and research and development activities 
free cash flow is targeted at better than improvement  aided by earnings growth  strong improvements in operating working capital and lower tax payments outside the united states  partially offset by increased capital expenditures and non operating working capital requirements for items such as variable incentive payments that will be paid in the first quarter of several key components in deriving adjusted ebitda and free cash flow in are expected to be as follows

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase from the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  net sales were up 
of this improvement  was attributed to price increase  while the remaining was driven by real growth

higher sales volume and the impact of higher selling prices  partly offset by the effect of increased costs of raw and other purchased materials  contributed to this change 
the improvement was also partly attributable to an inventory write off of million during the year ended december  in  we recognized partial business interruption insurance recoveries of million related to last year s hurricanes 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ago period 
selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million increased million  or  from  million for the year ended december  on an organic basis  selling  administrative  and research expenses increased 
slightly more than half of this increase was attributable to selling expense  which was primarily due to higher salaries  commission expenses  employee benefits  bad debts  and outside services 
administrative expenses increased from the year ago period due to higher employee incentive plan expenses  employee benefits  and outside consulting related to our work process redesign initiatives and the rationalization of our legal entity structure 
amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method

the industrial and institutional services division reported organic growth of in  the majority of which was attributable to price increases  with solid gains  exclusive of price increases  posted by our water treatment business in the latin american and pacific regions  as well as our marine and pacific region mining businesses 
these gains were offset by sales declines  exclusive of price increases  in north america and  more notably  europe 
difficulties in adapting work processes following our sap system conversion in europe on january  and the generally slower economy in our largest western european markets were among the causes of the sales decline in europe 
higher sales during the three months ended december  was another contributing factor  as european customers purchased in advance to avoid risking any potential complications from the system conversion 
despite lost sales in the gulf of mexico due to unusually disruptive hurricanes during  the energy services division reported a strong organic improvement in sales of in  more than half of which represented real growth 
strong performances were made by the oil field business  downstream refining  and our petrochemical business 
solid growth in latin america  rapid growth in the pacific region  and a more modest improvement in north america contributed to the organic growth in paper services division sales in these improvements were partly offset by lower paper services sales in europe  resulting from labor strikes faced by our finnish customers earlier in the year and the aforementioned factors that affected industrial and institutional services sales in the region 
most of the organic improvement in other sales in was attributable to alternate channel sales  our subsidiary company in india  and our japanese joint venture  katayama nalco 
the increase in other sales attributable to acquisitions divestitures represents the incremental impact of sales for the first five months of by katayama nalco  which was formed with katayama chemical inc on june

although the industrial and institutional services division did well in capturing price increases during  our sales force was distracted from focusing on real growth 
as a result  most of the organic growth in sales was offset by higher raw material and freight costs 
the energy services division reported direct contribution of million for the year ended december   a increase over the million reported for on an organic basis  direct contribution increased 
higher sales volume and the impact of price increases accounted for most of the improvement  partly offset by increased raw material and freight costs 
the paper services division reported direct contribution of million for the year ended december   a decrease from the million reported for organically  direct contribution was down  as a competitive environment that was slower to respond to the rising raw and other purchased material costs challenged our ability to obtain price increases 
the direct contribution loss of million reported in other for the year ended december   represented a decrease of million from the million direct contribution loss reported for organically  direct contribution improved 
this reflected the favorable impact of a million charge to cost of product sold in resulting from the sale of inventory that had been revalued at selling price less costs to sell in purchase accounting at the date of the acquisition

historically  our main source of liquidity has been our solid cash flow generated by operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase of million from the improvement was mainly the result of the increase in net earnings and not making any payments in for variable incentive plans 
partly offsetting these improvements were higher contributions to the principal us pension plan and higher cash requirements for inventories and accounts payable

of the remainder  million relates to net cash used to increase the investment in our subsidiary in india 
net property additions of million accounted for most of the million of cash used for investing activities in the year ended december  in  cash used for investing activities was million  as net property additions of million were partly offset by a million purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition 
slightly more than one third of the capital spending in was attributable to an investment in a common information systems platform for north america and europe  which was fully implemented in january financing activities 
net cash used for financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which was mostly attributable to a net decrease in borrowings 
in  we prepaid the remaining balance of million on the us dollar portion of our term loan a debt  made a scheduled payment on our euro denominated term loan a debt of million  and prepaid million of our term loan b borrowings 
most of the million of cash used for financing activities during the year ended december  was attributable to prepayments of our term loan a debt totaling million and a million reduction in borrowings from our receivables facility

the remaining million of the net proceeds was used toward the redemption of a portion of the senior discount notes due  including the payment of the applicable redemption premium of million 
since the transactions  we have been highly leveraged 
our liquidity requirements are significant  primarily due to debt service requirements as well as research and development and capital investment 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow generated from operations  but we also have availability under a million revolving credit facility and a million receivables facility  in each case subject to certain conditions 
we believe that our financial position and financing structure will provide flexibility in worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets

principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full at maturity on november  as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit facilities contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and our subsidiaries ability  including nalco company  to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay other indebtedness  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase certain capital stock  create liens on assets  make investments  loans or advances  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness  change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries including nalco company and enter into hedging agreements 
in addition  the senior credit facilities require nalco company to maintain the following financial covenants a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum capital expenditures limitation 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  senior discount notes  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
as part of the transactions  in november  nalco company issued million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior subordinated notes due on january   our subsidiaries  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc  issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due prior to february   interest will accrue on the notes in the form of an increase in the accreted 
table of contents value of such notes 
the accreted value of each note will increase from the date of issuance until february  at a rate of per annum  reflecting the accrual of non cash interest  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity on february  cash interest payments on the notes will be due and payable beginning in our primary source of liquidity for such payments will be cash flow generated from the operations of subsidiaries  including nalco holdings and nalco company 
however  the terms of nalco company s senior credit agreement limit the amount of dividends and other transfers by nalco holdings and our other subsidiaries to the issuers of the senior discount notes 
in addition  the terms of certain of the indentures governing the existing senior notes and senior subordinated notes of nalco company significantly restrict nalco company and our other subsidiaries from paying dividends  making distributions and otherwise transferring assets to the issuers 
the ability of nalco company to make such payments is governed by a formula based on its consolidated net income 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to the issuers based on such formula  nalco holdings must have an adjusted ebitda to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
notwithstanding such restrictions  such indentures permit an aggregate of million of such payments to be made whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met

subject to certain exceptions  the indentures governing the senior discount notes  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes permit our restricted subsidiaries and us to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness 
covenant compliance 
the breach of covenants in our senior credit agreement that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under that agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indentures 
additionally  under our debt agreements  our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is used to determine our compliance with many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes and in our senior credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures and our senior credit facility 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants

our senior credit facility requires us to maintain an adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio which started at a minimum of x and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio which started at a maximum of x  in each case for the most recent four quarter period 
failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default under the senior credit agreement 
if our lenders failed to waive any such default  our repayment obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under our indentures

permitted investments without regard to the ratio  such as up to an aggregate principal amount of  million including million that was outstanding under our term loan facilities as of december  and investments in similar business and other investments equal to of nalco holding company consolidated assets 
local lines of credit 
certain of our non us subsidiaries have lines of credit to support local requirements 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these local lines of credit was approximately million 
certain of these lines of credit are equally and ratably secured with obligations under our senior credit facilities 
receivables facility 
nalco company entered into a three year receivables facility on june  that provides up to million in funding from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by jpmorgan chase bank  one of the lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities  based on availability of eligible receivables and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
at the closing  we received million in proceeds  which we used to repay term loans under the senior credit facilities 
in connection with the receivables facility  we established a wholly owned consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary  nalco receivables llc the transferor  to which nalco company the seller sells trade accounts receivable the receivables pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement 
pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement  the transferor then transfers an undivided interest in the purchased receivables to the commercial paper conduit or the related bank sponsor the transferees in exchange for cash 
the transferor s purchase of receivables from the seller is financed through the simultaneous transfer of this undivided interest in the purchased receivables  together with cash contributed to it by nalco company and the advances made by the seller under an intercompany note 
nalco company  as the receivables collection agent  services  administers and collects the receivables under the receivables transfer agreement for which it receives a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
borrowings under the receivables facility bear interest at a floating base rate plus a usage fee 
the usage fee varies based upon our leverage ratio as calculated under the senior credit facilities and is currently of the amount funded 
in addition  the transferor is required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the receivables facility that varies based upon the same ratio and is currently of the unused portion of the commitments 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance from time to time 
aggregate availability is determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into account historical default and dilution rates  excessive concentrations and average days outstanding and the costs of the facility 
based on the terms of this facility and on the criteria described above  as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable balance was considered eligible for financing under the program  of which approximately million would have been available for funding 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility 
this facility is treated as a general financing agreement resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as interest expense

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the statement does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value  and it does not establish requirements for recognizing dividend income  interest income or interest expense 
it also does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
we are required to adopt sfas no

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
because we are indemnified by suez for material tax exposures that originate in periods prior to november   the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded by adjusting our tax contingencies  long term receivable for the indemnity  and accumulated deficit

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments as necessary to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we manage foreign currency exchange risk arising from financial activities pursuant to our corporate guidelines 
forward contracts and  occasionally  swaps and options are utilized to protect these cash flows from adverse movements in exchange rates  and we account for these instruments by marking them to market at each balance sheet date 
we may also employ hedge accounting as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  we use certain foreign currency debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
upon issuance  we designated the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  and the million term loan as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose assets  liabilities  and operations are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the euro denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment 
accordingly  changes in the value of the euro denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  to offset changes in the value of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose financial statements are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
we formally assess  on a quarterly basis  whether the euro denominated debt is effective at offsetting changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash pretax loss in the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment account related to this hedge 
no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in income 
we also manage operational transactional foreign currency risk  particularly in emerging markets  by closely managing both pricing and raw material sourcing 
risks associated with foreign exchange translation exposures are not hedged 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our derivative foreign currency instruments outstanding at december  and  a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are denominated would result in a gain or loss in fair values of less than million and million  respectively 
at december   nalco company s forecasted natural gas utility requirements were approximately hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts at an average cost of per mmbtu 
these contracts had a notional value of million and have delivery dates from january through december based on year end nymex prices  we had a net unrealized loss on our natural gas forward contracts at december  of million 
assuming that year end natural gas prices were to increase or decrease by  the gain or loss in fair value would be less than million 
at december   we had  million of variable rate debt 
a increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by approximately million per year 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of the changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other operating transactions 
the analysis also does not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes
