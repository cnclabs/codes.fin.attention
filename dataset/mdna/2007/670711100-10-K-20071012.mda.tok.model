discontinued operations had taxable income  realizing a gain of  restricted assets and uncertainties the pharmacy acquisition agreement  described below  includes provisions whereby the pharmacies are able to restrict the transfer of funds to the parent or to other subsidiaries any funds in excess of their required management fees 
in august of  the company and the shareholders of daw entered into a stock exchange agreement and plan of reorganization whereby the company acquired by exchange with the sellers of the issued and outstanding stock of daw the board of directors of daw is comprised of five members  two designated by the minority shareholders shareholders  two designated by the company and a fifth director not affiliated with the shareholders or the company 
the fifth seat on the board is vacant 
as part of an associated shareholders agreement  the company and the shareholders will not vote any of their shares in favor of  or consent to any merger of daw with another entity or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of daw unless of the daw s board of directors vote in favor of the transaction 
the associated shareholders agreement and a related agreement also provide for a specific management fee the management fee of  per month  to be paid by daw to the company and for the shareholders management of manage the day to day operations of the pharmacy subsidiaries of the company  which has included cash management 
four of the shareholders of daw and the husband of another shareholder have employment agreements which expired in august which agreements were replaced by oral  at will agreements  described herein at item executive compensation 
when the agreements expired  the shareholders had the right to require the company to purchase all or any portion of their shares of daw and the other subsidiary of the company held by these persons 
in august  the company entered into a forbearance agreement with the shareholders which stated accomplished the following the company acknowledges that of the shares of the subsidiaries of the company the subsidiaries held by each shareholder the put shares have been offered to the company for purchase 
the shareholders agree to refrain from requiring the company to immediately pay the fair market value of the put shares until the earlier of i the closing of the transaction s among the company  the shareholders and the subsidiaries with respect to the potential purchase by the company of all of the shares held by the shareholders in the subsidiaries the purchase  which may be accomplished by payment in full of immediately available funds  and ii july  the company agrees to pay  per month in total to certain shareholders from the first business day of august until the earlier of i the closing of the purchase  and ii december   and  per month from and after december  until the closing of the purchase

the parties to the forbearance agreement agreed that the fair market value of the put shares is million the amount 
the arbitration clause of the forbearance agreement was deleted in its entirety and replaced with a provision agreeing to jurisdiction and venue in the business litigation session of the superior court for the commonwealth of massachusetts 
the purchase has not occurred  the amount has not been paid by the company to the minority shareholders and the monthly payment amounts have not been repaid by the company to daw on july   mark dumouchel  as representative of the minority shareholders  signed the following statement as the representative of the minority shareholders the minority shareholders of daw  inc daw and daw franchise co  inc 
fmt  i  mark dumouchel  hereby state that the minority shareholders do not presently intend to a take any action with respect to any provisions of either the shareholders agreement  dated as of august   by and among the minority shareholders  daw  fmt and nyer medical group  inc or the agreement  dated as of august   by and among the same parties or b enforce any remedies available to them under either of such agreements 
these statements represent the minority shareholders intentions as of the date hereof only and no assurance can be given that such intentions will not change in the future  whether or not there occurs any change of circumstances 
on september   the company received a notice the notice from counsel to daw the notice states that the company has failed to pay timely its debt obligation owed to daw in the amount of at least  the debt pursuant to the forbearance agreement  and that unless payment is immediately received  daw will pursue all legal remedies as it may choose 
further  the notice also stated that as a result of the company s failure to pay timely the debt  daw has immediately ceased any payments to nyer under a certain management agreement or otherwise the payments 
the payments are crucial to the company in helping the company to meet its day to day operational financial needs 
if the payments do not resume in the near future  the company and its shareholders may suffer in a materially adverse manner 
the company is in contact with the minority shareholders and is involved in ongoing discussions attempting to remedy the situation which exists  although the company does not have a specific plan to resolve the relevant issues 
if the amounts owing to each of daw and the shareholders described above cannot be raised and or if some other acceptable arrangement cannot be negotiated  then daw and the shareholders may enforce their rights with respect to the payment of such amounts 
although the company is involved in ongoing discussions to satisfy daw and the shareholders  at this time  the company does not have a specific plan to satisfy such parties  and daw and the shareholders may then seek to enforce their rights in a manner which would be materially adverse to the company and its shareholders if the outstanding issues are not resolved 
the company and four of the shareholders and the husband of another shareholder are also presently attempting to negotiate employment agreements agreeable to all parties 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully negotiate such employment agreements 
if not  and or issues surrounding payments due to daw and the shareholders are not resolved  certain of the shareholders could seek employment elsewhere and this would  in the short run  leave no management team for the pharmacies and cause the company to have to assemble an entirely new management team  which could be extremely difficult to do  therefore leaving the company with no way in which to manage the significant revenue producing subsidiary of the company

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables we maintain a reserve for the amount of receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is estimated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventories included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which that our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment in the fourth quarter and annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and comparing this amount to the carrying value 
goodwill impairment in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes we have significant deferred tax assets 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability considering our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments
