critical accounting policies and significant estimates our significant accounting policies and significant estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped  the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  and collection of related receivable is probable 
the allowances for returns are recorded at the time of revenue recognition  if the right of return exists  as a reduction of accounts receivable and are determined based on our historical returns experience  which is monitored on a monthly and annual basis 
we recognize our subscription based revenue from measuring up e path prorata over the life of the agreement 
deferred prepublication costs deferred prepublication costs are recorded at their original cost and amortized over a three or five year period  based on the estimated lives of the related publications 
the net carrying value of the deferred prepublication costs is periodically reviewed and compared to an estimate of future net undiscounted cash flows 
on may  and  we had a valuation allowance against this asset of  and  respectively 
if future net undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to realize the net carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge will be recognized 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide credit to our customers on a customer by customer basis 
we review the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis along with historical loss experience to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts of  at both may  and is believed to be adequate for any exposure to loss 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory we continuously monitor our inventory on hand for salability 
this monitoring includes review of historical sales experience  projected sales activity by title  and any planned changes to a title that are known by us 
any slow moving or non salable inventory identified is reserved or written down at that time 
the reserves of approximately  and  at may  and are believed to be adequate to cover inventory loss exposure 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment on january  sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards 
dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate  but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in compensation expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
we believe the assumptions used in computing our compensation expense for the periods ended may  and  respectively  are appropriate 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states  based on estimates and assumptions 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on management s estimates of future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the requirements for a valuation allowance

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
gives companies an irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning june   although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements  only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we have evaluated the impact of adopting fin on june  and found that we presently do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities for was primarily provided by our profitability before depreciation and amortization as well as a decrease in income taxes refundable 
this was offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and deposits and a decrease in accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased as a result of increased fourth quarter revenues on a year over year basis 
inventory increased due to a higher number of products being offered for sale 
prepaid expenses and deposits and other assets increased due to our investment in product sampling 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased primarily due to the timing of payment to vendors 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in net cash used in investing activities for consisted primarily of expenditures for prepublication costs of million in  which represents a decrease of million from the decrease is primarily due to efficiencies realized within our product development process  which allowed us to reduce the development costs on new and revised titles 
in addition  unlike when we launched the focused instruction product line  no new product lines were launched in net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in net cash provided by financing activities for  consisted primarily of net borrowings under our new bank agreement for both the line of credit and term loan 

table of contents on february   we entered into a million credit agreement with sovereign bank to refinance our previous bank credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides for advances up to million and expires in march the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is in a range from libor plus to libor plus  or prime to prime plus  with the exact interest rate based on the ratio of the company s total funded debt to ebitda 
at may   million was outstanding under this facility  and million was still available for borrowing 
the term loan is for million and matures in december the term loan provides for payments of interest only for the first twelve months and for equal quarterly payments of principal and interest thereafter until maturity 
the term loan bears interest at the same rate as the revolving line of credit for million of the million outstanding 
we entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the balance of the term loan for three years at a rate of plus an interest spread of to based upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
after the three year period  the interest rate reverts back to a variable rate 
in july  the company entered into a million letter of credit agreement with sovereign bank 
the interest rate on the letter of credit is in a range from libor plus to libor plus  or prime to prime plus  with the exact interest rate based on the ratio of the company s total funded debt to ebitda 
the agreement expires may  amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiary  which  among other things  impose a maximum ratio of total funded debt to ebitda  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these financial covenants restrict the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
during  we completed a public offering of common stock for the sale of  shares at per share 
the proceeds of million were offset by approximately  in related offering costs  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  the underwriter was granted a warrant to purchase  shares of company common stock at an exercise price of per share 
such warrant became exercisable in june and expires in june a summary of our contractual cash obligations at may   are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total thereafter term loan excluding interest  see note line of credit excluding interest  see note capital leases including interest portion operating leases total we believe that our cash and borrowing availability under our lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our normal cash needs in we intend to continue investing in prepublication costs for our proprietary products to the extent cash flow allows 
as we develop these products for more states  additional working capital investments will be required 
product development product development expenditures for the twelve months ended may  were million  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the expenditures in were significantly higher than as they included the launching of our focused instruction products  the entry into one new state with our measuring up products and addition of new and revised products in our existing states 
we continue to actively develop new and revised products  but as a result of 
table of contents operational efficiencies we have been able to significantly reduce our development expenditures 
product development expenditures in were primarily in the testing  assessment  and instruction product group as we continued to roll out new and revised products within our existing states 
the state test preparation market continues to grow  as the states demand higher academic performance from students 
most states have high stakes testing requirements  which means that students  teachers  and administrators are rewarded for positive test performance or penalized for poor performance 
the support for state standards and testing has been enhanced considerably by the mandates of the no child left behind federal legislation 
presently  we publish test preparation and assessment products for various grades in twelve states 
we intend to focus our product development in the upcoming year on our core  state specific products 
we intend to enter additional states and continue to supplement existing states with additional products 
we also plan to expand our offering of measuring up e path  our electronic  web based assessment and scoring product 
our focused instruction product offering consists of supplemental instruction products that align with state standards in mathematics  reading  and language arts for grades late in  an editorial office was opened in austin  texas  and their focus is to develop and publish supplemental products in more traditional market niches outside test preparation 
essential to this strategy is the market alignment of the focused instruction and test preparation and assessment products so that both product lines are suitable for sale to an identical customer base 
we will continue to produce proprietary college preparation supplements and ancillary materials 
these products will not compete with any existing publisher agreements and will be crafted as supplements to help teachers and students with their college preparation studies 
our strategic growth plan calls for an emphasis on the internal development of products within the test preparation  assessment and instruction product lines 
under favorable circumstances  we would consider an acquisition to supplement our growth plan 
off balance sheet arrangements none seasonality the supplementary school publishing business is seasonal  cycling around the school year that runs from september through may 
typically  the major marketing campaigns  including mailings of new catalogs and focused sales efforts  begin in september when schools reopen 
this is the period when sample books are provided free of charge for review to teachers for their purchase consideration 
general marketing efforts  including additional sales and marketing campaigns  catalog mailings  and complimentary copies  continue throughout the school year 
teachers and districts generally review and consider books throughout the school year  make their decisions in the winter and spring  and place their purchase orders with the district office or other administrative units at that time 
during spring and summer  the district offices process purchase orders and send them to publishers 
each of our product lines has its own seasonality 
the average revenue percentage over the past two full fiscal years by quarter is summarized in the table below 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter ended ended ended ended august november february may test preparation  assessment and instruction college preparation total revenue the company has changed its fiscal year end from december to may this will more closely align our financial year end with our revenue cycle and our customers purchasing cycle

we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates under our entire line of credit and on million of our million term loan facility 
based on average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would have caused annual interest expense to change by approximately  we believe that these amounts are not material to our operations
