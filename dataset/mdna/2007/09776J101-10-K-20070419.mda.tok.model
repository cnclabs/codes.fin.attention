item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview the company was founded in and is one of the largest regional department store operators in terms of sales in the united states  offering a broad assortment of brand name fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
at february   we operated stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  elder beerman  herberger s and younkers nameplates and  under the parisian nameplate  stores in the detroit  michigan area  encompassing a total of approximately million square feet 
our management believes we hold the or market position among traditional department stores in most of the markets in which we operate 
the company had net sales of billion in effective march   we purchased all of the outstanding securities of two subsidiaries of saks that were solely related to the business of owning and operating retail department stores 
the stores are located in states in the midwest and upper great plains regions and operate under the names carson pirie scott  younkers  herberger s  boston store and bergner s 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid approximately billion in cash for carson s 
carson s stores encompass a total of approximately million square feet in mid size and metropolitan markets 
to finance the acquisition and the payoff of our previous revolving credit facility  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which provides for up to billion in borrowings  issued million in senior unsecured notes  and entered into a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on october   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with belk  inc belk  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase assets in connection with four department stores  all operated under the parisian nameplate and the rights to construct a new parisian store 
the purchase price was million in cash  subject to certain closing revisions 
in addition  we agreed to assume specific liabilities and obligations of belk and its affiliates with respect to the acquired parisian stores 
the acquisition of parisian was effective as of october  we achieved significant progress with the integration of bon ton and carson s operations in  completing scheduled phases of the systems integration and permitting a single management view of the consolidated operations 
in so doing  we substantially reduced our dependency on saks for transition services support 
our merchant and marketing staff successfully introduced a common merchandise assortment across all locations  including new private brand offerings  and implemented a common marketing advertising calendar in the second half of the private brand organization  established in milwaukee in  became an integral part of our merchandise organization 
we established and expanded the planning and allocation division to advance inventory productivity 
operational areas integrated in the first quarter of principally include the remaining aspects of internationally sourced merchandise purchasing and information systems technical support  effectively eliminating our dependency on saks for transition services support 
we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
the department store industry continues to evolve in response to ongoing consolidation among merchandise vendors as well as the evolution of competitive retail formats mass merchandisers  national chain retailers  specialty retailers and online retailers 
our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive  and we foresee competitive pressures and challenges continuing in the future 
as such  we anticipate minimal comparable store sales growth in  with a gross margin rate consistent with results 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes changes in our selected operating indicators  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each year presented components may not add or subtract to totals because of rounding percent of net sales net sales other income costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of lease related interests income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income compared to net sales net sales for increased to  million compared to  million in the prior year 
net sales include  million from carson s stores for the period march  through february  and parisian stores for the period october  through february  bon ton comparable store net sales for the fifty two week period ended january  decreased compared to the prior year fifty two week period 
we believe that the comparable store net sales decline was the result of several factors including  among others the introduction of a common merchandise assortment across all locations  which resulted in significant changes to the merchandise mix at the bon ton stores 
the implementation of a common marketing advertising calendar in the second half of  which resulted in less aggressive discounting in promotional activity at the bon ton stores

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise up to twelve months in advance of expected delivery 
these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies  insurance reserves  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is 
table of contents determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
prior to the carson s acquisition  we utilized the last in  first out lifo cost basis for all of our inventories 
in connection with the carson s acquisition  we evaluated the inventory costing for the acquired inventories and elected the first in  first out fifo cost basis for the majority of the acquired carson s locations 
as of february   approximately of our inventories were valued using a fifo cost basis and approximately of our inventories were valued using a lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations have yielded inventory increases in recent years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicate to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to a net realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of february  and january  inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are reflected as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
these allowances received from each vendor are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising or payroll costs that have been incurred and reflected in sg a expense 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent we do not believe recovery of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of income 

table of contents our net deferred tax assets were million and million at february  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we considered whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  or a portion thereof  will not be realized 
we considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
as a result  we concluded that a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
a total valuation allowance of million and million was recorded at february  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at february  and january   respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires the company to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions  if available 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  in we recorded million of asset impairment charges related to the reduction in the estimated net realizable value of a store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software resulting from the acquisition of carson s 
no impairment loss was recorded in and an impairment loss of million was recorded in depreciation and 
table of contents amortization expense in included in the impairment loss in is million related to the write down of an intangible asset at one store location 
goodwill and intangible assets our goodwill was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
the increase in goodwill reflects the purchase accounting for the acquisition of carson s 
net intangible assets totaled million and million at february  and january   respectively 
our intangible assets are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trademarks and customer lists 
the lease related interests and the portion of trademarks subject to amortization are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at february   lease related interests  customer lists and trademarks had average remaining lives of sixteen years  twelve years and two years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
trademarks of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives as part of the purchase accounting for carson s 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis methodology  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
for  we completed a review of the carrying value of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
purchase accounting we have accounted for the acquisition of carson s in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the purchase price paid to effect the acquisition was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date 
the acquisition of carson s was effective as of march  in connection with purchase price allocations  we made estimates of the fair values of our long lived and intangible assets based upon assumptions related to the future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives utilizing currently available information 
we have recorded preliminary purchase accounting adjustments to record the property and equipment and inventory at their estimated fair values  to establish intangible assets for trade names  customer lists and favorable lease interests and to revalue long term benefit plan obligations  among other things

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate facilities  we enter into derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps are used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps are qualifying hedges and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
at february   we held two variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million each 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and the interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at february  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflationary adjustments in the future
