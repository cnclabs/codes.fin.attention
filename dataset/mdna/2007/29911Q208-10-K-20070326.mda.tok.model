various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank  including state usury laws  laws relating to fiduciaries  consumer credit and equal credit  fair credit reporting  and privacy of non public financial information 
the bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w thereunder  which govern certain transactions  such as loans  extensions of credit  investments and purchases of assets between member banks and their affiliates  including their parent holding companies 
these restrictions limit the transfer from its subsidiaries  including the bank  of funds to the company in the form of loans  extensions of credit  investments or purchases of assets collectively  transfers  and they require that the bank s transactions with the company be on terms no less favorable to the bank than comparable transactions between the bank and unrelated third parties 
transfers by the bank to the company are limited in amount to of the bank s capital and surplus  and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to of the bank s capital and surplus 
furthermore  such loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements

the bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal stockholders or any related interest of such persons 
extensions of credit i must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and ii must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features

table of contents for assessments against institutions insured through the insurance fund which will be used to pay certain financing corporation fico obligations 
in addition to any insurance fund assessments  banks insured through the insurance fund are expected to make payments for the fico obligations based on eligible deposits each year 
the assessment is determined quarterly 
regulations promulgated by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of place limitations on the ability of certain insured depository institutions to accept  renew or rollover deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institutions normal market area 
under these regulations  well capitalized institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits without restriction  while adequately capitalized institutions may accept  renew or rollover such deposits with a waiver from the fdic subject to certain restrictions on payment of rates 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew or rollover such deposits

default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the federal regulators have adopted regulations and examination procedures promoting the safety and soundness of individual institutions by specifically addressing  among other things i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate exposure  v asset growth  vi ratio of classified assets to capital  vii minimum earnings  and viii compensation and benefits standards for management officials

failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the company or its subsidiaries  as well as officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties 
capital adequacy the frb  the fdic and the occ have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks under their supervision 
under these guidelines  the so called tier capital and total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet instruments must be at least and  respectively 
the frb  the fdic and the occ have also imposed a leverage standard to supplement their risk based ratios 
this leverage standard focuses on a banking institution s ratio of tier capital to average total assets  adjusted for goodwill and certain other items 
under these guidelines  banking institutions that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  along with those experiencing or anticipating significant growth  are expected to maintain a tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to at least 
as reflected in the following table  the risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized  the highest classification under the regulatory capital guidelines 

table of contents capital components and ratios at december  dollars in thousands company bank company bank capital components tier capital total risk based capital risk weighted assets and off balance sheet instruments risk based capital ratio tier capital total risk based capital leverage ratio the federal banking agencies  including the frb and the occ  maintain risk based capital standards in order to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of non traditional activities and equity investments in non financial companies  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on certain multifamily housing loans 
bank regulators periodically propose amendments to the risk based capital guidelines and related regulatory framework  and consider changes to the risk based capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet the requirements for the capital tiers described below 
while the company s management studies such proposals  the timing of adoption  ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments on the company s capital requirements and operations cannot be predicted 
the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements  fdicia established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier  or that of its bank holding company  depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including a risk based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
under the implementing regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies  a bank holding company or bank is considered well capitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for a capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank holding company or bank is defined as one that has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of 
a bank holding company or bank is considered a undercapitalized if it has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or in the case of a bank with a composite camels rating of  b significantly undercapitalized if the bank has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than  and c critically undercapitalized if the bank has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 
the frb may reclassify a well capitalized bank holding company or bank as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if it determines that the bank holding company or bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the bank holding company or bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency 
the company and the bank currently meet the definition of well capitalized institutions 
undercapitalized depository institutions  among other things  are subject to growth limitations  are prohibited  with certain exceptions  from making capital distributions  are limited in their ability to obtain funding from a federal reserve bank  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan and provide appropriate assurances of performance 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  including if the holding company refuses or is unable to make the guarantee described in the previous sentence  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
failure to submit or implement an acceptable capital plan also is grounds for the appointment of a conservator or a receiver 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of additional requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to 
table of contents become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
moreover  the parent holding company of a significantly undercapitalized depository institution may be ordered to divest itself of the institution or of non bank subsidiaries of the holding company 
critically undercapitalized institutions  among other things  are prohibited from making any payments of principal and interest on subordinated debt  and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
each federal banking agency prescribes standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares and other standards as they deem appropriate 
the frb and the occ have adopted such standards 
financial services modernization and other recent legislation the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home states  regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state 
the riegle neal act also permits interstate mergers of banks  with some limitations  and the establishment of new branches on an interstate basis  provided that such actions are authorized by the law of the host state 
the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate under a common holding company structure 
in addition to allowing new forms of financial services combinations  the glb act clarifies how financial services conglomerates will be regulated by the different federal and state regulators 
the glb act amended by the bhca and expanded the permissible activities of certain qualifying bank holding companies  known as financial holding companies 
in addition to engaging in banking and activities closely related to banking  as determined by the frb by regulation or order  financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
under the glb act  all financial institutions  including the company and the bank  are required to develop privacy policies  restrict the sharing of non public customer data with non affiliated parties at the customer s request  and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access 
usa patriot act the usa patriot act of the patriot act imposes additional obligations on us financial institutions  including banks and broker dealer subsidiaries  to implement policies  procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to prevent  detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism

monetary policy and economic control the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the frb 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks deposits 
table of contents and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb 
these monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans  investments and deposits  and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  and short term and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 
future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company cannot be predicted

item a 
risk factors the following factors identified by the company s management represent significant potential risks that the company faces in its operations 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans expose the company to increased lending risks 
at december   the company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of total gross loans and the company s portfolio of commercial business loans totaled million  or of total gross loans 
the company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans 
commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and business loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
also  many of the company s borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or commercial business loan outstanding with the company 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
continuing concentration of loans in the company s primary market area may increase the company s risk 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in western new york state 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in western new york state 
the company s business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small to medium sized businesses in this geographic region 
moreover  the company s assets are heavily concentrated in 
table of contents mortgages on properties located in western new york state 
accordingly  the company s business and operations are vulnerable to downturns in the economies of western new york state 
the concentration of the company s loans in this geographic region subjects the company to risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures  which would more greatly affect the company than if the company s lending were more geographically diversified 
in addition  the company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the company s mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
in the event the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the company s earnings could decrease 
the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses in order to mitigate the effect of possible losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
there is a risk that the company may experience significant loan and lease losses which could exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses the company has currently set aside 
in determining the amount of the company s allowance  the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan and lease portfolio  including the creditworthiness of its borrowers  the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans  the effects on the company s loan and lease portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  and the company s loan quality reviews 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review the company s loan and lease portfolio and credit underwriting procedures  as well as its allowance for loan and lease losses  and may require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs 
at december   the company had a net loan portfolio of approximately million and the allowance for loan and lease losses was approximately million  which represented of the total amount of gross loans and leases 
if the company s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the company to increase its provision for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan and lease charge offs  the company may have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses or loan and lease charge offs which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurances that the company s allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to protect the company against loan and lease losses that it may incur 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition may be significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities generally re price or mature more quickly than its interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in its net interest income 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of the company s interest earning assets  and in particular  the company s securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
at december   the company s securities available for sale totaled million 
net unrealized losses on securities available for sale  net of tax  amounted to million and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity or earnings 
the company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
strong competition within the company s market area may limit its growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally within the company s market area and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the company does  and may offer certain services that the company does not or cannot provide 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area 

table of contents the company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the company is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  frb  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors 
regulatory requirements affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank  the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan and lease losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  could have a material adverse impact on the bank  the company and its business  financial condition and results of operations
