table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties 
our domestic areas of operation include the onshore gulf coast  the anadarko and arkoma basins of the mid continent  the uinta basin of the rocky mountains and the gulf of mexico 
internationally  we are active offshore malaysia and china and in the uk north sea 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production as a part of our risk management program 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
reserve replacement 
most of our producing properties have declining production rates 
as a result  to maintain and grow our production and cash flow we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant estimates 
we believe the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  the timing of future drilling  development and abandonment activities  the cost of these activities in the future  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  the value of our derivative positions  and the fair value of stock based compensation 
accounting for hedging activities 
beginning october   we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates commodity derivative activities 
results of operations revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production  which includes the effects of the settlement of derivative contracts associated with our production that are accounted for as hedges 
settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges has no effect on our reported revenues 
please see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
revenues of billion for were lower than revenues due to lower gas prices and lower oil production partially offset by higher oil prices and increased gas production

without the effects of hedging contracts  our average realized prices for  and would have been  and per mcf  respectively  for gas and  and per barrel  respectively  for oil 
production 
our total oil and gas production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis was essentially the same as total production for successful drilling efforts in the mid continent were offset by continued gulf of mexico production deferrals of approximately bcfe during related to hurricanes katrina and rita in  natural field declines and the timing of liftings of oil production in malaysia 
our total oil and gas production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis decreased from the 
table of contents decrease was a result of gulf of mexico production deferrals of approximately bcfe related to the storms offset by a full year s production from our acquisitions and successful drilling efforts 
natural gas 
our natural gas production increased over the increase was primarily the result of successful drilling efforts in the mid continent partially offset by continued gulf of mexico production deferrals during the first half of related to the storms and natural field declines 
our natural gas production decreased when compared to the decrease was the result of production deferrals related to the storms and natural field declines offset by a full year s production from our acquisitions 
crude oil and condensate 
our oil and condensate production decreased primarily as a result of the timing of liftings of oil production in malaysia 
our oil and condensate production increased when compared to primarily due to a full year s production from the inland resources acquisition and a full year of liftings in malaysia partially offset by production deferrals related to the storms 
operating expenses 
generally  our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding 
as a result  our operating expenses also have increased 
we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production  or per mcfe  basis 

table of contents year ended december  compared to december  the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december  unit of production amount year ended percentage year ended percentage december  increase december  increase decrease decrease per mcfe in millions united states lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative other total operating expenses international lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test writedown total operating expenses total lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test writedown other total operating expenses domestic operations 
our domestic operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the same period of this increase was primarily related to the following items lease operating expense loe increased due to higher operating costs for all of our operations and significantly higher insurance costs for our gulf of mexico operations 
additionally  loe was impacted by the difference per mcfe between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of all claims related to the hurricanes and actual repair expenditures during without the impact of the costs related to the repairs for the storms in excess of our insured amount  our loe would have been per mcfe for production and other taxes decreased primarily due to refunds related to production tax exemptions on certain of our onshore high cost gas wells in texas 
the increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions 
the cost of reserve additions was adversely impacted by escalating costs of drilling goods and services experienced during the component of dd a associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was per mcfe for and please see 
table of contents note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative g a expense increased approximately per mcfe primarily due to stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on january  please see note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase attributable to stock based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense as a result of lower adjusted net income as defined in our incentive compensation plan in as compared to the prior year 
adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
during  we capitalized million of direct internal costs as compared to million in other expenses for and include the following items in  we redeemed all million of our senior subordinated notes due we recorded a charge for the million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs related to the notes 
in addition  we recorded a million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage in relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the storms 
in  we recorded a million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage and sold our interest in the floating production system and related equipment we acquired in the eex transaction for a net gain of million 
international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the increase was primarily related to the following items loe increased because our production in malaysia decreased while total loe remained relatively unchanged 
our malaysian loe primarily consists of fixed costs related to our fpso 
production and other taxes increased as a result of higher crude oil prices 
dd a increased as a result of higher cost reserve additions in malaysia and initial liftings of oil production in china during the third quarter of g a expense increased due to stock compensation expense recognized as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  and growth in our international workforce 
we recorded a ceiling test writedown of million associated with ceasing our exploration efforts in brazil in in  we recorded a ceiling test writedown of million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in brazil and in other non core international regions

our domestic operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the same period of this increase was primarily related to the following items loe was adversely impacted by deferred production of approximately bcfe related to the storms  higher operating costs  increased well workover activity and natural field declines in our gulf of mexico properties 
production and other taxes increased due to higher commodity prices and an increase in the proportion of our production volumes subject to production taxes as a result of our acquisition of the monument butte field  increased production from our mid continent and onshore gulf coast operations and storm related deferrals in the gulf of mexico 
the increase in our dd a rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions 
the component of dd a associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was per mcfe and per mcfe for and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in g a expense was primarily due to growth in our workforce as a result of acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation as a result of higher adjusted net income as defined in our incentive compensation plan in as compared to the prior year 
adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
during  we capitalized million of direct internal costs as compared to million in other expenses for and include the following items in december  we recorded a million benefit related to our business interruption insurance coverage as a result of the disruptions in our operations caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
as a result of our acquisition of eex corporation in november  we owned a interest in a floating production system  some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water 
at the time of acquisition  we estimated the fair value of these assets to be million 
since their acquisition  we had undertaken to sell these assets 
in december  when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized  we determined that there was no active market for these assets 
as a result  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million 
in early april  we entered into an agreement with diamond offshore services company to sell our interest in the floating production facility and related equipment 
in august  we closed the sale and received net proceeds of million  which were recorded as a gain on our consolidated statement of income 
international operations 
in may  we entered into pscs with malaysia s state owned oil company with respect to two offshore blocks 
liftings of oil production began in august prior thereto  our producing international operations consisted of one field in the uk north sea  which we sold in june the increase in loe primarily resulted from a full year of operations in malaysia in production and other taxes increased due to the significant increase in oil prices during a ceiling test writedown of million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in brazil and in other non core international regions was recorded in december in  we recorded a ceiling test writedown of million associated with a dry hole in the uk north sea 
interest expense 
the following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in millions gross interest expense capitalized interest net interest expense the increase in gross interest expense in resulted primarily from the april  issuance of million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  partially offset by the may  redemption of million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the increase is primarily due to an entire year of accrued interest related to our senior subordinated notes due issued in august in connection with our acquisition of the monument butte field 
during the second half of  we financed the cash consideration for our acquisitions of properties in oklahoma and the gulf of mexico aggregating approximately million primarily with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
by the end of the second quarter of  we had repaid all of the borrowings under our credit arrangements for the acquisitions 

table of contents we capitalize interest with respect to unproved properties 
interest capitalized increased in over primarily due to an increase in our unproved property base as a result of the inland resources acquisition in late august commodity derivative income expense 
the following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative income expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in millions cash flow hedges hedge ineffectiveness other derivative contracts realized loss on settlement of discontinued cash flow hedges unrealized gain loss due to changes in fair market value realized gain loss on settlement total commodity derivative income expense hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result of the production deferrals experienced in the gulf of mexico related to hurricanes katrina and rita  hedge accounting was discontinued during the third quarter of on a portion of our contracts that had previously qualified as effective cash flow hedges of our gulf of mexico production and other contracts were redesignated as hedges of our onshore gulf coast production 
as a result  realized losses of million associated with derivative contracts for the third and fourth quarters of  which were in excess of hedged physical deliveries for those periods  were reported as commodity derivative expense 
the unrealized gain loss due to changes in fair market value is associated with our derivative contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting and represents changes in the fair value of these open contracts during the period 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was more than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to state income taxes and the excess of the malaysia and uk statutory tax rates over the uk federal statutory rate 
in addition  our effective tax rate for increased as a result of an million million uk and million brazilian valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards in those countries that are not expected to be realized 
the million uk valuation allowance is due to a substantial decrease in estimated future taxable income as a result of the disappointing results of the recent well in our grove field in the uk north sea 
our effective tax rate for the year was less than our effective tax rate for primarily due to the realization of a net change of million in our valuation allowance for tax assets related to certain of our international operations 
an million valuation allowance related to our uk net operating loss carryforwards was reversed in as a result of a substantial increase in estimated future taxable income as a result of our grove discovery in the uk north sea 
in  we recorded a million valuation allowance for various international and brazilian deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards that were not expected to be realized 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  the timing and amount of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow 
we accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
over the long term  we have successfully grown our reserve base and production  resulting in growth in our net cash flows from operating activities 
fluctuations in commodity 
table of contents prices and the hurricanes have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities 
in august  we reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle all claims related to hurricanes katrina and rita business interruption  property damage and control of well operator s extra expense for million 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year based in part on expected cash flow from operations for that year 
in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
because of the nature of the properties we own  contractual capital commitments beyond are not significant 
our capital budget exceeds currently expected cash flow from operations by approximately million 
we anticipate that the shortfall will be made up with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
on october   our senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million become due 
we currently plan to fund the repayment with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
credit arrangements 
in december  we entered into a revolving credit facility that matures in december our credit facility provides for initial loan commitments of billion from a syndication of participating banks  led by jpmorgan chase as the agent bank 
the loan commitments may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of billion if the current lenders increase their loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the credit facility 
loans under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  based on a a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions during the last preceding business day plus basis points or b a base eurodollar rate  substantially equal to the london interbank offered rate  plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating basis points per annum at december  
at february   we had no outstanding borrowings and million of undrawn letters of credit under our credit facility 
the credit facility has restrictive covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed to  maintenance of a ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  exploration and abandonment expense and other noncash charges and expenses to consolidated interest expense of at least to  and  as long as our debt rating is below investment grade  the maintenance of an annual ratio of the net present value of our oil and gas properties to total debt of at least to 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we also have a total of million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various banks 
at february   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our money market lines 
as of february   we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements 
generally  we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  this compares to working capital deficits of million at the end of and million at the end of the majority of the working capital deficit at december  relates to the reclassification of our million senior notes due october  as a current liability and an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of our significant capital activities towards the end of the increase in accrued liabilities is due to our increased exploration and development activity and higher service costs over our working capital balances are also affected by fluctuations in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
at december   the fair value of our short term derivatives was a net asset of million 
at december   this amount was a net short term derivative liability of million 
at december   the fair value of our short term derivatives was a net asset of million see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital deficit also includes million in asset retirement obligations compared to million 
table of contents in and million in see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts 
our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts 
however  we enter into commodity hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  to help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and to manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by dd a  writedowns or other non cash charges or credits 
our net cash flow from operations was  million in  a increase over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to realized oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis  including the effects of hedging contracts regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting  which increased over see results of operations above 
our net cash flows from operations were  million in  an increase over the prior year 
although our production volumes were impacted by the storms  higher commodity prices offset the cash flow impact of the deferred production 
realized oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis  including the effects of hedging contracts regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting  increased over see results of operations above 
capital expenditures 
our capital spending was  million  a increase from our capital spending of  million 
these amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of million in and million in during  we invested  million in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in other domestic leasehold activity and million internationally 
our capital spending was  million  a decrease from our capital spending of  million excluding recorded asset retirement obligations of million 
during  we invested million in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in other domestic leasehold activity and million internationally 
we budgeted billion for capital spending in  excluding acquisitions 
this total includes million for continuing hurricane repairs in the gulf of mexico and excludes million for capitalized interest and overhead 
approximately of the billion is allocated to the gulf of mexico including the traditional shelf  the deep and ultra deep shelf and deepwater  to the onshore gulf coast  to the mid continent  to the rocky mountains and to international projects 
see item  business plans for since our capital budget exceeds currently forecasted cash flow  we plan to make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including the extent to which proved properties are acquired  drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services 
we continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
historically  with the exception of  we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year 
depending on the timing of an acquisition  we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows provided by financing activities for were million compared to million of net cash flows used in financing activities for in october  our million principal amount senior notes will become due 
we currently anticipate repaying these notes with borrowings under our credit arrangements

oil and gas activities 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
we have work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other cash commitments 
at december   these work related commitments total million and are comprised of million in the united states and million internationally 
these amounts are not included by maturity because their timing cannot be accurately predicted

table of contents senior notes 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually 
our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations 
we may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur debt secured by certain liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and enter into merger or consolidation transactions 
the indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future  then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note  debt interest rate swaps  to our consolidated financial statements 
senior subordinated notes 
in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness 
we may redeem some or all of our notes due at any time on or after september  and some or all of our notes due at any time on or after april   in each case  at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes 
we also may redeem all but not part of our notes due prior to september  and all but not part of our notes due prior to april   in each case  at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in addition  before september   we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of our notes due with the net cash proceeds from certain sales of our common stock at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
likewise  before april   we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of our notes due with similar net cash proceeds at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  make restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  create liens  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
commitments under joint operating agreements 
most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement 
table of contents enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
oil and gas hedging we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
approximately of our production was subject to derivative contracts including both contracts that are designated and not designated for hedge accounting 
in  of our production was subject to derivative contracts  compared to in while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
historically  all of our hedged natural gas and crude oil production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges 
therefore  we believe that our hedged production is not subject to material basis risk 
the price that we receive for natural gas production from the gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically averages less per mmbtu than the henry hub index 
realized gas prices for our mid continent properties  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically average less per mmbtu than the henry hub index 
the price we receive for our gulf coast oil production typically averages about per barrel below the nymex west texas intermediate wti price 
the price we receive for our oil production in the rocky mountains is currently averaging about per barrel below the wti price 
oil production from the mid continent typically sells at a per barrel discount to wti 
oil production from our operations in malaysia typically sells at tapis  or about even with wti 
oil sales from our operations in china are currently averaging about per barrel less than the wti 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
at december   bank of montreal  jpmorgan chase  citibank  na and j aron company were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production 
please see the discussion and tables in note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of december  and the fair value of those contracts as of that date

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under contractual obligations oil and gas activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions 
stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards  the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgements 
oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating 
table of contents quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
as a requirement of our revolving credit facility  independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least of the present value of our proved reserves 
for december   the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing of our proved reserves and of the present value 
for such properties  the reserves reported by the independent reserve engineers were within of the reserves we reported 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for would require a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at december  of approximately bcfe 
due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools for the uk  malaysia and china  any decrease in reserves associated with the respective country s full cost pool would significantly increase the dd a rate in that country 
however  since production from our international operations represented less than of our consolidated production for  a change in our international dd a expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
however  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting 
given the fluctuation of natural gas and oil prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
at december   the ceiling value of our domestic oil and gas reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mmbtu for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
using these prices  the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties would have exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately million net of tax at december  however  on february   the market price for gas gas daily henry hub increased to per mmbtu and the market price for oil platt s wti at cushing decreased to per barrel 
utilizing these prices  the unamortized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties would not have exceeded the ceiling amount at december  as a result  we did not record a writedown in the fourth quarter of the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in the us using the february  prices exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately million 

table of contents at december   the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in malaysia  the uk and china exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to the relatively small size of these international pools  holding all other factors constant  if the applicable index for natural gas prices were to decline to approximately per mcf and or oil prices were to decline to approximately per bbl  it is possible that we could experience ceiling test writedowns in one or all of these international areas 
costs withheld from amortization 
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   our domestic full cost pool had approximately million of costs excluded from the amortization base  including million associated with development costs for our deepwater gulf of mexico project known as glider  located at green canyon at december   capital costs not subject to amortization include million related to our acquisition of the monument butte field 
due to the significant size of the field  evaluation of the entire amount will require a number of years 
because the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  before considering the natural gas price increases experienced subsequent to year end resulted in an excess of the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties over the cost center ceiling  inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base would have further increased the excess of the carrying value over the cost center ceiling 
utilizing commodity prices in effect as of february   the inclusion of some or all of these unevaluated property costs in our amortization base  without adding any associated reserves  would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
however  our future dd a rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis 

table of contents the accounting for future abandonment costs is set forth by sfas no 
this standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future abandonment and development costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future abandonment and development costs at december  of approximately million 
due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the uk  malaysia and china  any change in future abandonment or development costs associated with the respective country s full cost pool would significantly change the dd a rate in that country 
however  since production from our international operations represented less than of our consolidated production for  a change in our international dd a expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations as part of our growth strategy  we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 
goodwill of each reporting unit each country is a separate reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in making this assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated cash flows 
as there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
if it is overstated  such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
we elected to make december our annual assessment date 
commodity derivative activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next months 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
under accounting rules  we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production 
to the extent that changes in the fair values of the cash flow hedges offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production  such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
to the extent that changes in the fair values of the derivative exceed the changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production  the changes are recorded in income in the period in which they occur 
derivatives that do not qualify such as three way collar contracts see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements or have not been designated as 
table of contents cash flow hedges for hedge accounting are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the changes occur 
beginning on october   we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for cash flow hedges  we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location 
where necessary  we adjust nymex prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent  third party quotations 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r to account for stock based compensation 
under this method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
we elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and other equity based compensation beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
the determination of the fair value of an award requires significant estimates and subjective judgments regarding  among other things  the appropriate option pricing model  the expected life of the award and performance vesting criteria assumptions 
as there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the fair value determinations  there is risk that the recorded stock compensation may not accurately reflect the amount ultimately earned by the employee 
for years prior to  we accounted for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we recognized compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
please see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standard in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
these amounts are subsequently reevalvated and changes are recognized as adjustments to current period tax expense 
fin also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits 
we are required to adopt fin on january  upon adoption  we will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions and any cumulative effect adjustment will be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of fin and determined that its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
an overview of this regulation is set forth below 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
please see the discussion under the caption we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business in item a of this report 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  congress could  however  reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
from to the present  several major regulatory changes have been implemented by congress and the ferc that affect the economics of natural gas production  transportation and sales 
in addition  the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies  that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation 
the ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the ferc since cannot be predicted 
in addition  some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and ferc final decisions 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters 
some of the ferc s more recent proposals may  however  adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access  non discriminatory service 
there are currently no regulations implemented by the ferc under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
therefore  we do not believe that any ferc or mms action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
on august   president bush signed into law the energy policy act of epa 
this comprehensive act contains many provisions that will encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the us the epa directs the ferc  mms and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the epa 
we believe that neither the epa nor the regulations promulgated  or to be promulgated  as a result of the epa will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products 
table of contents are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other crude oil and condensate producers 
federal leases 
most of our oil and gas leases in utah and the gulf of mexico are granted by the federal government and administered by the mms or the blm  both federal agencies 
mms and blm leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm or mms regulations and  in the case of offshore leases  orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling  and comply with regulations governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of wells on the shelf and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the blm or the mms  as applicable  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
the epa formalizes the royalty in kind program of the mms  providing that the mms may take royalties in kind if the secretary of the interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value 
we believe that the mms royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in  the mms amended its regulations to require additional filing fees 
the mms has estimated that these additional filing fees will represent less than of the revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases 
we do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore in louisiana  texas  new mexico  oklahoma and utah 
we also own interests in properties in state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials  the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the cost of compliance could be significant 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations  or the issuance of injunctive relief including orders to cease operations 
environmental laws and 
table of contents regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we also are subject to various environmental permit requirements 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
moreover  some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability  which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns strict  joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires operators in the gulf of mexico to demonstrate to the mms that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
under opa and implementing mms regulations  responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least million for an oil spill in state waters and at least million for an oil spill in federal waters 
since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters  we currently provide a total of million in financial assurance to mms 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
the cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with the cwa  including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
the opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention  control and countermeasure or spcc plans 
we have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or  as necessary  developing new spcc plans that will satisfy new spcc plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in july ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  the us environmental protection agency  also known as the epa and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous 
table of contents substance into the environment 
such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws and common law obligations  and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties  including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
the clean air act caa and comparable state statutes restricts the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations 
new facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
also  the epa has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants 
these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 
the occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
the osha hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees 
other osha standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations 
failure to comply with osha requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties 
international regulations 
our exploration and production operations outside the united states are subject to various types of regulations similar to those described above imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate  and may affect our operations and costs within that country 
we currently have operations in malaysia  china and the united kingdom 
forward looking information this report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures  the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves  wells planned to be drilled in the future  our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable  this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties 
actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  well and waterflood performance  severe weather conditions such as hurricanes  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services  the availability of capital resources  and the other factors affecting our business described above under the caption risk factors 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors

an agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage 
generally  the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage 
the assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease 
the interest received by an assignee is a farm in  while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption oil and gas hedging in item of this report and note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rates at december   our current and long term debt was comprised of fixed variable rate debt rate debt in millions bank revolving credit facility senior notes due senior notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due total current and long term debt million principal amount of our senior notes due and million principal amount of our senior notes due are subject to interest rate swaps 
these swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments  and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
classified as current debt on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because as of december  about of our long term debt obligations  after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements  were at fixed rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be less than million 
foreign currency exchange rates the british pound is the functional currency for our operations in the united kingdom 
the functional currency for all other foreign operations is the us dollar 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
