item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond the company s control 
these include  among other factors  general business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  the attainment of design wins and obtaining orders as a result  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to goodwill  investments and foreign regulations 
in addition  during weak and uncertain economic periods  customer visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
it is believed that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below o revenue recognition o software development costs o valuation of inventories o income taxes o product warranty o carrying value of goodwill o stock based compensation o restructuring costs revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfied 
revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  revenue recognition is deferred and revenue will be recognized when all obligations under the arrangement are fulfilled 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the accounting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
product warranty warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of certain products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
carrying value of goodwill tests for impairments of goodwill are conducted annually  at year end  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because these impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the goodwill s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
stock based compensation stock options are granted to purchase our common stock 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment  stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 
restructuring costs restructuring costs consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified or  if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimates depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
overview the following contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of and securities exchange act of and these forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company is a global supplier of integrated ip based platforms and solutions for advanced communications networks and innovative computer system architectures 
ip  short for internet protocol  is a widely adopted method under which information is encapsulated into packets and transferred over a computer network 
such computer networks can range from very short  efficient connections between elements within a single computer system to that of two or more computer systems on different sides of the world and communicating over the internet 
the company targets three vertical markets telecommunications  defense and homeland security  and commercial 
of the three vertical markets served  telecommunications is the largest and represents approximately of the company s business 
an approximate breakdown of telecommunications applications utilizing the company s products is as follows voice over ip voip represents  wireless infrastructure represents  and the remaining is spread across ip multimedia and other applications 
the company s products are marketed through a direct worldwide sales force under a variety of brand names including advanced managed platforms tm  nexusware tm and segway tm 
these products are based on open standards and are sold as fully integrated  purpose built  application ready platforms  or as individual blade components for the embedded communications marketplace 
a key differentiation of the company s products is the internally developed software available with each product 
when sold as platforms  known as our advanced managed platform products  our customers can quickly move to the enhanced value steps of their products while realizing distinct cost advantages  increased overall system reliability and performance  and improved time to market 
since its introduction in  our advanced managed platform product line has realized more than new design wins 
if successfully implemented by our customers  each design win has the potential to generate greater than 
million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
in addition  we also realized more than new design wins for blade solutions in this same time period 
design wins are subject to risks and uncertainties and  therefore  not all design wins have or are expected to result in production orders 
the telecommunications market served by the company depends upon carrier spending to upgrade network infrastructure to next generation equipment 
was a challenging year for equipment manufacturers serving this market 
in particular  investments by us wireless carriers in next generation mobile networks were very selective throughout much of the year 
this occurrence adversely impacted the company  its customers and competitors 
in the european region  telecommunications continued to demonstrate growth 
during  our shipments to european customers continued to expand 
based on our ip network focus  europe is expected to continue to represent important market opportunity for our products 
during  we balanced our traditional engineering and technology focus with a stronger emphasis on sales and marketing 
in this endeavor  our sales organization was expanded  a new sales plan was instituted  more experienced sales people were hired and new sales leadership was put in place 
we believe the revitalization of the sales organization was a key accomplishment in at the same time  we recognized the need to balance investments in sales and marketing with projected revenue levels 
since the beginning of  we instituted a number of expense reduction initiatives including closing our norwood engineering facility  relocating our san luis obispo engineering center to a less expensive facility and implementing reductions in force 
in october  michael p 
skarzynski resigned as president  chief executive officer and as a member of the board of directors 
the company s current chairman  john m 
slusser became interim president and chief executive officer following mr 
skarzynski s resignation 
in january  mr 
slusser was appointed the permanent president and chief executive officer 
industry overview industry market research organizations are estimating the worldwide embedded systems market amounted to billion in size in  roughly the same size as in traditionally  the largest segment of this market has used proprietary  purpose built embedded systems and products 
embedded systems built on open standards comprise approximately  or billion of this market 
while proprietary systems are expected to continue to dominate this market  presently  we believe a growing share of embedded systems being implemented  especially in the more limited markets served by the company  is expected to use open standards based products 
relying on standards based development partners  such as the company  allows customers to meet the competitive pressures of time to market found in most technology businesses 
this also allows these suppliers to concentrate their efforts and expertise on their value add applications and services  which typically includes software and additional hardware elements directed toward specific applications 
our customers are primarily equipment manufacturers in the telecommunications  data communications  defense and homeland security and commercial markets 
our largest customer base is the equipment manufacturers serving the telecommunications market  and shipments to these customers declined in these customers depend upon carrier spending to upgrade network infrastructure to next generation equipment 
domestic carrier spending during did not meet market expectations 
in the european region  telecommunications continued to demonstrate important growth 
during  shipments to european customers continued to expand 
based on our ip network focus  europe is expected to continue to represent an important market opportunity for our products 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  economic environment and the company s initiatives for strategy the company supplies embedded  standards based products and solutions to customers serving the telecommunications  defense and homeland security  and commercial markets 
today these products and solutions are typically integrated combinations of computer systems hardware and software elements which the company refers to as advanced managed platforms 
these platforms offer significant customer advantages that include reduced time to market  enhanced cost versus performance metrics  high availability  etc 
during its year history  the company has introduced numerous innovations to the embedded systems market and has successfully evolved with the substantial technological advancements during that period to remain on the leading edge of solutions in the markets it serves 
the company repositioned its product strategy in to deliver fully managed  integrated ip based platforms to the embedded communications marketplace 
this positioning enabled the company to address more than of the served available market 
today  our line of integrated ip based platforms and solutions specifically addresses equipment manufacturers requirements for an increased level of system integration and services from suppliers  thus allowing them to focus on their value added stages of product development  which in most cases is application software 
this strategy also enables our customers to replace proprietary or legacy platforms with the latest generation of platform products 
there are identifiable risks associated with carrying out the company s strategy in the current economic climate 
some of the company s end markets are not expected to grow in in order to improve profitability in this environment  the company will have to be more innovative and aggressive 
management believes that based on its analysis of the marketplace and the strength of the company s product and technology portfolio  the identified risks are manageable 
if successful  management believes its initiatives can yield improved profitability  particularly if the business cycle starts to show improvement 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicators the company works closely with customers to incorporate its platforms  blades and software solutions into their product designs 
such design wins have been a useful metric for management to judge the company s product acceptance in its marketplace 
design wins  if successfully implemented by our customers  reach production volumes at varying rates  generally beginning twelve to eighteen months after the design win occurs 
a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations  changes in customer markets and economic conditions can adversely affect a design win before production is reached or during deployment 
in  the company began targeting design wins with major accounts 
this approach may lower the total number of design wins reported in the future although management expects such design wins to generate higher  long term value if they are implemented 
during  we realized ten design wins for our advanced managed platform with multiple products  and individual communications products  segway products  and switch products 
during  the company realized design wins comprised of advanced managed platform with multiple products  and individual communications products and switch products 
each design win has the potential to generate at least 
million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
not all design wins are expected to result in production orders 
we believe that another key indicator for our business is the volume of orders received from our customers 
during weak or uncertain economic periods  visibility of customer orders is limited  which frequently causes delays in the placement of orders with the company 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
forward looking visibility of customer orders continues to be very limited 
shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in this decrease in revenue was attributable to lower shipments into the telecommunications market  including the company s largest customer  lucent technologies  inc shipments to lucent declined by million  to million in due to a decrease in demand from lucent customers
