bank regulation as a new jersey chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to the regulation  supervision  and control of the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
as an fdic insured institution  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision and control of the fdic  an agency of the federal government 
the regulations of the fdic and the new jersey department of banking and insurance impact virtually all of the bank s activities  including the minimum level of capital we must maintain  our ability to pay dividends  our ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters 
insurance of deposits the bank s deposits are insured up to a maximum of  per depositor  per ira account under the deposit insurance fund of the fdic 
the fdic has established a risk based assessment system for all insured depository institutions 
under the risk based assessment system  deposit insurance premium rates during ranged from basis points of assessed deposits 
for the year ended december   we paid deposit insurance premiums of  commencing in january  the fdic revised its deposit insurance assessment system 
under the new system  deposit insurance assessment rates will range from to basis points of assessed deposits 
capital adequacy guidelines the fdic has promulgated risk based capital guidelines  which are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under these guidelines  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
these guidelines are substantially similar to the federal reserve board guidelines discussed above 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the fdic has adopted a minimum tier capital leverage ratio 
this measurement is substantially similar to the federal reserve leverage capital measurement discussed above 
dividends as long as the operations of the bank remain our primary source of income  our ability to pay dividends will be effected by any legal or regulatory limitations on the bank s ability to pay dividends to us 
the bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds legally available  subject to certain restrictions 
under the new jersey banking act of  the bank may not pay a cash dividend unless  following the payment  the bank s capital stock will be unimpaired and the bank will have a surplus of no less than of the bank s capital stock or  if not  the payment of the dividend will not reduce the surplus 
in addition  the bank cannot pay dividends in such amounts as would reduce the bank s capital below regulatory imposed minimums 
during  we commenced paying quarterly cash dividends of per share and increased the dividend in to per share 
the board will review the amount and frequency of the company s cash dividends on an ongoing basis  based upon the company s results of operations  capital needs and other appropriate factors

item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations and the trading prices of our securities can be materially and adversely affected by many events and conditions including the following risks affecting our business our continued growth may negatively affect profitability 
our asset size has grown each year we have been in existence 
since december   we have grown by more than percent 
our business plan calls for our continued expansion 
we project opening two new branches in the next twelve months 
this growth could negatively impact our future profitability in several ways  including through potential loan losses and the need for future provisions to the loan loss reserve  and an increase in operating and other non interest expenses associated with growth 
our continued growth and success also depends on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage our growth effectively  to attract and retain skilled employees and to expand the capabilities of our management information systems 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our expansion and the failure to do so would adversely affect our financial position 
our future success may be dependent upon our chief executive officer 
our future success in implementing our current business strategy is dependent on the continued services of stewart e 
mcclure  jr  our president  chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
if mr 
mcclure were to become unavailable for any reason  our operations would likely suffer 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
mcclure  no assurances can be given that we will continue to benefit from mr 
mcclure s ongoing involvement in our operations 
defensive measures contained in the certificate of incorporation limit the ability of shareholders to exert control over the board of directors 
our board may consider issues other than price in evaluating offers 
our certificate of incorporation contains certain provisions which have been adopted to permit the board to act in the best interests of all shareholders in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid 
these provisions may also have significant effects in limiting the ability of our shareholders to effect an immediate change in the composition of the board of directors and to otherwise exercise their voting power to affect the composition of the board or to accept an offer that the shareholders may consider to be in their best interests but which the board does not accept 
in general  these provisions provide i for a classified board of directors  ii that directors may not be removed by shareholders without cause  iii that the affirmative vote of of the outstanding shares of common stock are required to approve a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of the company s assets  unless the proposed transaction is approved by a majority of the board of directors  and iv prior notice of any shareholder nominations and proposals 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation provides that when the board of directors evaluates a tender or exchange offer for our securities  a proposal to merge or consolidate with another entity  or a proposal to have all or substantially all of our property and assets acquired by another entity  the board may  as permitted by new jersey law  give due consideration to all facts that it deems relevant in evaluating what is in the best interests of the company  the bank and the shareholders 
risks related to the banking industry the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
in addition  a flat yield curve  in which short term deposit and borrowing rates equal longer term investment or loan rates  could adversely impact net interest income as the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities compresses 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in local economic conditions could adversely affect our loan portfolio 
our success depends to a great extent upon the general economic conditions of the local markets that we serve 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in our northern and central new jersey markets  so any decline in the economy of new jersey could have an adverse impact on us 
our loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of collateral securing these loans  are impacted by economic conditions 
our financial results  the credit quality of our existing loan portfolio  and the ability to generate new loans with acceptable yield and credit characteristics may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including declines in real estate values  changes in interest rates  adverse employment conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
although economic conditions in our primary market area are strong and have aided our recent growth  we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue to prevail 
there is a risk that we may not be repaid in a timely manner  or at all  for loans we make 
the risk of nonpayment or deferred or delayed payment of loans is inherent in commercial banking 
such non payment  or delayed or deferred payment of loans to the company  if they occur  may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition 
additionally  in compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses created through charges against earnings 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was million 
the company s marketing focus on small to medium size businesses may result in the assumption by the company of certain lending risks that are different from or greater than those which would apply to loans made to larger companies 
we seek to minimize our credit risk exposure through credit controls  which include evaluation of potential borrowers  available collateral  liquidity and cash flow 
however  there can be no assurance that such procedures will actually reduce loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect results of our operations 
risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by management  and periodically  by an independent loan review function and by the audit committee 
a risk system  consisting of multiple grading categories  is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and the appropriate level of loss reserves 
along with the risk system  management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrowers  past and expected loan loss experience  and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an adequate reserve 
this risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are realized in the periods in which they become known 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
state and federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses  we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
either of these occurrences could adversely affect our earnings 
we are in competition with many other banks  including larger commercial banks which have greater resources than us 
the banking industry within the state of new jersey is highly competitive 
the company s principal market area is also served by branch offices of large commercial banks and thrift institutions 
in addition  in the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of was passed into law 
the modernization act permits other financial entities  such as insurance companies and securities firms  to acquire or form financial institutions  thereby further increasing competition 
a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to expend upon advertising and marketing  and their substantially greater capitalization enables them to make much larger loans 
our success depends a great deal upon our judgment that large and mid size financial institutions do not adequately serve small businesses in our principal market area and our ability to compete favorably for such customers 
in addition to competition from larger institutions  we also face competition for individuals and small businesses from recently formed banks seeking to compete as home town institutions 
most of these new institutions have focused their marketing efforts on the smaller end of the small business market we serve 
the laws that regulate our operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public  but not our stockholders 
the federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our operations give regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement responsibilities  and generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the deposit insurance funds and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders 
these laws and regulations can materially affect our future business 
laws and regulations now affecting us may be changed at any time  and the interpretation of such laws and regulations by bank regulatory authorities is also subject to change 
we can give no assurance that future changes in laws and regulations or changes in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to higher operating costs as a result of government regulation 
we are subject to extensive federal and state legislation  regulation and supervision which is intended primarily to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance company s deposit insurance fund  rather than investors 
in addition  as a publicly traded company  we are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission sec 
in recent years  new legislation such as the sarbanes oxley act of and regulation adopted by the sec thereunder have greatly increased compliance costs and burdens on publicly traded companies 
future legislative and regulatory changes may further increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for competitors 
we cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business 
the financial services market  including banking services  is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications  data processing  automation  internet based banking  telebanking  and debit cards and so called smart cards 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes 
to develop these and other new technologies we will likely have to make additional capital investments 
although we continually invest in new technology  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

we based the forward looking statements on various factors and using numerous assumptions 
important factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by forward looking statements including those discussed under item a risk factors and the following factor for example the success or failure of our efforts to implement our business strategy  the effect of changing economic conditions and in particular changes in interest rates  changes in government regulations  tax rates and similar matters  our ability to attract and retain quality employees  and other risks which may be described in our future filings with the sec

management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
when necessary  reclassifications have been made to prior years data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgement and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
overview and strategy the company serves as a holding company for the bank  which is its primary asset and only operating subsidiary 
the bank conducts a traditional banking business  making commercial loans  consumer loans  and residential and commercial real estate loans 
in addition  the bank offers various non deposit products through non proprietary relationships with third party vendors 
the bank relies primarily upon deposits as the funding source for its assets 
the bank offers traditional deposit products 
in addition  as an alternative to traditional certificate of deposit accounts  the bank offers its paramount checking account  an interest paying checking account which also provides a suite of additional services  such as free checks  free telephone banking and free bill payment  free safe deposit box and refunds for foreign atm fees 
although the rate the bank pays on the paramount checking account is higher than the rate offered on most interest paying checking accounts by the bank s competitors  management believes the account has helped to reduce the bank s overall cost of funds and has been an integral part of the bank s core account acquisition strategy 
core accounts consist of noninterest bearing deposits demand  now  money market and savings accounts 
paramount checking account balances are generally higher than other account balances  and the account helps the bank develop an overall relationship with its customers  which frequently leads to cross selling opportunities  which the bank actively pursues through direct mailings and other special promotions 
another component to the bank s core account acquisition strategy is the generation of deposit accounts which result from new commercial loan customers who move their deposit relationship to the bank and the continued expansion of the bank s escrow ease product 
escrow ease is specially designed to meet the trust account needs of attorney s  realtors and title companies 
at december   the core accounts represented of total deposit accounts 
through its sullivan financial services subsidiary sullivan  the bank also engages in mortgage banking operations  originating loans for resale into the secondary market 
we treat the operations of sullivan as a separate reporting segment apart from our commercial banking business 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for financial information on our business segments 
for the year ended december   the company recognized net income of million  or per diluted share and per basic share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share and per basic share for the company s performance in reflects a substantial increase in interest income from the loan portfolio due to an increase in loan volume and rate  partially offset by increased interest expense  reflecting an increase in deposits and a substantial increase in the average cost of deposits  reflecting market increases in short term interest rates 
our results were also affected by the recognition of  in income due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
there was no comparable tax benefit in during our deposits increased significantly 
management used the resultant cash to fund the loan and investment portfolio and to pay down federal home loan bank advances 
it is management s intention to seek additional branching opportunities in and around our existing market area 
efforts will also be made to identify acquisition opportunities in and adjacent to our market area 
results of operations versus the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on funds borrowed to support those assets  primarily deposits 
net interest margin is the difference between the weighted average rate received on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average level of interest earning assets as compared with that of interest bearing liabilities 
net income is also affected by the amount of non interest income and other non interest expenses 
net income for the year ended december   the company had net income of million or per basic share compared to net income of million or per basic share for the year ended december  all per share data has been restated to reflect all subsequent stock dividends

inherent in the lending function is the risk of the borrower s inability to repay a loan under its existing terms 
risk elements include non accrual loans  past due and restructured loans  potential problem loans  loan concentrations  and other real estate owned 
non performing assets include loans that are not accruing interest non accrual loans because of principal or interest being in default for a period of days or more 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest  including interest applicable to prior years  is reversed and charged against current income 
until the loan becomes current  any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal until management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of such payments of interest 
the company attempts to minimize overall credit risk through loan diversification and its loan approval procedures 
due diligence begins at the time a borrower and the company begin to discuss the origination of a loan 
documentation  including a borrower s credit history  materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral  the purpose of the loan  the source and timing of the repayment of the loan  and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval 
loans made are also subject to periodic audit and review

other than as disclosed above  there were no loans where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ultimate collectibility of such loans 
as of december  and  there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of the company s total loans 
the company s loans are primarily to businesses and individuals located in northern new jersey 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a sufficient level to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loan losses are charged directly to the allowance when they occur and any recovery is credited to the allowance 
the company s officers analyze risks within the loan portfolio on a continuous basis  by external independent loan review function  and by the company s audit committee 
a risk system  consisting of multiple grading categories  is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves 
in addition to the risk system  management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower  past and expected loss experience  and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve 
these estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are realized in the periods in which they become known 
additions to the allowance are made by provisions charged to expense and the allowance is reduced by net chargeoffs ie loans judged to be uncollectible are charged against the reserve  less any recoveries on the loans 
although management attempts to maintain the allowance at an adequate level  future additions to the allowance may be required based upon changes in market conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require additional provisions based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination

three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total  liquidity the company s liquidity is a measure of its ability to fund loans  withdrawals or maturities of deposits  and other cash outflows in a cost effective manner 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal  maturities of investment securities  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the company s total deposits equaled million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in funds provided by deposit inflows during this period has been sufficient to provide for the company s loan demand 
through the investment portfolio  the company has generally sought to obtain a safe  yet slightly higher yield than would have been available to the company as a net seller of overnight federal funds while still maintaining liquidity 
through its investment portfolio  the company also attempts to manage its maturity gap by seeking maturities of investments  which coincide as closely as possible with maturities of deposits 
the investment portfolio also includes securities held for sale to provide liquidity for anticipated loan demand and liquidity needs 
as of december   liquid assets cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale were approximately million  which represented of total assets and of total deposits and borrowings 
supplementing this liquidity  we have available lines of credit from correspondent banks of approximately million and an additional line of credit with the federal home loan bank of approximately million subject to available collateral  with no borrowings outstanding at december  
at year end  outstanding commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit were million 
management believes that our combined aggregate liquidity position is sufficient to meet our near term funding needs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the following table shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments  as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands standby letters of credit   commitments under standby letters of credit  both financial and performance  do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
contractual obligations the following table shows the contractual obligations of the company by expected payment period  as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligation total less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations   operating leases represent obligations entered into by the company for the use of land  premises and equipment 
the leases generally have escalation terms based upon certain defined indexes 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements  establish prudent asset concentration guidelines  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the investment and asset liability committee alco of the board of directors 
the alco generally reviews the company s liquidity  cash flow needs  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  and current market conditions and interest rates 
one of the monitoring tools used by the alco is an analysis of the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and measures the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap may result in the yield on the institution s assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities resulting in a decrease in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at the periods indicated which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods presented 
except as noted  the amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
certificates of deposit are shown at contractual maturity dates 
interest bearing non maturity deposit balances are allocated within the first three months of the schedule based on recent rate adjustments relative to federal reserve monetary policy changes 
residual balances are placed over one year 
in making the gap computation  loans are presented based on contractual payments and repricing  and standard assumptions regarding prepayment rates on investments have been used for interest earning assets 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions 
as our current position is one of being liability sensitive  we would target the following strategies reduce the level of fixed rate credits and make more floating rate commercial and home equity loans  allow our investments maturing and cash flows from investments to accumulate in federal funds sold  offer longer term certificates of deposit  and borrow fixed rate longer term funds from the federal home loan bank

the company s federal regulators have classified and defined capital into the following components tier i capital  which includes tangible stockholders equity for common stock  qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying hybrid instruments  and tier ii capital  which includes a portion of the allowance for probable loan losses  certain qualifying long term debt  and preferred stock which does not qualify for tier i capital 
minimum capital levels are regulated by risk based capital adequacy guidelines which require certain capital as a percent of the company s assets and certain off balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
a bank holding company is required to maintain  at a minimum  tier i capital as a percentage of risk adjusted assets of and combined tier i and tier ii capital as a percentage of risk adjusted assets of in addition to the risk based guidelines  the company s regulators require that an institution which meets the regulator s highest performance and operation standards maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percentage of tangible assets of 
for those institutions with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating significant growth  the minimum leverage ratio will be evaluated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
the bank is subject to substantially similar regulations by its federal regulators

the company had no outstanding advances at december  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
