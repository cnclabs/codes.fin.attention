item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report  we are restating our consolidated financial statements for periods through march  to reflect the findings of a voluntary  independent investigation of our stock option granting practices and related accounting 
this investigation was conducted by a special committee of the board of directors with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel and outside forensic accounting consultants 
to date  we have incurred significant expenses related to legal  accounting  tax and other professional services in connection with the investigation  the related restatements and related regulatory inquiries or proceedings and litigation matters  and may incur significant expenses in the future with respect to such matters 
these events  even if resolved favorably  may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcomes of regulatory proceedings or litigation matters are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the financial and tax impacts of our historical stock option granting practices  we cannot provide assurance that the securities and exchange commission sec or the internal revenue service irs will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial and tax impacts 
for a discussion of the judgments underlying the revised measurement dates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this report 
if the sec or the irs disagrees with our financial or tax adjustments or related disclosures and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements  we may be required to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec or take other action that is not currently contemplated 
in june we received an informal request for information from the securities and exchange commission regarding our stock option practices 
in january we were informed that the sec issued a formal order of investigation in the matter 
we have also been informally contacted by the us attorney s office for the central district of california and have been asked to voluntarily produce documents relating to our stock option granting practices 
we are cooperating with the sec and the us attorney s office in connection with these matters  but can not predict if  when or how they will be resolved or what  if any  actions we may be required to take as part of any resolution of these matters 
any action by the sec  the us attorney s office or other governmental agency could result in civil or criminal sanctions against us and or certain of our current and former officers  directors and employees 
additionally  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we currently are engaged in civil litigation with parties that have alleged a variety of claims against quest and certain of our current and former officers and directors relating to our stock option grant practices and related accounting 
although we and the other defendants intend to defend these claims vigorously  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions will be resolved without substantial costs and or settlement charges 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our present and former directors and executive officers under which quest is required to indemnify each such directors or executive officers against expenses  including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and settlements  paid by such individual in connection with the pending litigation other than indemnified liabilities arising from willful misconduct or conduct that is knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest 

table of contents the resolution of the pending investigations by the sec and us attorney s office  the defense of our pending civil litigation and any additional litigation relating to our past stock option grant practices or related restatement of our financial statements could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees 
if we do not maintain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted  which could  negatively impact the trading market for our securities and impact our ability to maintain equity based stock incentive programs for our employees as a result of the stock option investigation and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements we could not timely file certain of our periodic reports with the sec and  accordingly  our common stock has remained subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
we still have not yet filed our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   june  and september  and will not have achieved full compliance with sec reporting requirements until these reports are filed  as well as any other periodic reports which may hereafter become due 
in november  the nasdaq board of directors advised the company that we will be required to comply with the nasdaq filing requirements by january  in addition  we were unable to solicit proxies for an annual meeting of shareholders in because we could not provide an annual report to shareholders  and have not been in compliance with the nasdaq requirement to hold an annual meeting of shareholders 
we have also not held a annual meeting of shareholders 
our intention is to hold an annual meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable following the filing of all of our delinquent periodic reports 
our common stock could be delisted if we do not file our remaining delinquent reports with the sec  if we are required to further restate or amend our filings or if we otherwise do not maintain compliance with applicable listing requirements 
if our securities are delisted from the nasdaq global select market  they would subsequently be transferred to the national quotation service bureau  or pink sheets 
the trading of our common stock through the pink sheets might reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
in addition  the trading of our common stock through the pink sheets could materially and adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or to raise capital at all 
securities that trade through the pink sheets are no longer eligible for margin loans  and a company trading through the pink sheets cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or blue sky laws  which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances  including pursuant to employee option plans  stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities 
increased compliance burdens can also be expected to impact our ability to maintain and administer stock option programs and other forms of equity incentives for our employees  which could also impair our ability to recruit and retain key employees 
if we are delisted in the future from the nasdaq global select market and transferred to the pink sheets  we could also be subject to other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our securities 
any or all of the foregoing consequences of delisting could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in assessing the findings of the special committee s review and the restatement set forth in this report  our management concluded that there were material weaknesses  as defined in the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
 in our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  see the discussion included in part ii  item a of this report for additional information regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error or all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

table of contents we cannot assure you that all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified in this report will be adequately remedied or will be fully remedied by any specific date  although we believe that our material weakness in internal controls relating to revenue recognition has been remedied as of the date of filing this report 
in addition  we can provide no assurances that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
we may incur additional expenses in order to assist our employees with potential federal and state income tax liabilities which may arise under section a of the internal revenue code as a result of our stock option investigation  we have determined that many of our outstanding stock option awards are deemed to have been granted at an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the actual accounting measurement date 
the primary adverse tax consequences are that the re measured options vesting after december  are potentially subject to option holder excise tax under section a of the internal revenue code and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state law  and certain incentive stock options previously granted  could be deemed granted at below market value producing incremental payroll tax liabilities 
we have recorded approximately million of expenses in the year ended december  relating to the anticipated settlement by the company of federal and applicable state income taxes on behalf of the company s employees for tainted options that were exercised during employees of the company who continue to hold tainted options may be subject to additional taxes  penalties and interest under section a if no action is taken to cure the options from exposure under section a before december  regarding potential future liabilities associated with section a  we have yet to determine whether we will either implement a plan to assist the affected employees for the amount of this tax  adjust the terms of the original option grant  or adjust the terms of the original option grant and pay the affected employees an amount to compensate such employees for this lost benefit 
as such  no additional expense has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our future success may be impaired and our operating results will suffer if we cannot respond to rapid market  competitive and technological conditions in the software industry the market for our software products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services by platform vendors of database  application and windows products and by our competitors  increasing complexity and interdependence of software applications  consolidation of the software industry  changes in industry standards and practices  and changes in customer requirements and demands 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new products and services  functionality  and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers and prospective customers  which requires significant investment in research and development resources and capabilities  involves significant technical and business risks and requires substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
if we fail to anticipate new technology developments  customer requirements  industry standards  or if we are unable to develop new products and services that adequately address these new developments  requirements  and standards in a timely manner  or if we are incapable of timely bringing new or enhanced products to market  our products and services may become obsolete  we may not generate suitable returns from our research and development investments  and our ability to compete may be impaired  our revenue could decline  and our operating results may suffer 

table of contents during the past three years  a large portion of our revenue growth has been attributable to the growth of our microsoft systems management products and services  and we have relied upon sustained revenue and cash flow generation from our database management products in order to fund sales  marketing and research and development initiatives associated with our other product areas 
we cannot provide any assurance that the revenues we derive from these product areas will continue to grow 
in addition  over the last few years we have committed significant resources to development of new and enhanced application management products and have expanded our sales and services organizations to address anticipated business opportunities presented by our expanding application management product and services lines 
we cannot provide any assurance that this strategy will be successful or that the release of our enhanced application management products or other new products or services will increase our revenue growth rate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and  as a result  we may fail to meet expectations of investors and analysts  causing our stock price to fluctuate or decline our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
these factors include the following the size and timing of customer orders 
see variations in the size and timing of our customer orders and differing nature of our products and services could expose us to revenue fluctuations and higher operating costs  the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing decisions and budget cycles  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us  exposure to general economic conditions and reductions in corporate or public sector it spending  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  our ability to attain market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements to our existing products  our ability to introduce new products or enhancements to existing products and services in a timely manner  our ability to maintain our field and inside sales organizations with adequate numbers of sales and services personnel  and to minimize our costs of sales and marketing through efficient allocation of sales resources and methods to products having different sales characteristics and profiles  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors and changes in the pricing policies of these competitors  the relative growth rates of competing operating system  database and application platforms and competitive conditions among vendors of these platforms  the unpredictability of the timing  level of sales and subsequent revenue recognition of our expanded efforts within our indirect sales channels  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  including acquired in process research and development and amortization costs for intangible assets and possible impairments and uncertainties arising from the integration of products  services  employees and operations of acquired companies  and the timing of releases of new versions of third party software products that our products support or with which our products compete 
in addition  the timing of our software product revenues is difficult to predict and can vary substantially from product to product and customer to customer 
we budget our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
the timing of larger orders and customer buying patterns are difficult to forecast 
therefore  we may not learn of shortfalls in revenue or earnings or other failures to meet our expectations until late in a particular quarter 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we would not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 

table of contents we have experienced seasonality in our orders and revenues  which may result in seasonality in our earnings 
the fourth quarter of the year typically has the highest orders and revenues for the year and higher orders and revenues than the first quarter of the following year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from the budgeting cycles of our customers being typically higher in the third and fourth quarters and  to a lesser extent  from the structure of our sales commission program 
in addition  the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter to finalize orders has resulted in higher order volumes towards the end of the quarter 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
fluctuations in our results of operations are also likely to affect the market price of our common stock  if our operating results differ from expectations of investors or securities analysts  and may not be related to or indicative of our long term performance 
variations in the size and timing of our customer orders and differing nature of our products and services could expose us to revenue fluctuations and higher operating costs our license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and delivered in that quarter 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license transactions or if the contract terms were to prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
the sales cycles for certain of our software products can last from three to nine months  or longer  and often require pre purchase evaluation periods and customer education  which can affect timing of orders 
further  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month  weeks or days of each quarter and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall short of anticipated levels 
finally  while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from previously deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon current order volumes to generate revenues for that quarter 
these factors may cause significant periodic variation in our license revenues 
in addition  we incur or commit to operating expenses based on anticipated revenue levels  and generally do not know whether revenues in any quarter will meet expectations until the end of that quarter 
our product portfolio is engineered for a broad variety of operating system  database and application platforms  and having a diverse set of functions and features 
some products  such as our database management products and other component products  are directed at database administrators and are generally sold at lower price points  and we strive to generate demand for these products through our telesales organization and marketing programs designed to maximize lead generation and website traffic 
sales of other  enterprise wide products  primarily shareplex and foglight  require substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff as well as involvement by our professional services organizations and  to an increasing degree  our systems integrator partners 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations for a particular period 
historically  we have not placed significant reliance on large sales transactions in any given quarter  with a substantial volume of our revenues being driven from smaller transactions 
however  if we encounter difficulty sustaining our component product volumes  and cannot generate a sufficient number of large customer orders  or if customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
for these reasons  we face increasing complexity in building and sustaining the optimum combination of field and inside sales personnel to address the various and changing sales and distribution characteristics of our products  which in turn impacts our ability to manage and minimize our sales and marketing costs 
we rely heavily on our direct sales activities for license and services revenues  including renewals of annual maintenance contracts 
we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to management changes  product changes  performance issues and other internal considerations 
we recently made some adjustments to our coverage model to increase focus on global and other major accounts 
we ve also recently increased headcount in our telesales and sales associate groups 
these changes can result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity  which could have temporary negative effects on our license or services revenues 
accordingly  if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  or if we fail to efficiently correlate our sales and marketing resources to our various products and their differing sales and distribution strategies  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature and cannot be easily or quickly changed 

table of contents many of our products are vulnerable to direct competition from oracle and other platform vendors we compete with oracle in the market for database management solutions and the competitive pressure continues to increase 
we expect that oracle s commitment to and presence in the database management product market will increase in the future and therefore substantially increase competitive pressures 
we believe that oracle will continue to incorporate database management technology into its server software offerings and expand their development products possibly at no additional cost to its users 
competition from oracle with certain of our database management products including shareplex and quest central for oracle has increased over the last two years and has continued to increase with oracle s introduction of the next version of its database  known as oracle g 
oracle g has enhanced capabilities in the functions competitive with shareplex  quest central for oracle and with the oracle monitoring capabilities of foglight including monitoring capabilities from the entire application stack 
we believe increased competition from oracle has materially depressed our shareplex and quest central for oracle revenues over the last four years 
oracle recently released sql developer which competes with toad  our market leading database development product for oracle databases which contributes significantly to our revenues and net income 
in addition to the increasing competitive pressure from oracle  microsoft has continually upgraded the functionality of its platform offerings  which we also believe will increase competitive pressure for our microsoft products in the future 
in some cases these types of platform vendor provided tools are bundled with the platform and in other cases they are separately chargeable products  albeit at significantly lower price points 
the inclusion of the functionality of our software as standard features of the underlying database solution or application supported by our products or sale at much lower cost could erode our revenues  particularly if the competing products and features were of comparable capability to our products 
even if the functionality provided as standard features or lower costs by these system providers is more limited than that of our software  there can be no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing our products 
moreover  there is substantial risk that the mere announcements of competing products or features by large competitors such as oracle could result in the delay or cancellation of customer orders for our products in anticipation of the introduction of such new products or features 
our migration products for microsoft s active directory and exchange are vulnerable to fluctuations in the rate at which customers migrate to these products our products for the migration  administration and management of microsoft s active directory and exchange products currently contribute approximately one quarter of our windows platform revenue  but migration license sales declined slightly in our ability to sell licenses for our active directory and exchange migration products depends in part on the rate at which customers migrate to newer versions of microsoft s active directory or to newer versions of microsoft exchange  and from other messaging platforms to exchange 
if these migration rates were to materially decrease  our license revenues from these migration products would likely decline 
many of our products are dependent on database or application technologies of others  if these technologies lose market share or become incompatible with our products  or if these vendors introduce competitive products or acquire or form strategic relationships with our competitors  the demand for our products could suffer we believe that our success has depended in part  and will continue to depend in part for the foreseeable future  upon our relationships with providers of major database and enterprise software programs  including oracle  ibm  microsoft and sap 
our competitive advantage consists in substantial part on the integration between our products and products provided by these major software providers  and our extensive knowledge of their products and technologies 
if these companies for any reason decide to promote technologies and standards that are not compatible with our technologies  or if they lose market share for their database or application products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  these major software vendors could attempt to increase their presence in the markets we serve by either introducing products that compete with our products or acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors 
these companies have longer operating histories  larger installed bases of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do  as well as well established relationships with many of our present and potential customers  and may be in better position to withstand and respond to the current factors impacting this industry 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to manage our operations and grow revenue or fail to continue to effectively control expenses  our future operating results could be adversely affected historically  the scope of our operations  the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations and our revenue have grown rapidly 
in addition  we have acquired both domestic and international companies 
this growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage our current growth and any future growth effectively  we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
we may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way 
we cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter 
if we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response 
any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter 
also  due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth  our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years 
failure to develop and sustain additional distribution channels in the future may adversely affect our ability to grow revenues we intend to direct additional efforts to drive domestic and international revenue growth through sales of our products and services through indirect distribution channels  such as global hardware and software vendors  systems integrators  or value added resellers 
our ability to increase future revenues depends on our ability to expand our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail in our efforts to maintain  expand and diversify our indirect distribution channels  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
increasing activity in indirect distribution channels will present a number of additional risks  including we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  which may result in lost sales and customer confusion  our channel partners can cease marketing and distributing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  our channel partners may not be able to effectively sell our products and services  our channel partners may experience financial difficulties that might lead to delays  or even default  in their payment obligations  we may not be able to recruit additional channel partners  or replace any of our existing ones  and our channel partners may also offer competitive products and services  and may not give priority to marketing our products or services 
intense competition in the markets for our products could adversely affect our results of operations the markets for our products are highly competitive 
as a result  our future success will be affected by our ability to  among other things  outperform our competitors in meeting the needs of current and prospective customers and identifying and addressing new technological and market opportunities 
our competitors may develop more advanced technology  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and undertake more effective sales and marketing campaigns and may be able to leverage more extensive financial  technical or partner resources 
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position  our revenues may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our operating results may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our international operations are generally conducted through our international subsidiaries  with the associated revenues and related expenses  and balance sheets  denominated in the currency of the country in which the international subsidiaries operate 
as a result  our operating results may be harmed by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents our international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations expose us to certain risks we maintain research and development operations primarily in canada  australia  russia and israel  and continue to expand our international sales activities  with particular focus in asia pacific including japan  as part of our business strategy 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues outside of north america were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result  we face increasing risks from our international operations  including  among others difficulties in staffing  managing and operating our foreign operations  difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  difficulties in adapting our existing foreign operations  particularly in asia  to the control structure and requirements of a us public entity given those asian countries historical environment and their cultural approach to conducting business  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in emea and in other periods in other countries  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  difficulties in hedging foreign currency transaction exposures  limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenue from international operations if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  delays in localizing our products  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  our ability to adapt and conform to accepted local business practices and customs  including providing letters of credit or other forms of support to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries or resellers  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  including employment restrictions  and compliance with licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 
operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and will place additional burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that investment and additional resources required in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing them internationally 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
acquisitions require us to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition or may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
we may have to use cash  incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
use of cash or debt may affect our liquidity and use of cash would reduce our cash reserves and reduce our 
table of contents financial flexibility 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of an acquisition 
accounting for equity investments in companies may affect our operating results we have made equity investments in other software companies and a private equity fund 
we regularly consider opportunities to make equity investments in other companies focused on software development or marketing activities  and expect from time to time to complete additional investments 
these investments are risky because the market for the products and technologies being developed by these companies are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
in addition  we have made at least one investment in a private software company that has required us to consolidate the results of operations of this company into ours and we may determine in the future to invest in additional companies at similar levels 
estimating the fair value of our equity investments is inherently subjective and may contribute to volatility in our reported results of operations 
we have recognized accounting charges due to the impairment of the value of our investments in the past and may need to do so again in the future if we cannot substantiate the fair value of our strategic equity investments 
if we are required to consolidate the operating results of these companies  use the equity method of accounting  or write down the value of our cost method investments  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we face risks associated with governmental contracting we derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with the united states government and its agencies and from contracts with state and local governments or agencies 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability  with funding reductions or delays adversely impacting public sector demand for our products and services 
public sector customers may also change the way they procure new contracts and may adopt new rules or regulations governing contract procurement  including required competitive bidding or use of open source products  where available 
these factors may limit the growth of or reduce the amount of revenues we derive from the public sector  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
we may not generate increased business from our current customers  which could slow our revenue growth in the future most of our customers initially make a purchase of our products for a single department or location 
many of these customers may choose not to expand their use of our products 
if we fail to generate expanded business from our current customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  as we deploy new modules and features for our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may choose not to purchase this new functionality or these new products 
moreover  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues would be materially adversely affected 
failure to develop or leverage strategic relationships could harm our business by denying us selling opportunities and other benefits our development  marketing  and distribution strategies rely increasingly on our ability to form strategic relationships with software and other technology companies 
these business relationships often consist of cooperative marketing programs  joint customer seminars  lead referrals  and cooperation in product development 
many of these relationships are not contractual and depend on the continued voluntary cooperation of each party with us 
divergence in strategy or change in focus by  or competitive product offerings by  any of these companies may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell  or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
further  if these companies enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired  they could reduce their support of our products 
our existing relationships may be jeopardized if we enter into alliances with competitors of our strategic partners 
in addition  one or more of these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we generally rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  patent  copyright law and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 

table of contents despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such resulting litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and financial resources  which could harm our business 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate and competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also believe that  because of the rapid rate of technological change in the software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of customer support services 
third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe on their intellectual property rights  exposing us to litigation that  regardless of merit  may be costly to defend our success and ability to compete are also dependent upon our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claim  with or without merit  could have a significant effect on our business and financial results 
any future third party claim could be time consuming  divert management s attention from our business operations and result in substantial litigation costs  including any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations  which may result from such claims 
in addition  parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 
as a result of such claims  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or redesign our products 
we cannot be sure that such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a successful claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology  our business and financial results and position could be materially adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected if our software contains errors or security flaws the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors or security flaws will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or security flaws or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
the detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 

table of contents we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the shipping of  our products certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business a substantial portion of our operations is located in california  and we are subject to risks of damage and business disruptions resulting from earthquakes  floods  wildfires and similar events  as well as from power outages 
we have in the past experienced limited and temporary power outages in our california facilities due to power shortages  and we expect in the future to experience additional power losses 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that natural disasters or power outages will not adversely affect our business in the future 
since we do not have sufficient redundancy in our networking infrastructure  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could have an adverse effect on our business  including both our internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell and deliver our products 
failure to attract and retain personnel may negatively impact our business our success and ability to compete depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  sales  engineering  marketing  support  professional services and finance personnel 
we have recently had moderate turnover in our sales and research and development organizations  significant turnover in the management of our accounting and finance department  and many key positions are held by people who are new to the company or to their roles 
if these people are unable to quickly become familiar with the issues they face in their roles or are not well suited to their new roles  then this could result in the company having problems in executing its strategy or in reporting its financial results 
we are uniquely dependent upon the talents  relationships and contributions of a few executives and have no guarantee of their retention 
we have been targeted by recruitment agencies seeking to hire our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our shareholders  encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages 
during the pendency of our stock option investigation and related restatement  we were unable to continue granting stock options to new and existing employees and did not permit exercises of outstanding stock options 
these actions have impacted our overall competitive posture with respect to employee compensation and retention of qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or fail to reach expected levels of productivity  our ability to develop and market our products will be weakened

background and scope of the investigation on may   a financial analyst at deutsche bank published a report entitled infrastructure sw update analyzing potential for backdated stock options 
the report analyzed the likelihood of various software companies having historically back dated equity awards 
quest software was identified in this report as one company with characteristics similar to other companies which had previously announced stock option investigations 
after reviewing the deutsche bank report  our general counsel and then chief financial officer initiated an internal review of the facts and circumstances of our historical stock option granting practices and related documentation 
on may   the board of directors was briefed on the existence of the deutsche bank report and preliminary results of the internal review 
on may   our board formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct an investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting 
the special committee was initially comprised of kevin m 
klausmeyer and augustine l 
nieto ii  both members of the audit committee  with the understanding that mr 
nieto would serve temporarily until another independent  disinterested member was appointed 
on june   h 
john dirks joined our board and was appointed to the audit committee and the special committee  replacing mr 
nieto as a member of the special committee 
the special committee retained outside legal counsel  duane morris llp  and duane morris retained forensic accounting consultants  navigant consulting  inc  to assist in the investigation 
the special committee s investigation covered facts  circumstances and timing of stock option grants made by the company from june to december the special committee and its advisors reviewed voluminous electronic and hard copy documents  including files of the company s current and former employees  officers and directors involved in the administration and approval of  as well as in the accounting for  stock option grants made under the company s stock option programs 
in addition to the documents reviewed  the special committee s lawyers conducted interviews with more than individuals that had knowledge of our stock option granting practices  including current and former employees  officers and directors 
historical stock option granting practices prior to january   we accounted for our stock option grants under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
and had provided the required disclosures pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
on january   we adopted 
table of contents sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  under the modified prospective method 
for the accounting measurement date revisions made  we revised the historical pro forma footnote disclosures made in accordance with sfas additionally  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march  to reflect the impact of revised accounting measurement dates on compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r 
as permitted by the terms of our stock incentive plans  the board of directors was vested with the authority to administer and grant stock options under the plans  and the board of directors had delegated general authority for stock option plan administration to the compensation committee of the board 
until august  all employee stock option grants were required to be approved by the board of directors or the compensation committee 
beginning in august and as permitted by the terms of our stock incentive plans  the board of directors delegated authority  subject to specific parameters  to our chief executive officer as a secondary committee to approve stock option awards to employees other than officers or directors of the company 
option grants to officers and directors and other grants outside of the parameters discussed below continued to require compensation committee approval in order to complete the required granting actions 
from june through december  the exercise price for all stock option grants was typically set at the closing sale price of our common stock on the original stated grant date  as reported by nasdaq 
during this period  we made the following types of grants of stock options to employees  including officers  and members of our board of directors annual  broad based grants to large numbers of employees referred to as annual grants  grants to newly hired employees and grants to existing employees from time to time referred to as new hire or merit grants  options granted or assumed in connection with acquisitions  and options granted to non employee members of our board of directors according to the automatic grant program of our stock incentive plan 
for our stock option grants dated from june through early  we generally sought approval of the entire board of directors  including all new hire  merit and annual grants 
prior to september  we did not have a defined process for determining the date on which we made grants  and no regular granting pattern could be established from our review of the facts and circumstances of those granting actions 
accordingly  the special committee concluded that required granting actions for stock option grants during the pre ipo period between june and june were not completed with the required specificity and finality until june  on this date  we adopted our stock incentive plan in contemplation of our ipo  which was completed in august beginning in late  we changed our stock option granting practices by implementing a practice where we typically dated new hire and merit grants to employees on a monthly basis  where the grant date for any given new hire would be based on the month during which the new hire signed an employment offer letter or started employment with the company 
when option grants were granted to existing employees as merit grants  they were approved using the same practice and included in the monthly new hire grant procedure 
option grants for these grants for a given month were dated as of the trading date during that month on which the closing price for our common stock reported by nasdaq was determined to be the lowest monthly closing price  and the exercise price established for those option grants was the closing sale price of the common stock on such date 
we made annual or broad based  company wide grants in  and to executive and non executive employees as of grant dates determined on the same basis as new hire or merit grants 
the special committee also determined that approvals for certain option grants made in connection with acquisitions were obtained in connection with new hire or merit grants during this period  and that the period within which new hire and merit grant dates were determined was expanded from monthly to quarterly on a few occasions 
all discretionary employee grants required approval by the board of directors or the compensation committee to complete the required granting actions 
for most grants we did not obtain approval from the board of directors or compensation committee most often by means of a form of unanimous written consent that reflected an as of approval date  until after the end of the period the particular month or quarter within which the original grant date was intended 
beginning with our april granting action  we sought compensation committee approval for all discretionary stock option grants to employees and other eligible participants  including consultants 
in may  we changed our stock option granting practices by determining grant dates and exercise prices as of the date when the required granting actions were actually completed 
as a result  our april monthly new hire and merit grant was the last monthly grant for which the originally stated grant date was determined using the methodology of determining a grant price on a monthly or quarterly basis 

table of contents in august  the board of directors established a secondary committee under the terms of our stock incentive plan and stock incentive plan  consisting of vincent c 
smith  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and delegated authority to the secondary committee to approve awards of stock options to employees within specific parameters 
the delegation provided authority to grant up to  options to any employee in connection with his or her hiring into the company  and up to  options to existing employees  provided  however  than no authority was delegated with respect to option grants to officers or directors of the company 
compensation committee approval continued to be a required granting action for all stock option grants outside of the parameters of the delegated authority 
for grants outside the scope of delegated authority  the compensation committee approved such grants at a meeting or by unanimous written consent form 
prior to the restatement discussed below  we used the originally stated grant dates as set forth above as the measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
accordingly  in each case the exercise price was determined to be equal to the closing stock price of our common stock as reported by nasdaq on that date 
in the restatement  we revised the accounting measurement dates for many grants and recorded stock based compensation expense when the revised measurement date resulted in intrinsic value 
findings of the investigation and measurement date determinations the special committee performed a detailed review of all stock option grants awarded from august  the date of the company s initial public offering through june  and all annual grants from july  through december  covering grants to purchase  shares of common stock made in  awards on granting dates 
the special committee also performed limited testing on a sample of stock option grants made prior to the initial public offering covering grants to purchase  shares of common stock made in awards on granting dates 
the special committee also performed limited testing on a sampling of new hire and merit stock option grants awarded after june  covering grants to purchase  shares of common stock representing of all new hire and merit options granted during this period 
we classified option grants subject to the investigation into three time periods june through august the pre ipo period  september through april   and may  through december because annual  broad based grants were made in a process substantially similar to new hire and merit grants  we did not separately classify option grants by the nature of their granting process 
based on the facts obtained as a result of the special committee investigation  we identified grants for which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting purposes  as defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
to determine the correct accounting measurement dates for these grants we followed the guidance in apb no 
 which deems the measurement date to be the first date on which all of the following are known with finality the identity of the individual employee who is entitled to receive the option grant  the number of options that the individual employee is entitled to receive  and the option s exercise price 
the special committee performed a grant date by grant date analysis of approximately option grant dates during the pre ipo period  option grant dates between the ipo and june  and all annual grants from july  through december for compliance with apb no 
where we determined that we did not complete the required granting actions by the original grant date  we used judgment to determine corrected accounting measurement dates for all awards included within the granting action on each grant date consistent with what the evidence suggested was our practice or process 
if the revised measurement date was not the same date we used previously  we made accounting adjustments as required  which resulted in stock based compensation and related tax effects when an option had intrinsic value on the revised accounting measurement date 
the special committee reviewed a variety of documents and information in connection with its investigation including but not limited to the following minutes of meetings of the board of directors and the compensation committee  actions by unanimous written consent signed by directors  together with evidence relating to the date such consents were requested and or signed and returned  information contained in employee personnel files  electronic mail messages and other electronic files retrieved from our computer system and in back up media  information concerning the date or dates on which a stock option was entered into our stock option tracking system  equity edge  
table of contents information concerning the date on which a notice of stock option grants and accompanying stock option agreement was signed on behalf of quest by an executive officer  which we considered to represent the company s contractual commitment to complete the particular grant  correspondence  memoranda and other documentation supporting the option grant  and information obtained during interviews conducted by the special committee s legal counsel of numerous individuals  including current and former officers  directors  employees and outside professionals 
a total of  awards covering grants to purchase  shares of common stock required measurement date changes  of which options to purchase  shares of common stock were granted to employees who were executive officers of the company at the time of their respective grant dates 
none of our non employee directors received stock option grants requiring measurement date corrections 
the special committee determined that both current and former senior management contributed to the company s lack of controls and inappropriate grant practices 
specifically  the special committee determined that two former chief financial officers and a former corporate controller  failed to perform the responsibilities of their positions and contributed to the company s lack of controls and inappropriate grant practices 
one former chief financial officer resigned from the company for unrelated reasons in january the other chief financial officer resigned from the company on november   after declining to be interviewed by the special committee 
the corporate controller was reassigned from his accounting management role in october the special committee made no finding of fraud or intentional misconduct by any current or former employees  officers or directors  and concluded that no further changes in the company s executive officers will be recommended

the special committee determined that accounting measurement dates for most of the stock option grants during the period from june  through august  were incorrectly determined 
these instances involved an aggregate of stock option grants awarded to employees covering  shares of common stock 
specifically  the special committee discovered evidence that required details of awards covering  shares covered by all grants between june and june  did not have the required level of finality or were not supported by sufficient documentation until june   the date on which the company s stock incentive plan was adopted by the company and approved by its shareholders 

table of contents for the stock option grants awarded between june  through august   the company was unable to locate evidence of completion of required granting actions specifically  approval of the stock option grants by the company s board of directors or compensation committee 
these instances involved an aggregate of stock option grants to employees to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
none of these stock options were granted to executive officers or senior officers who participated in the stock option granting processes associated with these grants 
the company has been honoring these stock options awards and settling them with stock and intends to continue doing so 
measurement date determinations for these option grants were made on the basis of all available relevant information and reflect the company s reasonable conclusion as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred and related facts and circumstances 
specifically  we used evidence of the dates on which the notices of grant were executed on behalf of the company as the best evidence of the granting actions actually completed  and used those dates as the revised measurement dates for financial reporting purposes 
corrections to the accounting measurement dates for option grants during the pre ipo period resulted in the recording of additional pre tax stock based compensation of million 
post ipo grants september through april in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a practice of processing option grants to newly hired employees and merit or promotion grants to existing employees on a monthly basis  starting with the grants dated september  and to determine a single grant date for stock options granted within each of those particular months 
the special committee found evidence demonstrating that stock option grants made in any given month were routinely made as of the trading date associated with the lowest closing sale price reported by nasdaq for our common stock from september through april  with only a few grants during such period made on other dates 
the special committee also found evidence that the option grant dating practice expanded to quarterly  rather than monthly  grant date determinations 
for stock option grants during this time period  the special committee determined that administrative approvals for required granting actions were generally documented by unanimous written consents of the board or the compensation committee  and were dated as of the date corresponding to the trading date in a given month or quarter on which the company s last sale price was determined to be the lowest in that period  all of such unanimous written consents were prepared after the selected grant dates and were executed by members of the board or compensation committee at a later time  in some cases as much as up to three months after the selected grant date  and in certain cases  the lists reflecting stock option grants processed by the company s stock plan administrator were different than the lists provided to and approved by either the board or compensation committee  as the case may be 
for each of the discretionary grants affected by the special committee s findings during this period  the special committee determined an accounting measurement date based on information and documentation evidencing the date as of which the related action by unanimous written consent uwc had been signed by all of the directors or  in the case of compensation committee action  members of the compensation committee 
however  in many cases  the company was unable to locate definitive and complete documentation evidencing the date on which the last required approval of a uwc was signed by certain directors and received by the company 
for these stock option grants  the company s measurement date determinations were made on the basis of all available relevant information and reflect the company s reasonable conclusion as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred based on related facts and circumstances 
for grants where there was insufficient evidence to determine when all required written consents were actually obtained  but there was evidence of the dates of receipt of individual written consents such as contemporaneous electronic messages to or from individuals involved in the granting activities or facsimile header dates on signed unanimous written consent forms  we used this information as evidence of when the compensation committee approval was obtained  and used that date as the revised measurement date for financial reporting purposes 
in other cases where we could not locate evidence of the date or dates on which required granting approvals were obtained  we used evidence of the dates on which the notices of grant were executed on behalf of the company as the best evidence of the granting actions actually completed  and used those dates as the revised measurement dates for financial reporting purposes 
we believe that these grants were communicated to employees in a timely manner 
in some cases  we awarded option grants that were different in amount than that approved by the required granting actions or to employees whose awards were not included in lists approved by the board of directors or compensation committee 
in each of these circumstances  we evaluated the existing information related to each individual grant and we established a new accounting measurement date when we determined that the terms of the award were fixed with finality  which was generally the date on which the related notice of grant was signed on behalf of the company 

table of contents section insiders received stock options covering an aggregate of  shares of common stock in these grant events  which collectively resulted in million of additional compensation expense over the restatement period 
see the discussion under the heading remedial actions below with respect to actions taken by the company with respect to option awards to section insiders 
employees other than section insiders received options to purchase an aggregate of  shares in these grant events 
corrections to the measurement dates for all of the misdated grants during the period from september through april resulted in the recording of additional stock based compensation expense of million 
sensitivity analysis revised measurement dates for certain grants awarded during the period from september to september could not be determined with certainty 
we therefore made judgments to establish the revised dates 
these awards were made on six dates and covered options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock  or approximately one half of the total number of shares covered by stock options granted during this period 
for these grants  we have recorded pre tax compensation expense adjustments of approximately million 
we determined the revised measurement dates for these awards based upon the dates upon which the company signed the notices of grant which was deemed for measurement date purposes  to be the dates on which the grants were completed 
had we used different judgments regarding the timing of the revised measurement dates  the stock based compensation expense charges we recorded in the restatement would have been different 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that we might have recorded for these grants if we had used different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates 
we applied our sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stock based compensation expense within a range of possible measurement dates for each grant event  which ranged from the originally recorded grant date to the revised measurement date 
while we believe the evidence and methodology used to determine the revised measurement dates to be the most appropriate  we also believe that illustrating the differences in stock based compensation expense using these alternative date ranges provides incremental insight into the extent to which hypothetical stock based compensation expense would have fluctuated if we chose other measurement dates 
after developing the range for each grant event included in our sensitivity analysis  we selected the highest and lowest closing sale price of our common stock within the date range to determine the range of potential compensation expense adjustments for the grants 
we then compared these aggregated amounts to the stock based compensation expense that we recorded for the stock option grants analyzed 
if we had used the highest closing sale price of our common stock within the date range for these grant events  our stock based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have increased by approximately million  from million to million 
conversely  had we used the lowest closing sale price of our common stock within the date range for the grants analyzed  we would not have recorded a stock based compensation expense adjustment for these specific grants  as the fair market value of our common stock on those dates would have been at or below the actual exercise price of the options awarded 
post ipo grants may  through december the special committee performed a detailed review of all stock option grants awarded between may  and june  and all annual grants awarded between may  and december measurement date exceptions were noted for grants covering options to purchase  shares  for which an additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  has been recorded in the restated financial statements included in this report 
based on the significant improvements in the company s stock option granting practices during this period  the special committee determined to conduct limited sampling and testing of new hire and merit stock option grants awarded after june  the special committee sampled new hire and merit grants  covering  shares of common stock of all shares covered 
table of contents by new hire and merit option grants 
the remaining new hire and merit stock option grants occurring during the period from july  through december  were not individually reviewed and did not appear to have any unusual pricing or other characteristics indicating a need for full individual review 
sampling and other analysis indicated that these remaining grants consisted of new hire and merit grants to non officer employees 
various tests were performed to determine whether these remaining grants had any unique pricing or other characteristics 
none were identified  although measurement date exceptions were noted for grants covering options to purchase  shares  for which an additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  has been recorded in the restated financial statements included in this report 
given the immaterial number of shares and limited income statement impact  along with the absence of unique pricing or other characteristics  additional review procedures were not deemed necessary for these remaining grants occurring after june  and were therefore not applied 
other stock option related adjustments in addition to adjustments to our reported stock based compensation expenses resulting from corrections to accounting measurement dates  the restatement also reflects stock option related adjustments arising from a variety of other issues discovered during our investigation we recorded compensation expense as a result of modifications to stock options made or deemed to have been made to certain employees in connection with their termination of employment or extended leaves of absence 
typically such modifications related to  or resulted in  extensions of the time periods following cessation of service within which these employees could exercise vested stock options 
we have recorded incremental pre tax stock based compensation expense associated with such modifications in the aggregate amount of million 
we identified certain stock option grants awarded to non executive employees which were repriced or otherwise modified in circumstances which required variable accounting treatment 
we also identified an option grant awarded to a non employee consultant deemed to have been granted in exchange for services 
we have recorded incremental pre tax stock based compensation expense associated with these stock option awards in the aggregate amount of million 
we determined that our accounting treatment for a restricted stock issuance in was incorrect 
we issued  shares of common stock to an employee in connection with his initial employment with the company as vice president  marketing  and accepted this employee s secured promissory note in the principal amount of million as payment of the purchase price for the shares 
in june  we determined that we should have treated the promissory note as a non recourse obligation and  accordingly  treated the transaction as a stock option for financial reporting purposes 
we also determined that we should not have accrued approximately million of interest income on the promissory note that we accrued from through march  but deemed the error to be immaterial to our results of operations 
we have recorded an adjustment to our beginning retained earnings balance as of january  to reverse the interest income previously recorded on this promissory note 
we incorrectly calculated the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed by the company in connection with certain acquisition transactions 
as a result  we have reduced the stock based compensation expense resulting from the amounts of unearned compensation recorded in connection with those acquisitions in the aggregate amount of million 
we determined that volatility assumptions used previously to estimate the fair value of our stock option grants required correction 
as a result  we revised our fair value estimates based on corrected volatility assumptions for the period beginning january  and ending december  all but million of the foregoing adjustments were recorded in periods preceding as a result  most of the impact of these adjustments is reflected in the adjustment of our opening accumulated deficit balance at january  in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we may also incur additional expenses as a result of certain federal and state income tax consequences of the findings of our stock option investigation 
we have determined that many of our outstanding stock option awards are deemed to have been granted at an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the actual accounting measurement date 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that the re measured options vesting after december  are potentially subject to option holder excise tax under section a of the internal revenue code and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state law 
we have recorded approximately million of expenses in the year ended december  relating to the anticipated settlement by the company of federal and applicable state income taxes on behalf of the company s employees for tainted options that were exercised during employees of the company who continue to hold tainted options that 
table of contents vested after december  or are still unvested may be subject to additional taxes  penalties and interest under section a if no action is taken to cure the options from exposure under section a before december  the company has yet to determine whether it will either implement a plan to assist the affected employees for the amount of this tax  adjust the terms of the original option grant  or adjust the terms of the original option grant and pay the affected employees an amount to compensate such employees for this lost benefit with respect to the unexercised options that vested after december  remedial actions the following remedial steps were directed or recommended by the special committee in december for stock options which required measurement date changes granted to officers of the company section insiders who  at the time of grant  were required to file the reports required pursuant to section of the securities exchange act of executive options  the special committee required amendments to those executive options to increase the exercise price of any such stock options which remain outstanding to the market value of our common stock as reported by nasdaq on the revised accounting measurement date 
the executive options held by our section insiders were amended as set forth in the table below  without the payment of any consideration by the company officer original grant date options outstanding original exercise price amended exercise price vincent c

brooks the special committee also determined to adopt a variety of process and corporate governance changes  including changes adopted in connection with the proposed settlement of the company s shareholder derivative litigation 
the proposed corporate governance measures include  among other things  implementing certain policies  procedures and guidelines for stock option grants  adopting additional standards of director independence  adopting the majority vote standard for uncontested elections of directors  incorporating term limits for independent directors years and for audit committee members consecutive years  and incorporating additional policies  procedures and guidelines 
in addition  the board approved certain amendments to the company s stock incentive plan and stock incentive plan 
the stock option plan amendments include a new requirement that the exercise price for all nonqualified stock options ie  stock options which do not qualify for incentive stock option treatment under applicable provisions of the 
table of contents internal revenue code of  as amended must be not less than the market value of quest s common stock on the grant date 
prior to this change  the exercise price for nonqualified stock options was required by the plans to be established by the applicable plan administrator 
the company s board of directors also approved related updates to the written charters of the board s audit committee  compensation committee and nominating corporate governance committee  and a related update to the company s corporate governance guidelines 
non stock option related adjustments the company has determined that additional errors in its historical financials statements require correction in this restatement 
many of these errors were identified by the company or its auditors in connection with the restatement related procedures 
other adjustments include items identified in prior periods  but deemed them not to be material to the company s results of operations  and are included in this restatement 
a summary of the impact of these adjustments to pre tax income for the years ended december  and in thousands  is as follows increase decrease in pre tax income category year ended december  revenue adjustments financial system programming error incorrect interpretation of complex orders inconsistent application of company policies other total revenue adjustments expense adjustments incorrect application of sfas no

other total other income expense  net adjustments total all adjustments revenue adjustments based upon a review of more than  software license and services transactions over the restatement period  the company identified several instances where previously reported revenues were required to be corrected and recognized across various and appropriate reporting periods 
there were several categories of revenue adjustments  but most were attributable to the following three categories of errors first  a programming error made at the time of our financial system s initial implementation in  resulted in a systematic miscalculation of the timing of revenue recognition across certain of the company s orders that contained a post contract technical support services referred to as pcs line item 
the error was identified and corrected in however we failed to evaluate the impact of the programming error and its effect on previously reported revenues 
this error caused a shift in the timing of revenue recognition for all affected orders across numerous quarters and years  resulting in periodic quarterly over and understatements of revenue 
second  incorrect interpretations with respect to the timing of revenue recognition for certain complex orders resulted in an overstatement of license and or pcs revenue either early in the contract or around the time of initial customer purchase and an understatement of the corresponding revenue either later in the contract or over a ratable period designated in the contract 
third  inconsistent application of the company s revenue recognition policies in geographies outside north america resulted in an overstatement of license and pcs revenue at and around the time of initial customer purchase and an understatement of the corresponding revenue at the time of cash collection 

table of contents operating expenses and other income expense  net adjustments the company also identified several instances where previously reported operating expenses or other income expense  net items were required to be corrected and recognized across various reporting periods 
the first item related to an incorrect application of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where we performed our impairment analysis of acquired technology at the acquisition level as opposed to a product by product level approach  which resulted in an understatement of intangibles amortization expense related to acquired assets in the period that the impairment occurred and a corresponding overstatement of the related expense over that asset s remaining estimated useful life 
the second item related to the incorrect revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries as required by sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  which resulted in the periodic misstatement both over and under of the other income expense  net line item on the income statement with the corresponding offsetting impact to monetary asset and liability accounts on the balance sheet primarily cash and accounts receivable 
in addition to the revenue  operating expenses and other income expense  net items covered specifically above  there were several additional adjustments also included in these restatement items that were grouped into the other categories given their minimal individual impact 
many of these adjustments include certain errors that were not previously recorded because in each case  and in the aggregate  the underlying errors were not considered by management to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
all the items identified above generally affect the timing pattern of revenue  expense and income recognition 
as such  they do not generally change the cumulative revenues  expenses  pre tax operating income  liquidity or cash flow of the company

table of contents overview our company and business model quest software  inc delivers innovative products that help it organizations get more performance from their computing environment 
our product areas are application management  database management and windows management 
the focus of our products is based upon generating higher levels of performance  manageability and productivity throughout our customers it infrastructure and with products and services that enable them to manage the investments they have made within their it environment 
our initial core competency as a database management company was built upon deep expertise within the oracle database platform where we assembled a portfolio of products to manage and speed the development on the platform 
as customers required heterogeneous database management tools  we broadened our product portfolio to deliver complementary solutions and expanded our offerings to address other database platforms  including db and sql server 
today  most of our database management revenue is derived from products focused on the oracle platform 
in the last several years however  oracle has increased the functionality of their database products creating a stronger competitive offering which has impaired our license growth for certain products 
this has negatively impacted our database management product growth 
on the other hand  our database development product group led by toad  continues to be the most significant revenue contributor of our oracle database products 
in early oracle introduced sql developer  a free tool which competes with toad 
while toad distinguishes itself as a feature rich heterogeneous database platform tool  we invested in sales and marketing resources to broaden our customer footprint with toad and strengthen our feature set of this key product 
while doing this we simultaneously sought to stimulate our broader database driven product revenues by placing more emphasis on the sql server database  a microsoft product 
given the rapid growth of sql server within the market  our strategy has been to foster continued development on this platform and to build increased management capabilities into our offerings in support of the platform 
while databases typically front large application deployments  they logically interact with other elements of the application infrastructure 
this logical linkage and reliance on the database led quest into its next product focal point known as application management 
from our acquisition of foglight software in january and then sitraka in october  to our current offerings for application management  we have made significant investments in developing and supporting products for this market 
foglight remains our flagship product and largest revenue component of our application management offerings 
as our customers face the need to manage more complex applications with service oriented architectures  our products for identifying application outages and performance have become important tools 
much of was an investment year for our application management products 
our r d team was focused on developing the next version of foglight by reconstructing the product  integrating the previously acquired sitraka technology and other end user aspects into an integrated solution which was brought to market during after establishing a market presence in both the database and application management markets  we sought to broaden our portfolio further into the windows management tools market in early with our acquisition of fastlane technologies 
in  we acquired aelita software 
our acquisition of aelita  combined with internally developed products  solidified our position as one of microsoft s leading isv s 
we market and support management tools for three key microsoft platforms active directory  exchange and sql server  and our products address both migration and management of the windows platform 
our migration business comprises a set of products which support migration from other competitive platforms to its comparable microsoft platform  as well as migrations from earlier to the most current version of microsoft platforms 
in addition  we offer products which complement the core platform tools which are natively used by customers to manage these platforms once they are in a production environment 
as our windows products emerged and continued to grow in market popularity  the composition of our overall revenue profile changed from being primarily derived from the oracle database platform tools to a more balanced profile with our windows products 
during  as most large scale migrations were completed earlier  the primary driver of our revenue growth shifted from our migration products to the management group of products in our windows portfolio 
the management portfolio was bolstered in with products acquired through vintela and imceda which covered sql server and active directory 

table of contents we derive revenues from three primary sources software licenses  post contract technical support services referred to as pcs and professional consulting and training services referred to as pso 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our license fees are typically calculated either on a per server basis or a per seat basis 
pcs contracts entitle a customer to telephone or internet support and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year pcs contracts are typically sold with the related perpetual software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter at the customer s option 
annual pcs renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial customer purchase price which includes both the fee for a perpetual license and first year pcs 
revenue is allocated to first year pcs based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months although at times we sell pcs with terms of greater than months 
over the last few years revenues generated by our pcs offerings have become a larger contributor to the total revenue base of the company 
as our pcs customer base grows  the pcs renewal rate has a larger influence on the pcs revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect 
therefore  the growth rate of total revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of changes in our pcs revenue profile is the rate at which our customers renew their annual maintenance and support agreements 
if our pcs renewal rates were to decline materially  our pcs revenues and total revenues would likely decline materially as well 
although we do not currently expect our pcs renewal rates to deteriorate  there can be no assurance they will not 
we also provide pso services which relate to installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
revenue is allocated to pso services based on vsoe of fair value and recognized as the services are performed 
such revenues represent  and of total services revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
our primary expenses are our personnel costs  which include compensation  benefits and payroll related taxes  which are a function of our world wide headcount 
we estimate that these personnel related costs represented approximately of total expenses in our headcount at the end of fiscal was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of fiscal total stock based compensation expense increased from million in to million in  representing a year over year increase  primarily because of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
we invest heavily in research and development in order to design  develop and enhance a wide variety of products and technologies 
we have also maintained an approach of using acquisitions as a strategy to obtain incremental products and technology that will be attractive to our customers 
in addition  we are primarily a direct sales driven organization that expends significant selling costs in order to secure new customer license sales and the follow on pcs revenue stream that can continue forward beyond the initial license sale 
our foreign currency gains or losses are predominantly attributable to translation gains or losses on our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries  including accounts receivable and cash  which were primarily denominated in the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound and canadian dollar 
the foreign currency translation adjustments to these balance sheet items are calculated by comparing the currency spot rates at the end of a quarter to the spot rates at the end of the previous quarter 
on this basis  we recorded  in other income expense  net  a net gain of million in and a net loss of million in  representing a year over year change of 
while currency fluctuations between and significantly impacted our other income expense  net  foreign currency exchange rates did not materially affect our income from operations in the impact of currency rate changes was less than on our income from operations  meaning the strengthening foreign currencies increased revenues and expenses by less than each in our results as discussed in more detail throughout our md a from to  total revenues increased to million and total expenses increased to million  resulting in operating margin of 
income from operations increased from million to million and net income increased from million to million 

table of contents our windows management products were the primary product contributors to revenue growth from to our database development product family also contributed significantly to total revenues and revenue growth in total revenues from our north american operations increased by million  or  while total revenues from the rest of world operations increased by million  or 
sales of perpetual software licenses and services from acquired company products products from our acquisitions of imceda  vintela  vizioncore  xaffire  and aftermail were significant contributors to revenue growth in the contribution from these acquired products to our total revenue growth in was approximately million or 
results of operations from all acquisitions are included in our consolidated income statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
for more information concerning our acquisitions during the periods presented herein  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally perpetual software licenses and which portions must be deferred generally pcs and pso 
in addition  we analyze various factors including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us make judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and the related technical practice aids of the aicpa 
in accordance with sop  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we deliver the products  fees are fixed or determinable and license agreement terms are free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that they may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
we initially capture value for our products by selling a perpetual software license to end customers 
the fee for the first year of pcs is included in  or bundled with  the perpetual software license at the time of initial sale 
as such  the combination at initial sale of a perpetual software license and one year of pcs represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
when all four of our revenue recognition criteria are met the multiple element aspect of our arrangements means the only revenue recognized upfront  at the time of initial sale  is the residual revenue allocated to the perpetual software license 
the revenue associated with the fair value of the undelivered pcs and or pso included in the initial sale is deferred and is subsequently recorded to revenue ratably over the support term and as such services are performed  respectively 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on vsoe of fair value 

table of contents revenue for our standalone sale of annual pcs renewals in years two  three and beyond is recognized ratably over the support term 
sales of pcs for multiple annual periods are treated similarly 
revenue from our pso is generally recognized as professional services are performed in accordance with the underlying service contracts 
our pcs vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the prices our end customers pay for this support when it is sold separately  that is  when we enter into an arms length  annual renewal transaction with end customers where the only offering sold is pcs 
these standalone pcs renewal transactions are typically for one year in duration and are priced as a targeted percentage of the initial  discounted purchase price which includes both the upfront license fee and the first year of pcs 
we bill these pcs renewal transactions in advance of the services provided 
we also offer end customers the right to purchase pcs for multiple annual periods at discounted prices beyond the first year as they will be paying cash upfront  well in advance of the multi year services performed 
our pso vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to our established pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
our pso are typically sold as time and materials based contracts that range from five to fifteen days in duration 
we sell pso both standalone and as part of multiple element arrangements 
our vsoe of fair value is impacted by estimates and judgments that  if significantly different  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
these estimates and judgments include  among other items the ability to identify and validate vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements via the use of sampling techniques  the impact on sampling results of customer negotiating pressure on renewal rates  the impact on sampling results of pcs renewals on deals originally sold via indirect channels  the fair value of that undelivered element for sampled transactions  and where a customer s pcs renewal is in its product life cycle when numerous year s renewal efforts have been combined into one transaction a co term 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe of fair value for pcs and pso but we may modify our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
this could result in changes to our vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this were to occur  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements would differ significantly from our historical results 
if we were unable to support at all through vsoe the fair value of our pcs or pso  the entire amount of revenue from our initial  upfront sale of both a perpetual software license bundled with one year of pcs and any pso would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element hardware  software  specific upgrade rights  etc 
in a bundled software and services arrangement  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services are performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses each year wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive pcs for a defined period of time 
approximately of license revenue was generated by these time based software licenses 
all license and support revenues on these term licenses are deferred and recognized ratably over the license term 
we license our products primarily through our direct sales force  our telesales force and  increasingly  indirect channels including value added resellers and distributors 
for our direct sales  we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions upon which our products and services are sold to our end customers 
for our indirect sales  we accept orders from our resellers and distributors when we are informed that they have existing orders from an end customer 
we utilize written contracts coupled with purchase orders as the means to establish the terms and conditions of these indirect sales transactions 

table of contents indirect sales through resellers  which are a growing proportion of our transaction volume  are generally handled via processes and policies that are similar to an end customer sale 
our practice until january  was to defer revenue recognition on indirect sales transactions of significant size until receipt of payment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria had been satisfied as collectability was not reasonably assured 
because of a change in circumstances involving improved cash collection histories with certain resellers we modified our revenue recognition practices to recognize revenue upon delivery of the software when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
the modified practice  which now allows for the earlier recognition on most of our reseller transactions  has been implemented effective january  substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
since such acceptance provisions are not contained in our software license arrangements as standard provisions and the incidence of returns in accordance with such acceptance provisions cannot be reasonably estimated  if a contract does include such a provision we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that cancellation is not likely  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other requirements have been met 
our standard payment terms are days but may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
we generally deem payments that are due within months to be fixed and determinable based on collections history and thereby satisfy the required revenue recognition criteria 
for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for sales returns and cancellations as well as an allowance for bad debt 
regarding our allowance for sales returns and cancellations  our standard form license and pcs and or service agreements do not typically or expressly provide for product returns or cancellations as a matter of right unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established written specifications 
however  we maintain the sales returns and cancellations allowance to cover the circumstances where the company accepts returns or cancellations on a discretionary basis even though not contractually obligated to do so 
this allowance also covers estimated losses for our customer s unwillingness to make required payments 
the allowance for bad debt is for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments related to enforceable contracts 
to support both these allowances  we are required to make significant estimates of future software license returns  of cancellations for both pcs and of pso  and of write offs of customer accounts as bad debts all related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on these estimates  the contractual terms and conditions of our contracts  our accounts receivable aging and our historical collection experience with a customer base 
if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
while such return  cancellation and bad debt write off amounts have historically been within our planned expectations and the allowances established we cannot guarantee that our sales returns and allowances will be adequate to cover future performance issues of our customer base and allowances may be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of and determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach and income approach were the methodologies deemed the most reliable and were the primary methods used for our impairment analysis 
we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews could result in significant charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 

table of contents amortizing intangible assets these assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and include technology  customer lists  maintenance contracts  trademarks and non compete agreements acquired and are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we make estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  acquired company key personnel s willingness and ability to compete  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the net carrying amount of amortizing intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
investments in non consolidated companies all of our investments in non consolidated companies are currently accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist when we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements  are also typically considered in determining the appropriate accounting treatment 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies and  as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes but is not limited to a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes  and impacts from competitive pressures 
if we determine that the carrying value of our investment in a company is at an amount below fair value  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a significant amount of judgment  estimation and uncertainty and our estimate of income taxes can be highly sensitive to shifts between such tax jurisdictions 
additionally  our us and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that could result from the examination of our tax returns 
determining the income tax expense for such contingencies requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
we evaluate such tax contingencies in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
these estimates are updated over time as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statutes of limitation  or upon occurrence of other events 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such contingencies could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the tax contingency accrual is recorded as a component of our net income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
those earnings are considered permanently reinvested 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas accordingly  we recognized compensation expense for stock option grants where the exercise price was lower than the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we provided pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share disclosures for each period prior to the adoption of sfas r  as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our stock based compensation plans 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method 
as required by sfas r  we estimate forfeitures of employee stock options and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
forfeiture rates are determined based on historical experience 
estimated forfeitures are adjusted to actual forfeiture experience as needed 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation expense recognized during the twelve months ended december  includes a compensation expense for all stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all stock based awards granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the recognition provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended december  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits the apic pool  available as of january   to absorb tax deficiencies recognized in subsequent periods  assuming we had applied the provisions of the standard in prior periods 
we applied the provisions of sfas r in calculating the apic pool  which was calculated using the long haul method 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
we may use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
see also restatement of previously issued financial statements above and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion of the restatement related to our stock option grants 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to re measure the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their local currency into united states dollars 
this process results in foreign currency re measurement gains and losses included in other income expense  net in the consolidated income statements 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these re measurement gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including transfer pricing arrangements  billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is one consideration of determining the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
other income expense  net includes any gain or loss associated with the re measurement of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the united states dollar 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements into the united states dollar would be included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the local currency  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
as a result of this determination  assets and liabilities in these subsidiaries are re measured at current exchange rates  except for property and equipment and deferred revenue  which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are re measured at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the 
table of contents year except for revenue and costs related to the above mentioned balance sheet items which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
accordingly  we had a net foreign currency re measurement gain of million  a net loss of million and a net gain of million for the years ended december   and  respectively  recorded to other income expense  net in the respective periods 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the local currency  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our statement of shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
the company operates in a number of currencies worldwide  most notably in the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and russian ruble 
any future re measurement gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets

cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
marketable securities consisted primarily of short term investment grade bonds and united states government and agency securities with original maturities of greater than three months 
our investment objectives were to preserve principal and provide liquidity  while at the same time maximizing market return without significantly increasing risk 
we generally hold investments in marketable securities until maturity 
summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our primary source of operating cash flows was the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our primary use of cash from operating activities was for compensation and personnel related expenditures 
we intend to continue to fund our operating expenses through cash flows from operations 
the analyses of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities are as follows accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to an increase in daily sales  which resulted in an increase in operating assets  reflecting a use of cash of million for the twelve months ended december  the remaining change in accounts receivable of million  relating to the impact of non cash foreign currency translation adjustments  is presented as part of the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
day s sales outstanding dso was approximately days as of both december  and  and our daily sales increased to million for the quarter ended december  compared to million for the quarter ended december  collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our revenues and their linearity and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
deferred revenue increased in each period resulting in an increase in operating liabilities  reflecting a cash inflow of million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
the increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to growth in our software pcs customer base 
the primary cash outflow within operating assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended december  was million paid for taxes 
the timing of these tax payments resulted in an increase in income taxes payable  reflecting a cash inflow of million for the twelve months ended december  the primary cash outflow within operating assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended december  was million paid for taxes and million related to a litigation settlement 
we made no such litigation payment during the timing of tax payments resulted in an increase in income taxes payable  reflecting a cash inflow of million for the twelve months ended december  the remaining net cash inflow for the twelve months ended december  of million was related to changes in our other operating asset and liability accounts see our consolidated statements of cash flows included with this report 
investing activities our primary source of investing cash flows was proceeds from the sale of marketable securities  typically at maturity 
our primary uses of cash from investing activities were for purchases of marketable securities  cash payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 

table of contents capital expenditures in included million for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for the lease of our new emea headquarters office in maidenhead  united kingdom 
we completed the sale of our corporate aircraft to a third party in for million in cash  net of million in transaction fees 
capital expenditures during the twelve months ended december  and included million and million  respectively  in cash to complete the purchase of our buildings in aliso viejo  california and related infrastructure improvements 
we did not have such expenditures in in we used million in cash to acquire two companies and to make minority cost method investments in three early stage private companies 
in we used million in cash related to five acquisitions 
in we used million in cash related to three acquisitions offset by million in cash provided by the sale of our vista plus product suite 
these acquisitions and disposition are more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to purchase property and equipment needed in the normal course of our business 
we also plan to use cash generated from operations and or proceeds from investments in marketable securities to fund other strategic investment and acquisition opportunities that we continue to evaluate 
we plan to use excess cash generated from operations to invest in short and long term marketable securities consistent with past investment practices 
financing activities our primary source of financing cash flows has historically been from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock option plans  excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation and proceeds from a repurchase agreement 
we have also financed acquisitions and capital expenditures with net borrowings under a repurchase agreement in prior periods 
excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation were historically reported under net cash provided by operating activities but  under sfas r going forward these amounts are required to be classified as a cash flow from financing activity 
excess tax benefits in years prior to adoption of sfas r were presented in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows and were million and million in and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  cash flows from financing activities were affected by proceeds from and repayment of our repurchase agreement as more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we announced our determination to restate our previously issued financial statements and have become delinquent in our periodic reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  we determined that we could no longer rely upon the registration statements on form s previously filed with the us securities exchange commission to register the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options granted under our various stock option plans 
accordingly  we took action in the third quarter of to block exercises of all stock options based on our determination that doing so was necessary to prevent violations of applicable securities law and as a result  we do not expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of stock options until after all of our delinquent reports are filed with the sec 
we completed our repatriation activity under the american jobs creation act ajca during this effort resulted in the tax efficient  one time return of million cash for funding acquisitions  purchase of real property  funding for research and development related activities and infrastructure and capital investments 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next to months 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption risk factors 
one of these risks is that our future business does not stay at a level that is similar to  or better than  our recent past 
should a general economic downturn or similar event occur  or should the company s products become uncompetitive or less attractive to end customers  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to support our working capital and other cash requirements 
also  acquisitions are an important part of our business model 
as such  significant amounts of cash could and will likely be used in the future for additional acquisitions or strategic investments 
if additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements  acquisitions or other purposes  we may seek to raise funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
we can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment 
in addition  we are committed to pay additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million as capital calls are made 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that could reduce our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  and the effect we expect such obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the cash commitments above  we have certain rights and obligations in the form of call and put options  the amount and likelihood of which are not currently determinable  to acquire the remaining equity interest in two entities for a purchase price to be determined by a formula that is based on multiples of revenue 
we also entered into earn out agreements with the shareholders of companies we acquired during the year ended december  the earn out payments are based on the acquired company s products total revenue growth over a specified period after the acquisition date 
no earn out payments were required to be paid in and the amount or likelihood of future payments based on future results is not determinable 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are a us dollar functional company and transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to both transaction and translation risk relating to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is composed of the combination of our foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses depending on the directional movement of the foreign currencies versus the us dollar and our operational profile in foreign subsidiaries 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and low correlation between different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
during  we had a million foreign currency gain compared to a million foreign currency loss in the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost and benefits of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time 
interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states government and its agencies 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade bonds and united states government and agency securities 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
we presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long term investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates 
however  in the event that we did liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there were no changes in market interest rates  we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate 
at december   we have an unrealized loss of million on our investments in debt securities compared to million at december  our remaining investment positions and duration of the portfolio would not be materially affected by a basis point shift in interest rates 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  thereafter total portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents of million
