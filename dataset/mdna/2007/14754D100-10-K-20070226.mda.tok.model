critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
loan transactions may conclude based upon redemption  renewal  or forfeiture of the loan collateral 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn 
table of contents loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was over estimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease by million in and net income would decrease by million 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or market 
management provides an allowance for shrinkage and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  and include the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance  which was million  representing of the balance of merchandise held for disposition at december  adverse changes in the disposition value of the company s merchandise may require an increase in the valuation allowance 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on company owned cash advances including fees and interest and accrues losses for third party lender owned cash advances at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance product primarily serves a customer base of non prime borrowers 
these advances are typically single payment cash advances with a typical term of seven to days 
cash advances written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding portfolio by age  delinquency and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
the company uses current portfolio performance  the performance of cash advances made twelve months ago and portfolio collection history to develop expected loss rates used in determining the allowance 
increased defaults and credit losses  which could occur during a national or regional economic downturn or for other reasons  could require an increase in the allowance 
since cash advances are unsecured  unlike pawn loans  the portfolio s performance depends on the company s ability to collect on defaulted loans 
the company believes it effectively manages the risks inherent in this product by utilizing a variety of underwriting criteria to evaluate prospective borrowers  maintaining a customer database to track individual borrowers performance and by closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio 
any remaining unpaid balance of a cash advance is charged off once it has been in default for days or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
at december   allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned cash advances were million  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision for the combined cash advance portfolio  which increases the allowance for loan losses  was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party lenders 
if future loss rates increased  or decreased  by from levels  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million 
table of contents and net income would decrease  or increase  by million  assuming the same volume of cash advances written in valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on company estimates of capital gains expected to be recognized during the period over which the capital losses may be used to offset such gains 
if the company were to determine that it could not realize all or part of its other net deferred tax assets in the future  it would have to charge an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it could in the future realize its deferred tax assets in an amount exceeding the net recorded amount  it could adjust the deferred tax assets to reduce the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination was made 
recently issued accounting standards in june  financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
it requires that the new standard be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the period of adoption and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is evaluating the potential effect of fin  but does not expect it to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
it establishes a fair value hierarchy and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in both interim and annual periods 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect sfas to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations  but anticipates additional disclosures when it becomes effective

table of contents overview components of consolidated net revenue 
consolidated net revenue is total revenue reduced by the cost of merchandise sold in the period 
it represents the income available to satisfy expenses and is the measure management uses to evaluate top line performance 
the components of consolidated net revenue are pawn related net revenue  consisting of finance and service charges from pawn loans plus profit from the disposition of merchandise  cash advance fees and other revenue which is comprised mostly of check cashing fees but includes royalties and other revenue items 
growth in cash advance fees has increased the related contribution of the cash advance products to consolidated net revenue during each of the three years of  and the growth in cash advance fees is primarily attributable to higher average balances owed by customers  the addition of new units and the recent addition of cash advances made over the internet beginning in mid september of while lower as a percent of total net revenue  pawn related net revenue remains the largest component of net revenue at  and for  and  respectively 
management believes that the inclusion of the online cash advance business for a full twelve months in will cause cash advance fees to be the largest component of net revenue next year 
the following graphs show consolidated net revenue and depicts the mix of the components of net revenue for the years ended december   and million million million pie chart pie chart pie chart 
table of contents contribution to increase in net revenue cash advance fees  including cash advance fees generated in pawn lending locations  have increased primarily because of higher average balances owed by customers  the growth and development of newly opened cash advance locations and the recent addition of cash advances made over the internet

table of contents finance and service charges 
finance and service charges from pawn loans increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to higher pawn loan balances attributable to an increased amount of pawn loans written 
an increase in the average balance of pawn loans outstanding contributed million of the increase that was offset by a million decrease resulting from the lower annualized yield of the pawn loan portfolio which is a function of the blend in permitted rates for fees and service charges on pawn loans in all operating locations of the company and slightly lower redemption rates 
finance and service charges from same stores stores that have been open for at least twelve months increased million  or  in compared to the average balances of pawn loans outstanding were higher in than in the increase in the average balance of pawn loans outstanding was driven by a increase in the average amount per loan that was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of pawn loans outstanding during management believes this decrease could be related to the fact that higher advance rates on loans secured by gold collateral  such as jewelry  can allow customers to reduce the number of loans needed to achieve their needs 
pawn loan balances at december  were million  which was higher than at december  annualized loan yield was in  compared to in same store pawn loan balances at december  were million  or  higher than at december  profit from the disposition of merchandise

overall gross profit margin decreased slightly from in to in excluding the effect of the disposition of refined gold  the profit margin on the disposition of merchandise including jewelry sales decreased to in from in the profit margin on the disposition of refined gold increased to in from in primarily due to higher prevailing market prices of gold  which in turn caused the hedge adjusted selling price per ounce to increase in compared to the company also experienced an increase in the volume of refined gold sold during  which is generally in line with the increase in pawn loan balances for the period 
proceeds from disposition of merchandise  excluding refined gold  increased million  or  in primarily due to the net addition of pawnshop locations and to the higher levels of retail sales activity that was supported by higher levels of merchandise available for disposition entering into the consolidated merchandise turnover rate was times in both and management expects that profit margin on the disposition of merchandise in the near term will likely remain at or slightly below current levels mainly due to higher inventory levels and an increase in the percentage of refined gold sales  which typically have lower gross profit margins

in march  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued revised guidelines affecting certain short term cash advance products offered by fdic regulated banks 
the revised guidance applied to the cash advance product that was offered by third party banks in many of the company s locations 
the revised guidance  which became effective july   restricted banks from providing cash advances to customers for more than three months out of a twelve month period 
in order to address the short term credit needs of customers who no longer had access to the banks cash advance product  the company began offering an alternative short term credit product in selected markets in on july   the company introduced a credit services organization program the cso program 
under the 
table of contents cso program  the company acts as a credit services organization on behalf of consumers in accordance with applicable state laws 
credit services that the company provides to its customers include arranging loans with independent third party lenders  assisting in the preparation of loan applications and loan documents  and accepting loan payments at the location where the loans were arranged 
to assist the customer in obtaining a loan from a third party lender through the cso program  the company  on behalf of its customer  guarantees the customer s payment obligations under the loan to the third party lender 
a cso program customer pays the company a cso fee for the credit services  including the guaranty  and enters into a contract with the company governing the credit services arrangement 
the company is responsible for losses on cash advances assigned to or acquired by it under its guaranty 
at december   the company offered the cso program in texas  florida and  on a limited basis  michigan 
as a result of the revised fdic guidelines  the company elected to discontinue offering third party bank originated cash advances to michigan customers in july  and to consumers in texas  florida and north carolina in january consumer demand for bank originated cash advances in michigan  florida and texas was effectively satisfied by replacing the bank originated cash advance program in those states with the cso program instituted by the company in july the company discontinued the cso program in michigan in february  and now offers only cash advances underwritten by the company to customers in that state 
during the third quarter of  the company ceased offering single payment cash advances originated by third party banks in california and began offering company originated cash advances under applicable state law 
as an additional service alternative to its customers  during the fourth quarter of the company introduced third party commercial bank originated multi payment installment cash advances in california and georgia 
the company discontinued offering multi payment bank products in georgia during the second quarter of and in california during july due principally to its third party commercial banks response to concerns that the fdic raised to fdic supervised banks in late february regarding the fdic s perception of risks associated with fdic supervised banks origination of certain cash advance products with the assistance of third party marketers and servicers 
these changes had the effect of lowering the average amount per loan available to customers in california which led to lower levels of cash advance balances in california during the last half of and caused reduced profitability in those locations year over year 
this trend in lower profits in california locations is expected to continue for the first half of unless offset by an increase in demand and higher balances outstanding 
management anticipates continued growth in consolidated cash advance fees for fiscal due to increased consumer awareness and demand for the cash advance product  higher outstanding balances at december  compared to december   the addition of the internet distribution channel through cashnetusa  the growth of balances from new units opened in  and planned openings in check cashing fees  royalties and other

as a multi unit operator in the consumer finance industry  the company s operations expenses are predominately related to personnel and occupancy expenses 
personnel expenses include base salary and wages  performance incentives  and benefits 
occupancy expenses include rent  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and maintenance 
the combination of personnel and occupancy expenses represents of total operations expenses in and in the comparison is as follows in thousands of of revenue revenue personnel occupancy other total the increase in personnel expenses is mainly due to unit additions since  an increase in staffing levels  including at the collection centers  the acquisition of cashnetusa and normal recurring salary adjustments 
the increase in occupancy expense is primarily due to unit additions  higher utility costs and property taxes 
administration expenses 
consolidated administration expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  were in compared to in the components of administration expenses are as follows in thousands of of revenue revenue personnel other total the increase in administration expenses was principally attributable to increased staffing levels consistent with the company s expansion into new markets and the internet distribution channels and an increase in accrued management incentive in conjunction with the financial performance of the company compared to its business plan 
the increase in these expenses was partially offset by a gain of  recognized from a partial insurance settlement in related to hurricanes in cash advance loss provision 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on cash advances at a level projected to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance loss provision is utilized to increase the allowance carried against the outstanding company owned cash advance portfolio as well as expected losses in the third party lender owned portfolios which are guaranteed by the company 
the allowance is based on historical trends in portfolio performance based on the status of the balance owed by the customer with the full amount of the customer s obligations being completely reserved when they become days past due 
the cash advance loss provision increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was mainly attributable to the increased volume of cash advances written which was partially offset by a million decrease as a result of lower loss rates 
the loss provision as a percentage of cash advance fees increased to in from in going forward management believes that this ratio 
table of contents could increase as the composition mix of the portfolio becomes more heavily weighted to cash advances from online customers which historically have resulted in higher loss rates than customers receiving loans in lending locations 
total charge offs less recoveries divided by total cash advances written decreased in to compared to in the decrease was partially related to underwriting changes made in late which resulted in lower loss rates which offset the reduction in year over year growth rates in cash advances written in compared to prior years 
the loss provision expense as a percentage of cash advances written was higher in  increasing to compared to in the prior year mostly due to a significant increase in cash advance receivable balances as of year end and the inclusion of the cash advance balance from online customers which carry a higher expected loss rate

there are two additional measurement dates in  march and september to the extent that the defined multiple of consolidated earnings attributable to cashnetusa s business exceeds the total amounts paid through those dates  as defined in the asset purchase agreement  the company will make additional payments to the sellers 
at this time management cannot accurately estimate the magnitude of such payments due to the uncertainties of growth rates in this business

the company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements 
a significant decline in demand for the company s products and services may cause the company to reduce its planned level of capital expenditures and lower its working capital needs in order to maintain compliance with the financial ratios in those agreements 
an uncured violation of the credit agreements could result in an acceleration of the company s debt and increase the company s borrowing costs and could even adversely affect the company s ability to renew existing credit facilities  or obtain access to new credit facilities in the future 
the company does not anticipate a significant decline in demand for its services and has historically been successful in maintaining compliance with and renewing its debt agreements

as of december   the cso program was available to consumers in of the company s lending locations located in the states of michigan  florida and texas and online to borrowers in florida and texas 
when a consumer executes a credit services agreement with the company  the company agrees  for a fee payable to the company by the consumer  to provide a variety of credit services to the consumer  one of which is to guarantee the consumer s obligation to repay the loan received by the consumer from the third party lender if the consumer fails to do so 
the company discontinued the cso program in michigan in february  and now offers only cash advances underwritten by the company to customers in that state

at december   the outstanding amount of active cash advances originated by third party lenders was million 
since the company may not be successful in collection of these delinquent accounts  the company s cash advance loss provision includes amounts estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses from cash advances in the aggregate cash advance portfolio  including those expected to be assigned to the company or acquired by the company as a result of its guaranty obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate cap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
in  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million of the company s outstanding floating rate line of credit for a term of months at a fixed libor rate of 
this interest rate cap agreement was perfectly effective at december  the company had net variable rate borrowings outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rates on million of the net variable rate borrowings at december  and  respectively  were capped at 
if prevailing interest rates were to increase basis points over the rates at december  and  respectively  and the variable rate borrowings outstanding remained constant  the company s interest expense would increase by  and  and net income after taxes would decrease by  and  in and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to decrease basis points from the rates at december  and  respectively  the combined fair values of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt million and million  respectively would increase by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
gold price risk 
the company periodically uses forward sale contracts with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of refined gold produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of forfeited gold merchandise 
a significant decrease in the price of gold would result in a reduction of proceeds from the disposition of refined gold to the extent that amounts sold were in excess of the amount of contracted forward sales 
in addition  a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of some of the goods pledged as collateral by customers and identified for liquidation as refined gold 
in this instance  management believes some customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount 
however  those customers unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral would receive lower loan amounts  possibly resulting in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company 
foreign exchange risk 
the notes receivable received in the sale of the company s foreign operations are subject to the risk of unexpected change in swedish kronor exchange rates 
as a result of fluctuations in swedish kronor  the company recorded foreign currency transaction gains of  including a loss of million on the foreign currency forward contracts and loss of  net of a gain of  on the foreign currency forward contracts in and  respectively 
as a result of the establishment of 
table of contents the million swedish kronor currency forward contracts since mid year to minimize the effect of market fluctuations  substantially all of the impact of a potential decline in the exchange rate of the swedish kronor would be offset by the gains realized on those forward contracts 
a hypothetical decline in the exchange rate of the swedish kronor at december  would have decreased net income by
