upholstery fabrics sales represented approximately of total sales for fiscal  down from in fiscal upholstery fabric yards sold during fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  a decline of 
average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal the lower sales reflect continued soft demand industry wide for us produced fabrics  driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported fabrics  including an increasing amount of cut and sewn kits 
sales of us produced fabrics for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal  a decrease of 
in fiscal  the company continued to source and market upholstery fabrics produced internationally  primarily in china 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet consumer preferences for certain types of fabrics  as well as to serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding furniture production in international areas 
as a result of the company s production and offshore sourcing efforts  including its china platform  the company is experiencing higher sales of upholstery fabric produced outside the us than from its us manufacturing plants 
the china platform has continued to grow  although at a slower rate 
sales of non us produced fabrics are beginning to reflect the overall softness in the furniture industry 
for fiscal  these sales increased from fiscal and accounted for million  or of upholstery fabric sales  in fiscal sales of fabric produced offshore was million  or of upholstery fabric sales for fiscal a major component of the company s offshore business is its china operation  which began manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  just over three years ago 
this initiative involves a strategy to link the company s existing customer relationships  design expertise and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturing in china  while continuing to maintain high quality standards 
the company is currently leasing four facilities in the shanghai region of china  where fabrics sourced in china are inspected and tested to assure compliance with the company s quality standards before shipment to its customers 
in many cases  additional value added finishing steps are applied to the fabrics in china before shipment 
the company s offshore business represents a significant growth opportunity in an increasing global furniture and fabrics market place

over the past several years  the company has revamped its us upholstery fabric product strategy by offering a more select group of attractively priced  high volume decorative and velvet fabrics that are well packaged by color and coordination  utilizing an increasing amount of lower cost imported yarns 
over this time period  the company has significantly reduced stock keeping units  or skus  of lower volume products that do not fit the company s us operating model 
as a result  the company has reduced its product complexity going forward 
along with this shift in product strategy  the company has taken aggressive steps to reduce its us manufacturing costs and capacity and employment levels to align its operations with current demand 
as of the end of fiscal  the company has one remaining us upholstery fabrics plant in anderson  south carolina which produces velvets and a limited amount of decorative fabrics 
culp is now the only remaining us company producing velvet fabrics for furniture manufacturers and we believe the anderson plant will continue to play an important role in our upholstery fabrics business 
the carrying value of our us upholstery fabrics fixed asset base was million at april  non us produced sales sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside the company s us manufacturing operations  including fabrics produced at our china facility  were up in fiscal compared to fiscal and accounted for approximately of upholstery fabric sales for fiscal management believes that the development of its china platform represents a significant growth opportunity for the company 
as the company s us customers have continued to move an increasing amount of their fabric purchases to asia  the company has moved with them and responded with an operation designed to meet their needs 
a key component of this platform is the fabric finishing and inspection facility located near shanghai 
a key element of the company s strategy is to control the value added finishing and inspection process  thereby assuring customers that the company s fabrics will meet or exceed us quality standards 
us produced sales as previously discussed  management has continued to take very aggressive actions over the past year to bring us manufacturing costs and capacity in line with current and expected demand trends 
as a result of these activities  the company now has one us manufacturing facility operating in the upholstery fabrics segment

while management believes it is important to produce some level of upholstery fabric in the us to support its customers domestic fabric requirements  management remains committed to take additional steps if necessary to address the profitability of the company s us upholstery fabric operations

critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and million from bedding manufacturers 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was million and million at april  and april   respectively 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
long lived assets 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an impairment accounting model for long lived assets to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of by abandonment or other means 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in fiscal  the company prepared an impairment evaluation on its upholstery fabrics segment due to continued adverse business results requiring further restructuring 
the company s assessment indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of this segment was sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets to be held and used 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions  future sales and profitability  and future asset utilization 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions  or a decision to dispose of substantial portions of these assets  could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that  at least annually  goodwill be retested for impairment 
as of april   the company s remaining million of goodwill relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
in fiscal  due to lower than expected operating profits and cash flow in the upholstery fabrics segment  management determined that the remaining goodwill associated with this segment should be tested for impairment 
an independent business valuation specialist was engaged to assist the company in the valuation 
as a result of this valuation  the company recorded in its second quarter of fiscal a goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes  or per share diluted 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
restructuring charges 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain employee termination benefits that qualify under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the upholstery fabric segment continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and scale us productive capacity in line with current and expected demand trends  the company has undertaken restructuring initiatives during the past several years 
these restructuring initiatives have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities 
severance and related charges are accrued at the date the restructuring was approved by the board of directors based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees  in accordance with sfas under sfas  asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
other exit costs  which principally consist of charges for lease termination and losses from termination of existing contracts  equipment relocation costs and inventory markdowns that are related to the restructuring are accounted for in accordance with sfas the company reassesses the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at april   the company had deferred tax assets of million all of which are related to u s 
operations and deferred tax liabilities of million  resulting in net deferred tax assets of million 
the us deferred tax liabilities total million all of which reverse in the carry forward period  resulting in net u 
s 
deferred tax assets of million 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
in making the judgment about the realization of the deferred tax assets  management has considered both negative and positive evidence  and concluded that sufficient positive evidence exists to overcome the cumulative losses experienced in recent years 
specifically  management considered the following  among other factors nature of the company s products  history of positive earnings in the mattress fabrics segment  capital projects that have been completed to further enhance the company s globally competitive cost structure in the mattress fabrics segment  recent significant restructuring actions in the domestic upholstery fabrics business to adjust the domestic cost structure and bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand  and development of offshore manufacturing and sourcing programs to meet changing demands of upholstery fabric customers in the us management s analysis of taxable income also included the following considerations none of the company s net operating loss carryforwards has previously expired unused  the us federal carryforward period is years  and the company s current losses principally expire in years  fiscal through considerable judgment is involved in this process and the ultimate realization of benefits is dependent on the generation of taxable income from future us operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no

will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement in the united states and its real estate term loans 
as of april   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the company s real estate term loans and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the first real estate term loan  the company entered into a  notional principal interest rate swap agreement  which represents of the principal amount on the first real estate term loan  and effectively converts the floating rate libor based payments to fixed payments at plus the spread calculated under the real estate term loan agreement 
the company s unsecured senior term notes have a fixed interest rate of and the canadian government loans are non interest bearing 
the company s revolving credit agreement associated with its china subsidiary has fixed interest rates ranging from of to 
additionally  approximately of the company s borrowings are at a fixed rate or is non interest bearing 
thus  any foreseeable change in the interest rates would not expect to have a material effect on the company 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are due primarily to foreign subsidiaries domiciled in canada and china 
these subsidiaries use the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with their foreign subsidiaries 
a change in either exchange rate at april  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
