beef we expect to continue building on the operational execution improvements from fiscal  however  the beginning of fiscal has been a very difficult and volatile environment for the industry 
the current environment is the result of the industry processing too much cattle relative to supply and demand  which has a negative impact to operating margins 
historically  these conditions have had a limited duration

fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 which refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 
effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  livestock procurement  securities  environmental  product  taxing authorities and other matters  and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
marketing and advertising costs we incur advertising  retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs 
these programs include cooperative advertising  volume discounts  in store display incentives  coupons and other programs 
marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred 
we accrue costs based on the estimated performance  historical utilization and redemption of each program 
cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products  thus recorded as a reduction to sales 
the remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program 
these estimates are based on many factors  including experience of similar promotional programs 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in our marketing accruals at september   would impact pretax earnings by approximately million 
tyson foods  inc 
effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions accrued self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare  workers compensation  auto liability and general liability claims 
we use an independent third party actuary to assist in the determination of our self insurance liability 
we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability  including claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability 
our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range 
our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used 
costs to settle our obligations  including legal and healthcare costs  could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change 
incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a increase in the actuarial range at september   would not impact the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability 
a decrease in the actuarial range at september   would result in a gain in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition 
when evaluating long lived assets for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
an impairment is recorded if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset 
we recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal years  and our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset  including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material

effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
for our other intangible assets  if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a decline in market capitalization 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units  generally our operating segments  using various valuation techniques  with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about sales  operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
while estimating the fair value of our beef segment  we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the margins realized since export markets have been restricted due to bse issues 
the fair value estimate for this segment assumes future access to export markets similar to periods prior to bse issues and it includes operating margin assumptions based on long term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef industry 
we estimate the fair value of our beef segment would be in excess of its carrying amount  including goodwill  by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 
other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method and using the present value of future cash flows for patents and in process technology 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years 
at september   we had billion of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
our goodwill is included in the following segments billion chicken billion beef billion pork billion prepared foods as a result of the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  the second step was not necessary 
however  a decline in fair value of our beef segment or a decline in fair value of our chicken segment would have caused the carrying values for these reporting units to be in excess of fair values which would require the second step to be performed 
the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and fair value of other intangible assets  it is possible a material change could occur 
if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the reporting units  we may be required to perform the second step which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill 
our fiscal other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge 
a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment

effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions income taxes we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income 
federal income taxes include an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset 
we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future 
our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances 
however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address certain of these risks  we enter into various derivative transactions as described below 
if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended  is recognized immediately 
additionally  we hold certain positions  primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges 
these positions are marked to market  and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date 
the changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 
the changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities  such as grains  livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations 
as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
however  as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations  any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
could result in volatility in our results of operations 
contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of in market prices as of september   and september   on the fair value of open positions 
the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions 
the following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions 
effect of change in fair value in millions livestock cattle hogs grain natural gas interest rate risk at september   we had fixed rate debt of billion with a weighted average interest rate of 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixed rate debt 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value  resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at september   and million at september  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates 
at september   we had variable rate debt of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates effective at september   and september   would have a minimal effect on interest expense 
foreign currency risk we have non cash foreign exchange gain loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of certain receivable and payable balances 
the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  the european euro  the british pound sterling and the brazilian real 
we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates effective at september   and september   would have a minimal effect on pretax income 
concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables 
our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
at september   and september   approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer 
no other single customer or customer group represents greater than of net accounts receivable
