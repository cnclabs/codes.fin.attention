item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors  or faulty assumptions on our part 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview bluefly  inc is a leading internet retailer that sells over brands of designer apparel  accessories and home furnishings at discounts of up to off of retail value 
we launched our web site in september over the past five years our sales have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of more than  while our gross margin percentage has increased from in to in the recent increase in our margin and sales is the direct result of a new merchandise strategy that we began to implement in spring as part of that strategy we are bringing current season merchandise and the latest fashion trends to our customer for great value 
while there will be some fluctuation in our gross margin percentage from quarter to quarter as we further develop our merchandising and marketing strategy  we believe that we will be able to maintain margins at the current levels 
we believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our business while continuing to provide our customers with the great values that they have become accustomed to 
in an effort to take advantage of this opportunity  we launched a national advertising campaign in  and have continued and expanded upon it in the last eighteen months 
we intend to continuously review the results of the campaign and use the learnings to refine and improve upon our marketing strategy 
our net sales increased over to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our gross margin increased to in from in  in  in and in our gross profit increased by more than to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this growth in gross profit was driven by the increase in net sales  and by the increase in gross margins 
our operating loss increased by over  to  in  from  in total marketing expenses increased by to  for the full year  from  for the full year we increased our spending in marketing excluding staff related costs by to  for the full year  from  for the full year the primary goal of our marketing campaign is to build upon the awareness created by the initial launch of the campaign in fall  both with new customers as well as with our existing customers 
a large portion of the increased marketing expense was a result of the costs associated with our national advertising campaign 
for the first three quarters of  our net sales increased by approximately  and  respectively  as compared to the same periods in in general  we intend to market our business more aggressively than we have in previous years 
this more aggressive growth strategy will cause our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase in the short term  however  we believe that it is a prudent investment in our business given that our margin structure and average order size have historically resulted in a relatively high positive contribution to overhead and marketing on a customer s first order 
our reserve for returns and credit card chargebacks increased to of gross sales for the year ended december  compared to in the increase was primarily caused by a shift in our merchandise mix towards certain product categories that historically have generated higher return rates 
however  we believe that this increase in return rates has been more than offset by the higher gross margins and average order sizes that have been generated by this shift in merchandise mix 
a portion of our inventory includes merchandise that we either purchased with the intention of holding for the appropriate season or were unable to sell in a prior season and have determined to hold for the next selling season  subject in some cases to appropriate mark downs 
in recent years we have increased the amount of inventory purchased on a pack and hold basis in order to take advantage of opportunities in the market 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires expensing of stock options 
as a result  we recorded total share based compensation expenses of  for the year ended december  results for prior periods have not been restated due to the adoption based on the modified prospective approach 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the costs associated with developing and marketing our web site and building our infrastructure  as well as non cash beneficial conversion charges resulting from decreases in the conversion price of our preferred stock of approximately million  and non cash charges of approximately million in connection with the adoption of sfas r 
in order to expand our business  we intend to invest in sales  marketing  merchandising  operations  information systems  site development and additional personnel to support these activities 
therefore  we may continue to incur substantial operating losses 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  this growth may not be sustainable and therefore should not be considered indicative of future performance 
critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns  recoverability of inventories  useful lives of property and equipment  the realization of deferred tax assets  and the calculations related to stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
gross sales consists primarily of revenue from product sales and shipping and handling charges and is net of promotional discounts 
net sales represent gross sales  less provisions for returns  credit card chargebacks  and adjustments for uncollected sales taxes 
revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are met o a customer executes an order 
o the product price and the shipping and handling fee have been determined 
o credit card authorization has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
o the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb task force s emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs eitf no 

provision for returns and doubtful accounts we generally permit returns for any reason within days of the sale 
accordingly  we establish a reserve for estimated future returns and bad debt at the time of shipment based primarily on historical data 
we perform credit card authorizations and check the verification of our customers prior to shipment of merchandise 
however  our future return and bad debt rates could differ from historical patterns  and  to the extent that these rates increase significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories  which consist of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
this valuation requires us to make judgements based on currently available information  about the saleability of such merchandise  the selling price  etc 
based upon this evaluation  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and establish a reserve for such merchandise 
deferred tax valuation allowance we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the period that included the enactment date 
we have assessed the future taxable income and determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation as of january   we adopted sfas r which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past

shipping and handling revenue which is included in net sales increased by to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  revenue from shipping and handling increased at a lower rate than overall revenue  due to the increase in our average order size

cost of sales for the year ended december  totaled  resulting in a gross margin of 
the increase in gross margin was driven by our focus on negotiating better prices with vendors as well as our strategy of selling more in season product  which has more value to our customer and therefore demands higher margins  and the timing of our promotions 
while we believe that we can continue to generate gross margin at or near these levels in the future  we believe that it may be difficult for us to continue to increase the gross margin level at the rate that we have over the past few years 
gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales and gross margin  gross profit increased by over  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  marketing expenses marketing expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  our marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from costs associated with our national advertising campaign which was launched in september

marketing expenses increased by a higher percentage than revenue as a result of the costs associated with our national marketing campaign 
costs in connection with this campaign are being recorded as the magazines and commercials are being released 
as a result  we expect marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase in the short term

e commerce expenses include expenses related to our photo studio  image processing  third party software and web site design 
for the year ended december   this amount increased by approximately as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses as well as increased expenses related to photo shoots 
these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with analytic tools 
the increase was offset partially from economies of scale in our operations and technology expenses  as some of the fixed costs involved in maintaining our web site and processing orders were allocated over a larger number of orders 
one of our goals is to achieve greater economies of scale as our business grows  although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
we plan to continue to invest in all of these areas in the near term in order to grow our business

liquidity and capital resources general at december   we had approximately million in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
working capital at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million committed under the credit facility  leaving approximately million of availability  compared to availability of million at december  we fund our operations through cash on hand  operating cash flow  as well as the proceeds of any equity or debt financing 
operating cash flow is affected by revenue and gross margin levels  as well as return rates 
any deterioration in any of these financial measures would have a negative impact on our liquidity 
total availability under the credit facility is based primarily upon our inventory levels 
in addition  both availability under the credit facility and our operating cash flows are affected by the payment terms that we receive from suppliers and service providers  and the extent to which suppliers require us to request wells fargo to provide credit support under the credit facility 
in some instances  new vendors may require prepayments 
we may also make prepayments in order to open up these new relationships  or to gain access to inventory that would not otherwise be available to us 
in addition  we sometimes make prepayments in connection with our advertising campaign  as in some circumstances we need to pay in advance of production 
as of december   we had approximately  of prepaid inventory and  of prepaid marketing expense on our balance sheet 
our inventory levels as of december  were approximately million higher than at december  the increase in inventory generally reflects a ramp up in connection with our sales growth as well as opportunistic buying of fresh inventory that has not previously been available to us however  the increased inventory level could adversely affect our flexibility in taking advantage of other buying opportunities that may become available in the near term 
on june   we raised million of additional capital through the sale of  shares of our common stock 
we used million of the proceeds from such sale to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on the preferred stock converted by soros in connection with such sale and to payoff the convertible promissory notes held by soros 
the remaining proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our current funds  together with working capital  and operating cash flow  and availability under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
credit facility in july  we entered into a new three year revolving credit facility credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc wells fargo 
pursuant to the credit facility  wells fargo provides us with a revolving loan and issues letters of credit in favor of suppliers or factors 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets 
historically  the credit facility had also been secured by a letter of credit issued by soros the soros lc 
in august  wells fargo agreed to release the soros lc  and that it would no longer require an availability reserve although it has the right under the credit facility to establish reserves in the future  as it deems appropriate 
in return  we agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of  availability under the credit facility is determined by a formula that takes into account the amount of our inventory and accounts receivable 
the maximum availability is currently  but can be increased to  at our request  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   total availability under the credit facility was approximately  of which  was committed  leaving approximately  available for further borrowings 
interest accrues monthly on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility during the preceding month at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus or libor plus 
we also pay a monthly commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility ie   less the amount of loans outstanding equal to 
we also pay wells fargo certain fees to open letters of credit and guarantees in an amount equal to a certain specified percentage of the face amount of the letter of credit for each thirty days such letter of credit  or a portion thereof  remains open 
under the terms of the credit facility  soros has the right to purchase all of our obligations from wells fargo at any time if we are then in default under the credit facility

we believe that in order to grow our business  we will need to make additional marketing and advertising commitments in the future 
in addition  we expect to hire and train additional employees for the operations and development of bluefly 
com 
however  our marketing budget and our ability to hire such employees is subject to a number of factors  including our results of operations as well as the amount of additional capital that we raise 
off balance sheet arrangements certain warrants issued in conjunction with certain preferred stock financing transactions are equity linked derivatives and accordingly represent an off balance sheet arrangement 
each of these warrants meet the scope exception in paragraph a of fas and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of fas  but instead included as a component of equity

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company is evaluating the potential effects of adopting sfas  and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
in september the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of this pronouncement will not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires an entity to recognize the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
early application of fin is encouraged 
the company is still evaluating the timing of its adoption of fin and the potential effects of implementing this interpretation on its financial condition and results of operations but does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its results of operations due to the fact that the company has significant historical losses
