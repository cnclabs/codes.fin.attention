we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the estimates and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per member per month pmpm by the number of members covered by our services during the month 
we typically set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in some contracts  the pmpm rates may differ between a customer s lines of business eg  ppo  hmo  medicare advantage 
in addition  some of our services are billed on a fee for service basis 
some of our contracts provide that a portion up to of our fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if our programs do not achieve  when compared to a baseline year  a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs and selected clinical and or other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members 
approximately of revenues recorded during fiscal were performance based and were subject to final reconciliation as of august  we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the level of performance based fees in new contracts  revenue recognition associated with performance based fees  and the timing of data reconciliation  which varies according to contract terms 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for us to receive incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if we exceed contractual performance targets 
we generally bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
deferred revenues can arise from contracts which permit upfront billing and collection of fees covering the entire contractual service period  generally months 
contractually  we cannot bill for any incentive bonus until after contract settlement 
fees for service are typically billed in the month after the services are provided 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of pmpm fees and fees for service as revenue during the period we perform our services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on the most recent assessment of our performance  which represents the amount that the customer would legally be obligated to pay if the contract were terminated as of the latest balance sheet date  and we recognize additional incentive bonuses based on the most recent assessment of our performance  to the extent we consider such amounts collectible 
we assess our level of performance for our contracts based on medical claims and other data that the customer is contractually required to supply 
a minimum of four to six months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual reserves  when appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation 
substantially all of the fees under the mhs pilots in which we are participating are performance based 
the pilots require that  by the end of the third year  we achieve a cumulative net savings total savings for the intervention population as compared to the control group less fees received from cms of 
the cumulative net savings targets are lower at the beginning of the pilots and increase in gradual increments  ending with a cumulative net savings target of at the end of the pilots 
under the amendment to our agreement for our stand alone mhs pilot in maryland and the district of columbia  the refresh population  which we began serving on august   will be a separate cohort served for two years  by the end of which the program is expected to achieve a cumulative net savings when compared to a new control cohort 
although we receive the medical claims and other data associated with the intervention group under these pilots on a monthly basis  we assess our performance against the control group under these pilots based on quarterly summary performance reports received from cms financial reconciliation contractor 
if data is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the measurement period  typically one year  are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the measurement period  previously above targeted levels  subsequently dropped below targeted levels 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile healthcare claims and clinical data 
as of august   performance based fees that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized as revenue in the current and prior years totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million was based on calculations which include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and or the customer s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year  while million was based entirely on actual data received from our customers 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to customer data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  data reconciliation differences  or adjustments to incentive bonuses may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we recognized a net decrease in revenue of million that related to services provided prior to fiscal impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties 
we estimate fair value using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for certain trade names  which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we contract with a third party to assist in developing the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of stock options 
business strategy our primary strategy is to optimize the health of entire populations as well as the quality and affordability of healthcare through our health and care support programs and services both domestically and internationally  thereby creating value for health plans  governments  employers  and hospitals 
we plan to continue using our scalable state of the art care enhancement centers  medical information content  web services  health provider networks and proprietary technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering our health and care support services 
we expect to continue adding services to our product mix that extend our reach and provide support to entire populations 
the flexibility of our programs allows customers to enter the health and care support market at the level of services that they deem appropriate for their organization 
customers may select from a single prevention program or chronic disease to a total population approach  in which all members of the customer s population receive the benefit of our programs 
we deliver programs that engage consumers in their health 
we believe that we can achieve health improvements and generate significant cost savings by addressing consumer and customer needs for effective programs that support the individual across his or her lifetime 
we anticipate that we will incur significant costs during fiscal to enhance and expand our health and care support capabilities  pursue opportunities in international markets  enhance our information technology support  integrate the operations of axia  and open additional or expand current capacity as needed 
we may add some of these new capabilities and technologies through internal development  strategic alliances with other entities and or through selective acquisitions or investments 
results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended august   and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended august  revenues cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income figures may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues for fiscal and fiscal increased and  respectively  over the prior fiscal years 
fiscal revenues increased over fiscal revenues primarily due to the following revenues of million attributable to the acquisition of axia on december   an increase in the number of self insured employer billed lives for care support programs on behalf of our health plan customers from  at august  to  at august   the addition of new care support programs or expansion of existing programs into additional populations with eight existing customers since the beginning of fiscal  and the commencement of ten new care support contracts since the beginning of fiscal these increases were slightly offset by decreases in fiscal revenues compared to fiscal due to the following contract terminations with certain customers  the largest of which we began providing services to again on october   and decreased revenues associated with the mhs pilots 
due primarily to an increasing cumulative net savings target over the term of the pilots  during fiscal cumulative savings fell below the cumulative net savings target  resulting in a reversal of million in performance based revenues 
fiscal revenues increased over fiscal revenues primarily due to the following the addition of new care support programs or expansion of existing programs into additional populations with nine existing customers since the beginning of fiscal  an increase in the number of self insured employer billed lives for care support programs on behalf of our health plan customers from  at august  to  at august   the commencement of nine new contracts since the beginning of fiscal increased membership in customers existing programs  and increased revenues from the mhs pilots of million during fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that fiscal revenues will increase over fiscal revenues primarily due to the expansion of existing contracts  increasing demand for our health and care support services from self insured employers  anticipated new contracts  a full year of revenues associated with axia  and contracts signed during fiscal which have not yet started 
cost of services cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the following a decrease in the level of employee bonus provision due to the company not meeting its internal incentive targets  and a decrease in professional consulting fees related to information technology initiatives 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to the following increased costs related to the mhs pilots  primarily due to additional costs related to the timing of the pilot in georgia in collaboration with cigna  which we began serving during the first quarter of fiscal  enhanced interventions to focus on the special needs of this population  and additional costs related to the refresh population  which we began serving on august   the acquisition of axia  which has somewhat higher cost of services as a percentage of revenues due to the nature of health support services  as well as the related integration costs  and an increase in salary and benefit expense  primarily related to organizational design changes in our field support and operations structure 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily related to the following revenues and costs related to the two mhs pilots  which began in august and september of  respectively 
a significant portion of the performance based fees under these three year pilots has not yet been recognized as revenue as we have not achieved the cumulative net savings targets 
during fiscal  we recorded revenues of million and costs of million attributable to the mhs pilots compared to million of revenues and million of costs during fiscal  and long term incentive compensation costs of million incurred during fiscal  including share based compensation expensed under sfas no 
r and cash based awards issued in lieu of share based awards that were historically granted to certain levels of management  compared to no share based compensation costs during fiscal excluding the revenues and costs associated with the mhs pilots and the long term incentive compensation costs noted above  cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to increased capacity utilization  economies of scale  and productivity enhancements during fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that fiscal cost of services will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of expenses associated with opening additional care enhancement centers and increases in operating staff required for expected increases in demand for our services  increases in indirect staff costs associated with the continuing development and implementation of our health and care support services  increases in information technology and other support staff and costs  an increase in the level of the employee bonus provision  and a full year of cost of services attributable to axia  including related operational integration expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following an increase in salaries and benefits related to changes in our infrastructure to support anticipated future growth  an increase in professional consulting fees related to certain strategic initiatives  and integration costs related to the acquisition of axia 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to the following a decrease in the level of employee bonus provision due to the company not meeting its internal incentive targets  and the acquisition of axia  which had somewhat lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues due to the nature of health support services 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily related to the following costs costs attributable to pursuing opportunities in international markets  which totaled million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and long term incentive compensation costs of million during fiscal  which consisted of share based compensation expensed under sfas no 
r and cash based awards issued in lieu of share based awards that were historically granted to certain levels of management  compared to million of share based compensation costs during fiscal excluding the costs above  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in our operations 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily due to anticipated investments in international initiatives  increases in selling and general administrative costs in support of our existing and anticipated new and expanded contracts  an increase in the level of the employee bonus provision  costs related to relocating our corporate headquarters  a full year of selling  general and administrative costs attributable to axia  and costs related to the integration of axia 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following depreciation and amortization expense associated with the depreciable assets and preliminary identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the axia acquisition on december   and increased depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures to enhance our information technology capabilities  to relocate our phoenix care enhancement center  and expand our calling capacity at existing care enhancement centers 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures to enhance our information technology capabilities and expand our corporate office and calling capacity at existing care enhancement centers 
we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense associated with depreciable assets and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions during fiscal  and additional capital expenditures associated with expected increases in demand for our services and growth and improvement in our information technology capabilities 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to borrowings under the third amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement the third amended credit agreement related to the acquisition of axia on december  interest expense for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily because we had no bank debt outstanding during fiscal we anticipate that interest expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of a full year of interest expense related to borrowings under the third amended credit agreement related to the axia acquisition 
income tax expense our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  somewhat offset by a reduction in our average state income tax rate  which is impacted by our geographic mix of earnings 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily as a result of a reduction in our average state income tax rate  which is impacted by changes in our geographic mix of earnings  and other factors 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will not change significantly from fiscal  however  we continue to evaluate the impact of the axia acquisition on our geographic mix of earnings and overall state tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million during fiscal to million at august  from million at august  the decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of axia  which was funded through the use of approximately million in available cash and million in borrowings 
operating activities for fiscal generated cash of million compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the following an increase in net income  improved cash collections on accounts receivable  and an increase in cash collections recorded to contract billings in excess of earned revenue  primarily related to the mhs pilots 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in operating cash flow primarily related to the following an increase in income tax payments  primarily due to increased payments of taxes that were accrued at the end of the previous fiscal year as well as overpayments on current period taxes  increased payments of employee bonuses that were accrued at the end of the previous fiscal year  and a decrease in days payables outstanding excluding non trade expenses such as salaries and benefits and integration from days at august  to days at august  investing activities during fiscal used million in cash and consisted primarily of payments related to the acquisition of axia on december   purchases of property and equipment  and other investments and acquisitions 
financing activities during fiscal provided million in cash primarily from the proceeds of borrowings under the third amended credit agreement of million  offset by payments of million on these borrowings 
on december   we entered into the third amended credit agreement 
the third amended credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility  including a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit  a million term loan facility  and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million 
as of august   availability under our revolving credit facility totaled million 
revolving advances under the third amended credit agreement generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate  plus a spread of to 
in february  we amended the third amended credit agreement such that term loan borrowings generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate 
the third amended credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
the third amended credit agreement is secured by guarantees from most of the company s domestic subsidiaries and by security interests in substantially all of the company s and such subsidiaries assets 
we are required to repay outstanding revolving loans on the revolving commitment termination date  which is december  we are required to repay term loans in quarterly principal installments aggregating million each  which commenced on march   and the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loans is due and payable at maturity on december  the third amended credit agreement contains various financial covenants  which require us to maintain  as defined  ratios or levels of i total funded debt to ebitda  ii fixed charge coverage  and iii net worth 
the third amended credit agreement also restricts the payment of dividends and limits the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock 
as of august   we were in compliance with all of the covenant requirements of the third amended credit agreement 
on december   we entered into an amortizing fixed interest rate swap agreement for the management of interest rate exposure 
by entering into this interest rate swap agreement  we effectively converted million of floating rate debt to a fixed obligation with an interest rate of 
the principal value of the swap arrangement amortizes over a month period and terminates on march  we currently believe that we meet the hedge accounting criteria under sfas no 
in accounting for the interest rate swap agreement 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  our available cash  and our expected available credit under the third amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund the current level of growth in our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if expanding our operations requires significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional care enhancement centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to expand our operations 
if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise that would expand our operations  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us 
in july  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program which allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions through july  contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations by the indicated period as of august  payments due by year ended august  in s and after total capital lease obligations deferred compensation plan payments long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other contractual cash obligations total contractual cash obligations includes scheduled principal payments  repayment of outstanding revolving loans  and estimated interest payments on outstanding borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
in may  we entered into an office lease agreement for our new corporate headquarters containing approximately  square feet of rentable area 
the term of the lease is years and will commence on the date that the premises are ready for occupancy  which is expected to be by march  other commitments represent cash payments in connection with our strategic alliance agreements and exclude certain variable costs related to one strategic alliance that are based on the number of future eligible members 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin no 
on september  is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
fair value measurement in september the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  including a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions 
it also requires expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides entities with the one time option to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument with a few exceptions  is irrevocable  and must be applied to entire instruments and not to portions of an instrument 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk related to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of the third amended credit agreement  which bears interest based on floating rates 
revolving advances under the third amended credit agreement generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate  plus a spread of to 
in february  we amended the third amended credit agreement such that term loan borrowings generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate 
in order to manage our interest rate exposure under the third amended credit agreement  we entered into an amortizing fixed interest rate swap agreement in december  effectively converting million of floating rate debt to a fixed obligation with an interest rate of a one point interest rate change would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for fiscal as of august   as a result of our investment in international initiatives  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
because a significant portion of these risks is economically hedged with currency options and forwards contracts and because our international initiatives are not yet material to our consolidated results of operations  a change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position for fiscal we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
