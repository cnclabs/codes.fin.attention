our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  were in our us segment and were in our international segment as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who sell to our higher revenue customers  teams of telesales people who sell to our lower revenue customers and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
we deliver our solutions primarily through the web and other electronic methods  including desktop and enterprise application software  as well as through third party resellers and enterprise software vendors 
our customers we believe that different size customers have different needs and require different skill sets to service them 
accordingly  we have adopted a go to market sales strategy that focuses on distinct groups categorized internally as large customers  middle market customers and small market customers 
our large customers are those having spend with us of million or more  while our middle market customers are those having spend with us of between  and million and our small market customers are those having spend with us of  or less 
our principal customers within these groups are banks and other credit and financial institutions  manufacturers  wholesalers  insurance companies and telecommunication companies  as well as sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue or of the revenue of our us or international business segments 
accordingly  neither we nor either of our business segments is dependent on a single customer or a few customers  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of either of our business segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in the us  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of market share and revenue  including revenue from sales of third party business credit information 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes in order to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 

table of contents we also compete in the us with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our direct competitors include companies such as experian and infousa  inc infousa 
in our supply management solutions business  we directly compete with consulting firms  specialty data providers and specialty software companies 
in our e business solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s pro  hoover s pro plus and hoover s pro premium products compete with other business information providers such as infousa 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s lite solution mainly competes with advertising supported websites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and cbs marketwatch 
outside the us  the competitive environment varies by country  and in some countries we are a market leader 
for example  in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as cerved in italy and experian in the united kingdom 
in addition  common links exist among some of these competitors through their membership in european information network alliances  such as bignet experian and we believe that competitors may be pursuing the establishment of their own pan european network through direct investment  which could ultimately be positioned by them as an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our trusted brand  our financial flexibility  our winning culture and our dunsright quality process form a powerful competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications therefore 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that each of the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  
table of contents service marks  databases  software  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in item of this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of strategic importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process  through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our us segment and corporate and approximately  were in our international segment 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in our us segment 
workers councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in the european and latin american operations of our international segment

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we partner with single source providers in certain countries that support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on our strategic partners in our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  we have outsourced various functions  such as our technology help desk and network management functions in the us and the uk  and we have also outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery  customer service and some financial processes  such as cash collections 
if one or more data providers were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  substantially increase the cost of their data  or not adhere to our data quality standards  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenue  operating income and earnings per share 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including our strategic partners  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  materially impacting our business and financial results 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large web search engine companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services 
weak economic conditions also can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are facing increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
in addition  consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they play  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 

table of contents our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth  deliver reliable and high quality business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  adopt and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure to support product delivery as customer needs and preferences change and competitors offer more sophisticated products  attract and retain a high performance workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management of strategic partner relationships in our international segment that are part of our d b worldwide network 
we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals or a shift in product mix that results in a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
as contracts are renewed  we have  and may continue to experience  a shift in product mix underlying such contracts 
this could result in the deferral of increased amounts of revenue into future periods as a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of our contracts rather than upfront at contract signing 
although this may cause our financial results from period to period to vary substantially  such change in revenue recognition will not change the total revenue recognized over the life of our contracts 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data and may impact our financial results 
certain types of information we gather  compile and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain markets in which we operate  particularly in our international markets 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new laws and regulations 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  could affect our operations 
this could result in legislative or regulatory limitations being imposed on our operations  increased compliance or litigation expense and or loss of revenue 

table of contents in addition  governmental agencies may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers or provide alternative services  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
in addition  any such price increases or alternative services may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share 
for example  in october  the italian government issued a decree that  among other things  increased the cost of certain data that supports our italian real estate monitoring service 
in response to this increase we temporarily suspended this service and have since launched alternate solutions that are not dependent on this data 
in addition  we have commenced legal and other challenges to this price increase 
we cannot predict the outcome of our challenges or the market response to replacement solutions that we may offer from time to time 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public which is based upon our assumptions regarding our financial performance 
this includes  for example  assumptions regarding our ability to grow revenue and to provide profitable operating income 
we believe that our financial guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of our view of our near term financial performance 
such financial guidance may not always be accurate  however  due to our inability to meet the assumptions we make and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors and in our public filings with the sec 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance downward as we conduct our operations throughout the year  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to achieve our financial aspirations  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have established financial aspirations for the through timeframe with respect to the financial performance that we believe would be achieved based upon our planned business strategy for the next several years 
these financial aspirations can only be achieved if the assumptions underlying our business strategy are fully realized some of which we cannot control eg market growth rates  macroeconomic conditions and customer preferences 
as part of our annual planning process we will review these assumptions and we intend to provide our financial guidance to shareholders on an annual basis 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our solutions  which could adversely impact our revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use and purchase business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing solutions beyond data  such as enhanced analytics and assisting with their data integration efforts 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to simplify our solutions and pricing offerings and enhance our marketing efforts to these customers 
to address customer needs for pricing certainty and increased access to our solutions  we provide subscription pricing plans through our preferred pricing agreement and our preferred pricing agreement with dnbi 
these subscription pricing plans provide expanded access to our risk management solutions in a way that provides more certainty over related costs to the customer  which in turn  generally results in customers increasing their spend on our solutions 
these plans have been an important driver of our growth in and 
table of contents our success moving forward is dependent  in part  on the continued penetration of these offerings and the successful rollout of similar programs in various markets around the world 
similarly  our continued success is dependent on customers acceptance of our dnbi offering 
our operations in the international segment are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could adversely impact our operating results 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
for the three years ended december   and  our international segment accounted for  and of total revenue 
our international business is subject to many challenges  the most significant being our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customer s need to purchase our data 
our international strategy includes forming strategic partner relationships in certain markets with third parties to improve our data quality 
we form and manage these strategic partner alliances to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic partnerships may not be successful or may be subject to ownership change 
in september  we formed a strategic relationship covering australia and new zealand d b australasia 
this strategic relationship contributed less than one percent of our total revenue in and contributed less than million of the more than million business records contained in our global commercial database 
the shareholders of d b australasia are considering a sale of their controlling interest in the company d b has a small minority interest as a shareholder 
we believe that we have appropriate contractual protections to prevent the shares of d b australasia from being acquired by any of our global competitors  however  there can be no assurance that a potential buyer of such shares won t seek to contest the enforceability of these protections 
as such we will take the necessary actions to ensure we protect our brand and ensure an ongoing supply of dunsright quality data for our global customers 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business or the business of our partners on whom we depend 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors may include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions  competition from government agencies in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic partnership alliances  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 

table of contents a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the business partners to whom we grant non exclusive licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  resulting in decreased revenue  operating income and earnings per share 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under note contingencies legal proceedings in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  certain of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would negatively impact our financial results 
successful execution of our strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to continually adapt and improve our organizational design and efficiency to meet the changing needs of our business and our customers  our ability to implement all of the actions required under this program within the established time frame  our ability to implement actions that require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  
table of contents entering into or amending agreements with third party vendors to renegotiate terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources 
if we fail to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth from new initiatives  the market value of our common stock may suffer 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels and to appropriately utilize the time and resources of such personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are subject to the following risks acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  and we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any acquisition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue  which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
divested business revenue included in our financial results is as follows the nordic region sweden  denmark  norway and finland  all sold in the first quarter of  india and other distribution channels in pakistan and the middle east sold in the first quarter of  central europe germany  austria  switzerland  poland  hungary and the czech republic  all sold in the second quarter of  iberia spain and portugal  both sold in the fourth quarter of  and france sold in the fourth quarter of 
these divested businesses have been classified as divestitures in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the measure of core revenue provides valuable insight into our revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results 
during the years ended december  and  there were no divestitures 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
we further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
in addition  for the years ended december  and  we analyze core revenue both before and after the results of our italian real estate data business because of the 
table of contents distortion of comparability of results due to significant price increases in response to legislative changes and the uncertainty of other regulatory changes 
management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality  efficiency and cost  in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
it should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
we also use free cash flow to manage our business 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for  or superior to  net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a 
table of contents substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations  below  for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis

table of contents our flexible business model and restructuring since the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  we have implemented financial flexibility programs 
financial flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
with each program we have incurred restructuring charges which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations  less assumed sublease income and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
on january   we announced our financial flexibility program 
our financial flexibility program is designed to significantly reduce the complexity of our business 
this program will create financial flexibility through several initiatives  including the following organizational design this initiative is intended to improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by addressing spans of control  organizational layers and the effectiveness of leadership processes  product and technology complexity this initiative is intended to simplify our product and technology environment by reducing product complexity and proliferation as well as eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure  sales force effectiveness this initiative is intended to improve our sales force tools  reduce the non selling time of our sales force and enhance our new customer acquisition activities  and other efficiency measures this initiative is intended to improve the operating efficiencies of our facilities  reduce our purchasing costs and simplify our data collection and product delivery 
we expect to complete all actions under the program by december on an annualized basis  these actions are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives 
to implement these initiatives  we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million to million 
in addition  we expect to incur restructuring charges  totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million relates to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
as a result of this reengineering program  we expect that approximately positions will be eliminated globally 
our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 

table of contents we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we offer substantially all of our us based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan 
the us qualified plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of spin off companies 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligations  respectively  at december  our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees  who retire with years of vesting service after age  are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  amended by sfas no 
 and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by outside actuaries 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 
this assumption was  and in  and  respectively 
the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real 
table of contents estate investments 
every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
based on the factors noted above  the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually 
for our us plans and postretirement benefit plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost and postretirement cost by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   for all of our us pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan  we increased the discount rate to and from and used at december   respectively 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the lower amortization of actuarial loss in of million and million related to the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans  respectively  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under sfas no 
at january   primarily resulting from a higher discount rate and better plan asset performance 
the higher amortization of actuarial loss of million in related to our non us plans is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses as a result of adopting new mortality tables and a lower discount rate at january  differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic cost for our pension plans of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net periodic pension income of million for a major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded investment gains of million  million and million  respectively  in our pension plans  of which million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan and million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the us plans was  million and million  respectively  compared with the fair value of its plan assets of  million and million  respectively 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity 
we adopted sfas no 
as of december  and we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset  on a plan by plan basis  with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  or aoci  in shareholders equity  net of tax 
accordingly  the amounts 
table of contents recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs 
we recognized charges of million  net of applicable deferred taxes  to our shareholders equity in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs included in the shareholders equity would be amortized out of equity based on an actuarial calculation each period 
gains and losses and prior service costs that arise during the year will be recognized as a component of aoci 
a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our benefit plans by changing the amount of the benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
for the us non qualified plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our projected benefit obligation by approximately million

sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate future forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reductions in expense as they occur 
as a result  we have adjusted for this cumulative effect and recognized a pre tax reduction in stock based compensation of million related to our restricted stock and restricted stock unit programs during the first quarter of as required under the modified prospective method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs and employee stock purchase plan espp prior to january  the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model

if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our share based compensation expense  operating income  net income and earnings per share 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase was primarily due to the following costs associated with revenue generating investments in connection with our strategy  such as acxiom which will significantly increase the speed  data processing capacity and matching capabilities we provide our us sales and marketing customers  and our dunsright quality process and investments in dnbi  our interactive  web based subscription service  higher pension costs and lower postretirement benefit income see section titled pension and postretirement for further discussion  increased costs associated with the acquisition of open ratings in the first quarter of  and the effect of the adoption of sfas no

selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the decrease was primarily due to the following reduced costs associated with the sale of our divested businesses  and administrative cost savings  such as lower compensation costs achieved through our financial flexibility programs and lower spending for sarbanes oxley related expenses  partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange 
matters impacting both operating expenses and selling and administrative expenses pension and postretirement we had a net pension cost of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net pension income of million for the year ended december   for our pension plans globally 
the increase in pension cost or decrease in pension income from through was primarily due to increased actuarial loss amortizations included in annual expense as required by sfas no 
actuarial loss amortizations included in annual pension expense for all global plans were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to our us plans 
the losses subject to amortization are primarily the result of asset losses from through  and the impact of lower discount rates 
additionally  a decrease in the long term rate of return assumption for our us qualified plan also contributed to the increase in expense during the period 
the long term rate of return assumption was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our us plans for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
we expect that the net pension cost in will be approximately million for all of our global pension plans 
the decrease in pension cost from to is primarily driven by a thirty four basis points increase in the discount rate applied to our us plans at january  and lower actuarial loss amortization included in we had postretirement benefit income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lower postretirement benefit income for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   was primarily due to lower negative prior service cost amortizations recognized in postretirement benefit income because of accelerated recognition 
table of contents of prior service cost as a one time curtailment gain in associated with the and financial flexibility programs 
the curtailment gain is included within restructuring charges 
the increase in postretirement benefit income from the year ended december  to the year ended december   was primarily due to the savings from the medicare reform act which was implemented in the third quarter of versus a full year impact in  as well as an actuarial gain from the plan valuation 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million in we consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs  and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no

we have selected the modified prospective method and  therefore  prior periods have not been restated

and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option programs 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized for grants under the stock option programs or the espp 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   our total compensation expense was comprised of million of stock option expense  million of stock appreciation rights expense  million of espp expense and million net of million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions of restricted stock  restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity expense 
the restricted stock  restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity expense for the year ended december  was million net of million related to the accumulated effect of forfeiture assumptions as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to higher expense reversal as a result of higher forfeitures activity related to unvested shares  as well as lower restricted stock opportunities awarded to employees in versus in addition  the lower expense was further reduced by the forfeiture assumption required by sfas no 
r  including a cumulative effective adjustment to reflect adjustments to previously recognized compensation expense for awards outstanding at the adoption date of sfas no 
r that we do not expect to vest 
we consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  this decrease was primarily driven by the reduced capital requirements in our business in prior years  which has more recently been partially offset by increased costs in revenue generating investments as well as capital costs for newly leased facilities 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  this decrease was primarily driven by changes in our business model in prior years  which enabled us to reduce the capital requirements of our business through our continuous process of reengineering  leveraging strategic partners in key markets and outsourcing capital intensive activities

the primary drivers of this growth were new customer acquisitions and higher purchases from our existing customers  partially offset by a decline in revenue as a result of an expiration in april of a five year arrangement entered into in connection with the five year licensing arrangement referenced above  and a shift in product mix to some of our newer value added products where a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of the contract versus up front  at signing 
we believe that we will continue to experience a greater percentage of sales on new solutions where revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters

therefore  our discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  references only our core revenue results 
international core revenue increased million  or both before and after the effect of foreign exchange  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of increased revenue in our uk market  due in part to poor operating performance in the first half of and higher product usage in from a key global customer  increased revenue in our asia pacific markets due to a shift in the timing of a customer renewal from the fourth quarter of into the first quarter of and higher license fee revenue  increased revenue from our international partners attributable to royalty payments  fulfillment services on behalf of our partnerships and product usage  and increased revenue from our e business solutions primarily attributable to increased market penetration of our hoover s solution  partially offset by a decline in our traditional risk management solutions  primarily related to our italian real estate data business see below for further discussion

we experienced increased revenue in our uk market due in part to poor operating performance in the first half of and higher product usage in from a key global customer 
also  we recognized increased revenue from our international partnerships and increased license fee revenue from our asia pacific markets 
this increase was partially offset by a general decline in product usage primarily in our italian real estate data business 
this decline in product usage resulted from certain tax legislation in italy impacting a subset of our customers eg  tax collectors and our monitoring service business 
value added risk management solutions  which accounted for of international risk management solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange driven mainly by higher value project oriented business in certain of our international markets  partially offset by a loss in customers in our italian market which resulted in lower renewals and lower project oriented business 
sales marketing solutions an increase in sales marketing solutions of million  or both before and after the effect of foreign exchange  reflecting traditional sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of international sales marketing solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange  reflecting a lower rate of cancellations in the first quarter of as compared to the prior year period and increased purchases from certain global customers in our asia pacific markets 
value added sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of international sales marketing solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange due primarily to royalty revenue from our international partnerships  a shift in the timing of a customer renewal from the fourth quarter of into the first quarter of and an increase in purchases by customers in our asia pacific markets 
this increase was partially offset by lower project oriented business 
e business solutions an increase in e business solutions of million  or before the effect of foreign exchange

table of contents operating income international operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily due to an increase in core revenue  a million accrual reversal in our italian real estate data business  which we recognized in the fourth quarter of the accrual reversal was the result of the successes in challenging the validity of certain tax increases and related legislative developments impacting the cost of our data acquisition from the italian government 
increased data sales to our us segment  increased costs in related to the investigation and final resolution of the dispute on the sale of our french business with no comparable costs in and generally lower legal costs in  and savings from our continuous process of reengineering  partially offset by increased selling expenses related to increased revenue  and the impact of increased costs associated with data purchases from our international partners 
certain additional factors affecting our international segment create particular challenges for our international business 
for example  our results have been  and may continue to be  significantly impacted by legislative changes affecting the fees charged by the italian government to acquire and or re use data  as well as the possibility that government agencies may seek to enter the market and compete with our services 
specifically  the reported results herein reflect significant price increases to customers of our italian real estate data business that we implemented during the second quarter of these price increases were implemented to offset new regulations that significantly increased data acquisition costs for our italian real estate data business and required that we paid a fee each time we resold that data 
we challenged such regulations in court and with anti trust authorities  sustaining significant legal and management costs  withheld certain payments to the government and established the appropriate reserves 
in the fourth quarter of  we released a portion of the reserves as a result of successes in challenging the validity of certain tax increases and related legislative developments 
we continue to actively monitor the status of this and other legislative developments 
we also intend to pursue favorable resolution of this matter 
consistent with our financial flexibility model to the extent we are successful and are able to pursue all or a portion of the remaining million accrual  we will look for opportunities to reinvest these amounts in the business to fund our growth strategy

this growth was attributable primarily to our italian real estate data business  which contributed eight percentage points of such growth  mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in ribes spa  and an increase in revenue in our other international markets  primarily resulting from increased product usage by existing customers  partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the uk resulting primarily from the continued impact of lower customer product usage due to our insufficient focus on customer renewals in late and the first quarter of in the second half of  we introduced a subscription plan in our european markets  leveraging our success in rolling out a similar program in the us this new plan provides our customers unlimited use  within pre defined ranges  of our risk management reports and data  provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels 
we believe that the subscription plan will be an important contribution to our revenue growth in future years

market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  from time to time  we use interest rate instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to manage our exposure  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
on september  and february   we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the objective of these hedges was to 
table of contents mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in anticipation of the debt issuance discussed below 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated  resulting in proceeds of approximately million at the date of termination 
the proceeds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are being amortized over the life of the notes 
in connection with the million  five year  fixed rate senior note maturing march  we entered into fixed to floating libor rate indexed interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with a notional principal amount totaling million  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term  fixed rate notes 
the arrangement was considered a highly effective hedge  and therefore the accounting for these hedges had no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that mature on march  the notes  bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of  payable semi annually 
the proceeds were used to repay our then outstanding million notes which matured on march  the swap agreements expired in march contemporaneous with the note repayment 
at december  and  we had a million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates  which expires in september at december  we had million of floating rate debt outstanding under this facility 
at december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding under this facility 
foreign exchange risk we have numerous offices in countries outside the us and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players 
our international operations generated approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets as of december  and  respectively  were located outside the us  and no country outside the us  other than the uk  had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and investments 
we use short term  foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollar 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions and international earnings hedges are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with net investment hedges  if any  are recorded as cumulative translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  from time to time  we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
as of december   there were million in option contracts outstanding 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are mark to market at the end of each quarter  and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents at december  and  we had a notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively  of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated intercompany loans 
gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  in addition  at december   we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding associated with our international investments 
losses associated with these contracts were million at december  these contracts typically have various expiration dates within three months of entry into such contracts 
if exchange rates on average were to increase from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized gain would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in connection with our commitment to delivering total shareholder return tsr  we will remain highly disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash  maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash first  making ongoing investments in the business to drive organic growth  second  continuing to look at value accretive acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth  and third  continuing to return cash to shareholders 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements  is sufficient to meet our short term needs  including the cash cost of restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  excluding the legal matters identified therein for which exposures cannot be estimated 
in addition  we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued commitment to tsr 
for example  in march  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that mature on march   bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of  payable semi annually 
these proceeds were used to repay our existing million notes that matured on march  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and share repurchases  when needed 
such borrowings would be supported by our bank revolving credit facility  when needed

most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities  which are under operating leases that expire over the next years  with the majority expiring within five years 
we also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years 
these computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as the lease terms expire and as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance 
in july  we outsourced certain technology functions to computer sciences corporation csc under a year agreement  which we may terminate for a fee at any time and under certain conditions 
under the terms of the agreement  csc is responsible for the data center operations  technology help desk  network management functions and for certain application development and maintenance in the us and uk

represents projected contributions to our non us defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans  including the us non qualified plans and our postretirement benefit plan 
we do not expect to make any contributions to our us qualified plan 
the expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service 
a closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments  assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately years 
as part of our spin off from moody s d b in  moody s and d b entered into the taa dated as of september  under the taa  moody s d b and d b agreed that moody s d b would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with the exercise of moody s d b stock options including moody s d b options exercised by d b employees and d b would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of d b stock options including d b options exercised by employees of moody s d b 
put simply  the tax deduction would go to the company that granted the stock options  rather than to the employer of the individual who exercised the options 
the taa provides  however  that if the irs issues rules  regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the compensation expense deductions under the taa  then the party that becomes entitled under such guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the tax benefit it has realized  in order to indemnify the other party for its loss of such deduction 
the irs issued rulings discussing an employer s entitlement to stock option deductions after a spin off or liquidation that appear to require that the compensation expense deduction belongs to the employer of the option grantee and not to the issuer of the option ie  d b would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with a d b employee exercising a moody s d b option 
during the year ended december   we made a payment of approximately million to moody s d b under the taa that was fully accrued as of december  in addition  under the taa  we received the benefit of additional tax deductions and under the taa we may be required to reimburse moody s d b for the loss of income tax deductions relating to to of approximately million in the aggregate for such years 
this potential reimbursement is a reduction to shareholders equity 
we may also be required to pay additional amounts in the future based upon interpretations by the parties of the taa  timing of future exercises of options  the future price of stock underlying the stock options and relevant tax rates 
as of december   current and former employees of d b held million moody stock options 
these stock options had a weighted average exercise price of and a remaining  weighted average contractual life of two years as of december  all of these options are currently exercisable 
capital structure every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans 
during  in connection with our commitment to tsr  we anticipate continued share repurchases and have initiated a quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on march   to shareholders of record on the close of business on march   as declared by our board of directors on january  
table of contents we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements  is sufficient to meet our short term needs  including the cash cost of restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies  excluding the legal matters identified herein for which exposures cannot be estimated 
as we execute our long term tsr strategy  which contemplates strategic acquisitions  we may require or consider additional financing to fund our tsr strategy

this initial cash dividend is payable on march   to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  potential payments in tax and legal matters we and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are at various stages of resolution  but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in item legal proceedings 
we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters 
financial flexibility program on january   we announced our financial flexibility program 
our financial flexibility program is designed to significantly reduce the complexity of our business 
this program will create financial flexibility through several initiatives  including the following organizational design this initiative is intended to improve the efficiency of how we are organized and how we operate as a business by addressing spans of control  organizational layers and the effectiveness of leadership processes  product and technology complexity this initiative is intended to simplify our product and technology environment by reducing product complexity and proliferation as well as eliminating and consolidating systems and technology infrastructure  sales force effectiveness this initiative is intended to improve our sales force tools  reduce the non selling time of our sales force and enhance our new customer acquisition activities  and other efficiency measures this initiative is intended to improve the operating efficiencies of our facilities  reduce our purchasing costs and simplify our data collection and product delivery 

table of contents we expect to complete all actions under the program by december on an annualized basis  these actions are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives

in addition  we expect to incur restructuring charges  totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million relates to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
as a result of this reengineering program  we expect that approximately positions will be eliminated globally

the decrease in funded status of the non us plans was primarily due to a higher projected benefit obligation at december   driven by a lower discount rate  the application of updated mortality tables and other assumptions  partially offset by the gains in plan asset performance

for funding purposes  as governed by the internal revenue service regulations  we are not required to contribute to the us qualified plan  the largest of our six plans  in as the plan was considered fully funded under the provisions of the internal revenue code for the plan year 
in august  the pension protection act of ppa was signed into law 
one of the principal changes under this legislation relates to the way assets and liabilities are valued to determine required pension contributions 
the majority of the changes are effective in at the current date  there are still factors that need to be clarified or defined in the guidance by the regulatory bodies to fully analyze the impact of ppa on our plans 
based on the current understanding of the legislative changes  if the us qualified plan asset returns are flat and the assets decline by the amount of benefits paid to plan participants  and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same  we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until if plan assets appreciate between now and  the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond if plan assets depreciate between now and  we could be required to make contributions sooner than we expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans during the year ended december  the expected contribution is approximately million  compared to million in in addition  we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  see the contractual obligations table above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions we do not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k
