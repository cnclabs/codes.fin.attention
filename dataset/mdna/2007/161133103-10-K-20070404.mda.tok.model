factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ from those described in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following  which are discussed in more detail in item a 
risk factors  above our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences  and other fashion related factors  which we may not be able to successfully accomplish in the future 
a slowdown in the united states economy  an uncertain economic outlook  and escalating energy costs could lead to reduced consumer demand for our products in the future 
the women s specialty retail apparel and direct to consumer markets are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of crosstown traders  inc crosstown traders with the operations of charming shoppes  inc in addition  we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for crosstown traders  including the successful launch of our lane bryant catalog 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plans for entry into the outlet store distribution channel and expansion of our cacique product line through new store formats 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for increased profitability and growth in our retail stores or direct to consumer segments 
our business plan is largely dependent upon continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market  which may not occur 

table of contents we depend on key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  dorrit j 
bern  and we may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
we depend on our distribution and fulfillment centers and third party freight consolidators and service providers  and could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores and shipping our products to our e commerce and catalog customers if operations at any of these locations were to be disrupted for any reason 
we depend on the availability of credit for our working capital needs  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  and on our credit card securitization facilities 
if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing at an affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our stores  e commerce  or catalog businesses would be adversely affected 
natural disasters  as well as war  acts of terrorism  or other armed conflict  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and customer traffic to our stores  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
such risks include but are not necessarily limited to political instability  imposition of  or changes in  duties or quotas  trade restrictions  increased security requirements applicable to imports  delays in shipping  increased costs of transportation  and issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
our retail stores and direct to consumer segments experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
any decrease in sales or margins during our peak sales periods  or in the availability of working capital during the months preceding such periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather conditions may have a negative impact on our sales 
we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for our operations at a reasonable cost 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights  which are important to our success and our competitive position 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of suitable sales associates at our stores 
in addition  we are subject to the fair labor standards act and various state and federal laws and regulations governing such matters as minimum wages  exempt status classification  overtime  and employee benefits 
changes in federal or state laws or regulations regarding minimum wages or other employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefit costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver merchandise to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards 
our retail stores segment sales are dependent upon a high volume of traffic in the strip centers and malls in which our stores are located  and our future retail store growth is dependent upon the availability of suitable locations for new stores 
inadequate systems capacity  a disruption or slowdown in telecommunications services  changes in technology  changes in government regulations  systems issues  security breaches  a failure to integrate order management systems  or customer privacy issues could result in reduced sales or increases in operating expenses as a result of our efforts or our inability to remedy such issues 

table of contents successful operation of our e commerce websites and our catalog business is dependent on our ability to maintain efficient and uninterrupted customer service and fulfillment operations 
we may be unable to manage significant increases in certain costs vital to catalog operations  including postage  paper  and acquisition of prospects  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
response rates to our catalogs and access to new customers could decline  which would adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
we may be unable to successfully implement our plan to improve merchandise assortments in our retail stores or direct to consumer segments 
we make certain significant assumptions  estimates  and projections related to the useful lives of our property  plant  and equipment and the valuation of intangible assets related to acquisitions 
the carrying amount and or useful life of these assets are subject to periodic valuation tests for impairment 
impairment results when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted or for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the discounted future cash flows associated with the asset 
if actual experience were to differ materially from the assumptions  estimates  and projections used to determine useful lives or the valuation of property  plant  equipment  or intangible assets  a write down for impairment of the carrying value of the assets  or acceleration of depreciation or amortization of the assets  could result 
such a write down or acceleration of depreciation or amortization would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
changes to existing accounting rules or the adoption of new rules could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
our independent registered public accounting firm is also currently required to attest to whether or not our assessment is fairly stated in all material respects and to separately report on whether or not they believe that we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to timely attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a possible loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
such a failure could result in our inability to provide timely and or reliable financial information and could adversely affect our business 
overview in fiscal  our diluted earnings per share increased by to and our consolidated net sales increased by to billion from billion in fiscal the increase in consolidated net sales was driven by i the inclusion of the sales of crosstown traders  inc crosstown traders  which we acquired on june   for the entire fiscal period  ii sales from new lane bryant  lane bryant outlet  and petite sophisticate outlet stores opened during fiscal  iii an increase in comparable store sales at our lane bryant and catherines brands  iv increases in store related e commerce sales at all of our retail store brands  and v an additional week of operations in fiscal with the acquisition of crosstown traders  we operate in two segments retail stores and direct to consumer 
our retail stores segment operates through our lane bryant including lane bryant outlet  fashion bug  catherines plus sizes  and petite sophisticate outlet stores and store related e commerce 
our direct to consumer segment includes catalog and catalog related e commerce 

table of contents in our retail stores segment  net sales increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal sales from new stores including outlet store sales  an increase in comparable store sales  increased e commerce sales at all brands  and an additional week of operations in fiscal contributed to the increase in consolidated retail stores segment net sales 
comparable store sales are based on equivalent week and week periods and are not affected by the additional week of operations in fiscal for fiscal  lane bryant achieved a increase in comparable store sales as compared to a increase in fiscal for the fiscal fourth quarter  lane bryant experienced a decrease in comparable store sales  as compared to an increase of in the fiscal fourth quarter 
compared to a strong performance in the fiscal fourth quarter  lane bryant experienced decreases in both average dollar sale per transaction and traffic levels in the fiscal fourth quarter 
in addition  lane bryant experienced a sharp downtrend in sales of premium denim products in response to changing fashion trends in the fiscal fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in comparable store sales was offset by new store sales including outlet store sales  as well as an increase in e commerce sales 
our catherines stores achieved a comparable store sales increase in fiscal as compared to a increase in fiscal for the fiscal fourth quarter  catherines achieved a increase in comparable store sales  as compared to an increase of for the fiscal fourth quarter 
catherines strong performance during fiscal continued into fiscal  with significant increases in traffic  the number of transactions per store  and e commerce sales as compared to the prior year period 
at fashion bug  comparable store sales decreased in fiscal  as compared to flat comparable store sales in fiscal fashion bug experienced a decrease in comparable store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  as compared to a increase in the fiscal fourth quarter 
sales from the additional week of operations in fiscal and an increase in e commerce sales were partially offset by the decrease in comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of open stores 
store related e commerce sales for our three brands increased from approximately of total sales in fiscal to approximately of total sales in fiscal demand in the e commerce channel continues to outpace the growth in our retail stores 
we have dedicated  and will continue to dedicate  more of our resources to meet the growth in this channel 
for fiscal  we expect our store related e commerce sales to increase to more than percent of consolidated net sales  and we see opportunities to continue to expand our product offerings into additional categories  such as hard to find sizes 
this will allow us to offer a greater variety of merchandise categories than those currently offered in our stores 
total net sales for the direct to consumer segment were million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal from the date of acquisition of crosstown traders on june  the direct to consumer segment performed below our sales plan for fiscal as a result of reduced response rates from our core customers to our apparel catalog offerings 
the disruption caused by the consolidation of our catalog merchandise operations into tucson  arizona during fiscal had a greater than anticipated negative impact on crosstown s apparel catalog operations 
as a result  we reduced our catalog prospecting and circulation levels in order to reduce advertising expenditures during the period 
we expect to maintain or slightly increase our prospecting and circulation levels in fiscal 
table of contents for the fourth quarter of fiscal  total net sales for the direct to consumer segment were million  as compared to total net sales of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal a significant amount of fourth quarter sales were derived from our figi s catalog  which markets food and specialty gift products and does a substantial portion of its business during the december holiday season 
sales from the figi s catalog for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our sales plan  while sales from our apparel catalogs were below plan for the reasons discussed above 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and is continuously faced with new and existing competitors seeking areas of growth to expand their businesses 
our strategy focuses on increasing our market share in the growing plus size women s apparel market through our retail stores and direct to consumer segments 
americans continue to gain weight in all age groups  with an estimate of more than of american adults being overweight source american obesity association obesity in the us fact sheet and half of american women wearing size or larger source npd group 
we offer plus size women s apparel through multiple channels to a broad range of age groups  with varied fashion tastes and income levels 
by continuing to focus on the plus size market  we believe that we are well positioned to meet the demands of this growing demographic 
in addition to allowing us to expand our multi channel strategy for our retail store brands  the acquisition of crosstown traders provides us with the expertise and infrastructure necessary to service the lane bryant catalog business when the lane bryant catalog trademark reverts back to us in late fiscal we view the growth in our store base and direct to consumer channels as an opportunity for us to maintain and increase our market share 
we continue to pursue ways to increase our relevance to our customer  and believe that  through offering multiple shopping channels for our customers and other factors such as our expertise in plus size fit and our figure magazine a leading plus size fashion and lifestyle magazine  we continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
we plan to continue the expansion of our market position in the women s plus size specialty apparel market 
these plans include several strategic initiatives  which are described below continued expansion of our side by side lane bryant intimate apparel store concept  which we successfully tested during fiscal and implemented in fiscal this concept pairs lane bryant s casual and wear to work sportswear assortments with an expanded line of cacique intimates  as well as additional national brands  presented in a double store front 
during fiscal  we operated stores in the side by side format  including stores that were relocated or remodeled 
during fiscal  we plan to open approximately new lane bryant stores  including stores in the new side by side format 
in fiscal  we entered the outlet store channel through the assumption of outlet store leases from retail brand alliance and the opening of lane bryant outlet stores and petite sophisticate outlet stores  many of which are operating as side by side stores with lane bryant outlet stores 
this channel  which we expected would incur an operating loss during fiscal  performed above plan  was profitable during the fourth quarter  and broke even for fiscal during fiscal  we plan to open approximately new lane bryant outlet stores including conversions from lane bryant stores  new petite sophisticate outlet stores  and new full line petite sophisticate stores 
in our direct to consumer segment  we will focus on building infrastructure to prepare for the launch of the lane bryant catalog  as well as improving the performance of our core apparel group catalogs 
the lane bryant catalog trademark  currently licensed by a third party  will revert to us in late fiscal 
table of contents in addition  we are planning for continued growth in e commerce and cross channel selling tools  and exploring opportunities for international expansion 
critical accounting policies we have prepared the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we periodically reevaluate our accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies and related assumptions to be more critical to  and involve the most significant management judgments and estimates in  the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec codification of staff accounting bulletins topic  revenue recognition 
our revenues from merchandise sales are net of sales discounts  returns  and allowances and exclude sales tax 
we record a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns and we defer recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the level of revenue recognized 
catalog and e commerce revenues include shipping and handling fees billed to customers 
these revenues are recognized after the following have occurred execution of the customer s order  authorization of the customer s credit card has been received  and the product has been shipped to and received by the customer 
we record a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns  and defer recognition of revenue for product shipped but not yet received by the customer based on an estimate of the number of days the shipments are in transit 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and or the time it takes for customers to receive our products would affect the level of revenue recognized 
we offer our customers various loyalty card programs 
customers that join these programs are entitled to various benefits  including discounts and rebates on purchases during the membership period 
customers generally join these programs by paying an annual membership fee 
we recognize revenue from these loyalty programs as a component of net sales over the life of the membership period based on when the customer earns the benefits and when the fee is no longer refundable 
costs we incur in connection with administering these programs are recognized in cost of goods sold as incurred 
we sell gift cards to our retail stores segment customers through our stores  store related websites  and through a third party 
we recognize revenue from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer 
our gift cards do not currently contain expiration dates or inactivity fees 
we recognize gift card breakage unused gift card balances for which we believe the likelihood of redemption is remote as net sales based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns 
a change in the historical pattern of gift card redemptions would affect the level of revenue recognized 

table of contents accounts receivable our figi s catalog offers credit to its customers using interest free  three payment credit terms over three months  with the first payment due on a defined date to days after a stated holiday 
a substantial portion of the figi s catalog business is conducted during the december holiday season 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience  past history of recoveries  and expectations of future performance 
significant changes in our historical write off or recovery experience could have a material impact on the levels of our accounts receivable valuation reserves 
inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market  using the retail inventory method average cost basis  for our retail stores and direct to consumer segment inventories 
under the retail inventory method  we adjust the valuation of inventories at cost  and the resulting gross margins  in proportion to markdowns and shrinkage on our retail inventories 
our use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
our estimation of markdowns involves certain management judgments and estimates which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
our failure to properly estimate markdowns currently could result in an overstatement or understatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
at the end of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  in addition to markdowns that had been recorded in inventory  an additional million  million  and million  respectively  of markdowns  representing markdowns not yet taken on aged inventory  were recorded in order to properly reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
see accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor below  as of february   january   and january   million  million  and million  respectively  of cash received from vendors was deferred into inventory to be recognized as inventory is sold 
deferred catalog advertising costs we accumulate all direct costs incurred in the development  production  and circulation of our direct mail catalogs on our consolidated balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
these capitalized costs are subsequently amortized as a component of cost of goods sold  buying  catalog  and occupancy expenses over the expected sales realization cycle  generally within one to six months 
our initial estimation of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog merchandise offering is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales and sell through experience with similar catalog merchandise offerings  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  our assessment of prevailing economic conditions  and various competitive factors 
we continually track our subsequent sales realization  compile customer feedback for indications of future performance  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to our previous estimate  and adjust our amortization accordingly 
a significant change in our expected sales and sell through experience could have a material impact on the rate of amortization of deferred catalog advertising costs 

table of contents impairment of property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  and intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant  and equipment and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 we are required to assess our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we consider historical performance and estimated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment  and compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
our estimate of fair value is generally based on either appraised value or the present value of future cash flows  based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
we test our goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment 
we performed this annual review during the fourth quarters of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal and determined that there has been no impairment of these assets 
if actual experience were to differ materially from the assumptions  estimates  and projections used to determine useful lives or the valuation of property  plant  equipment  or intangible assets  a write down for impairment of the carrying value of the assets  or acceleration of depreciation or amortization of the assets  could result 
such a write down or acceleration of depreciation or amortization could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
we assign to all identifiable assets acquired including intangible assets  and to all identifiable liabilities assumed  a portion of the cost of the acquired company equal to the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed  if any  as goodwill 
we make the initial purchase price allocation based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined  we make appropriate adjustments to the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and make corresponding changes to the amount allocated to goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 

table of contents asset securitization asset securitization primarily involves the sale of proprietary credit card receivables to a special purpose entity  which in turn transfers the receivables to a separate and distinct qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the qspe s assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet and the receivables transferred to the qspes are isolated for purposes of the securitization program 
we use asset securitization to fund the credit card receivables generated by our fashion bug  catherines  petite sophisticate  and crosstown traders proprietary credit card programs
