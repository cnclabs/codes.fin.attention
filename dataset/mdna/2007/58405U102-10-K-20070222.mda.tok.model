principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries 
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence  but neither a controlling interest nor a majority interest in the risks or rewards of the investee  are accounted for using the equity method 
the company s equity investments are not significant 
intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash includes currency on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions 
cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
as a result of the company s normal payment cycle  cash disbursement accounts representing outstanding checks not yet presented for payment of  million and  million have been reclassified to cash  and claims and other accounts payable at december  and december   respectively 
no overdraft or unsecured short term loan exists in relation to these negative balances 
short term investments 
the company has investments in us government securities that are carried at fair value and classified as available for sale  with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of equity  net of tax 
these investments  totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively  have maturities of less than one year and are held to satisfy the statutory capital and other requirements for the company s insurance subsidiaries 
financial instruments 
the carrying amount of cash  short term investments in marketable securities  trade accounts receivable and claims and other accounts payable approximated fair values as of december  and december  the company estimates fair market value for these assets and liabilities based on their market values or estimates of the present value of their cash flows 
the fair value of the company s million senior notes was million and million at december  and december   respectively  and was estimated based on quoted market prices

see note  debt and refinancing  for additional information 
manufacturer accounts receivable  net 
manufacturer accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers for earned rebates and other prescription services 
unbilled rebates receivable 
table of contents from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
as of december  and december   total unbilled receivables from manufacturers amounted to million and million  respectively  reflecting the timing associated with the quarterly contractual billing schedule with manufacturers 
client accounts receivable  net 
client accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from clients for the pbm and specialty pharmacy business 
unbilled pbm receivables from clients are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of any given reporting period  unbilled pbm receivables from clients may represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
client accounts receivable  net  also includes a credit for rebates and guarantees payable to clients when such are settled on a net basis in the form of an invoice credit 
in cases where rebates and guarantees are settled with the client on a net basis  and the rebates and guarantees payable are greater than the corresponding client accounts balances  the net liability is reclassified to client rebates and guarantees payable 
when these payables are settled in the form of a check or wire  they are recorded on a gross basis and the entire liability is reflected in client rebates and guarantees payable 
the company s client accounts receivable also include premiums receivable  which are comprised of amounts from the center for medicare medicaid services cms for the medicare part d prescription drug program pdp product offering and premiums from members 
a portion of the specialty pharmacy business includes reimbursement by payors  such as insurance companies  under a medical benefit  or by medicare or medicaid 
these transactions also involve higher patient co payments than experienced in the pbm business 
as a result of these characteristics  this portion of the specialty pharmacy business  which yields a higher margin than the pbm business  experiences slower accounts receivable turnover than in the aforementioned pbm cycle 
as of december  and december   total unbilled receivables from clients amounted to  million and  million  respectively  reflecting the timing of billing cycles 
as of december  and december   identified specialty pharmacy client accounts receivable from payors and patients amounted to million and million  respectively 
client accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances of million at december  and million at december   including million and million  respectively  for specialty pharmacy 
the relatively higher allowance for specialty pharmacy reflects a different credit risk profile than the pbm business  characterized by reimbursement through medical coverage  including government agencies  and higher patient co payments 
in addition  for  the allowance also reflects amounts associated with member premiums for the company s medicare part d product offering 
the company regularly reviews and analyzes the adequacy of the allowances based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted 
see note  segment reporting  for more information on the specialty pharmacy segment 
concentrations of risks 
in each of and  the company had one client that represented of net revenues 
in  this client represented of net revenues 
none of the company s other clients individually represented more than of net revenues in  or the company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable  which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies  insurance companies and private patients 
concentration of credit risk relating to these accounts receivable is limited by the diversity and number of patients and payors 
the company derives a substantial portion of its specialty pharmacy segment revenue from the sale of specialty drugs provided by a limited number of single source biopharmaceutical manufacturers 
inventories  net 
inventories  net  are located in the company s mail order pharmacies and in warehouses  consist solely of finished product primarily prescription drugs  and are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment  net  is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives ranging from three to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  certain costs of 
table of contents computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients and members  either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies 
the majority of the company s product net revenues are derived on a fee for service basis 
specialty pharmacy product net revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors and patients 
the company recognizes product revenues when the prescriptions are dispensed through retail pharmacies in the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies and received by members and patients 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent eitf  to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 
the company s product net revenues also include premiums associated with the company s medicare part d pdp product offering 
this product involves prescription dispensing for members covered under the cms sponsored medicare part d benefit 
commencing january   the company began serving as a plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage pursuant to two contracts by and between cms and two of the company s insurance company subsidiaries 
the company provides a standard drug benefit that represents either i the minimum level of benefits mandated by congress  or ii enhanced coverage  on behalf of certain clients  which represents benefits in excess of the standard drug benefit in exchange for additional premiums 
the pdp premiums are determined based on the company s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms 
the pdp premiums are primarily comprised of amounts received from cms as part of a direct subsidy and an additional subsidy from cms for low income member premiums  as well as premium payments received from members 
these premiums are recognized ratably to product net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 
premiums received in advance of the applicable benefit period are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
there is a possibility that the annual costs of drugs may be higher or lower than premium revenues 
as a result  cms provides a risk corridor adjustment for the standard drug benefit that compares the company s actual annual drug costs incurred to the targeted premiums in the company s cms approved bid 
based on specific collars in the risk corridor  the company will receive from cms additional premium amounts or be required to refund to cms previously received premium amounts 
the company calculates the risk corridor adjustment on a quarterly basis based on drug cost experience to date and records an adjustment to product net revenues with a corresponding account receivable or payable to cms reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
for  premium revenues for the company s pdp product were million  or approximately of total net revenues of billion 
in addition to premiums  there are certain co payments and deductibles the cost share due by members based on prescription orders by those members  some of which are subsidized by cms in cases of low income membership 
the subsidy amounts received in advance are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the contract term and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  subsidies are reconciled with actual costs and residual subsidy advance receipts are payable to cms 
the cost share is treated consistently as other co payments derived from providing pbm services  as a component of product net revenues in the consolidated statements of income where the requirements of eitf are met 

table of contents the company s agreements with cms  as well as applicable medicare part d regulations and federal and state laws  require the company to  among other obligations i comply with certain disclosure  filing  record keeping and marketing rules  ii operate quality assurance  drug utilization management and medication therapy management programs  iii support e prescribing initiatives  iv implement grievance  appeals and formulary exception processes  v comply with payment protocols  which include the return of overpayments to cms and  in certain circumstances  coordination with state pharmacy assistance programs  vi use approved networks and formularies  and provide access to such networks to any willing pharmacy  vii provide emergency out of network coverage  and viii adopt a comprehensive medicare and fraud  waste and abuse compliance program 
contractual or regulatory non compliance may entail significant sanctions and monetary penalties 
rebates and guarantees regarding the level of service the company will provide to the client or member or the minimum level of rebates or discounts the client will receive are deducted from product net revenue as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally credited or paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent only a variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenue  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
service revenues consist principally of administrative fees and clinical program fees earned from clients and other non product related revenues  sales of prescription services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and data to other parties  and performance oriented fees paid by specialty pharmacy manufacturers 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  along with direct dispensing costs and associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail network and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these bills are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data is received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
the company s cost of product net revenues also includes the cost of drugs dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies or retail network for members covered under the company s medicare part d pdp product offering and are recorded at cost as incurred 
the company receives a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy from cms for approximately of costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out of pocket maximum of  the threshold applicable for 
the subsidy is reflected as an offsetting credit in cost of product net revenues to the extent that catastrophic costs are incurred 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy amounts received in advance are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the contract term and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  residual subsidy advance receipts are payable to cms 
cost of service revenues consists principally of labor and operating costs for delivery of services provided  and costs associated with member communication materials 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill of  million at december  and  million at december  represents  for the pbm business  the push down of the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets from the acquisition of the company by merck in  and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of provantage health services  inc provantage  in goodwill also includes  for the specialty pharmacy business  a portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over tangible net assets acquired and  to a significantly lesser extent  a portion of the excess of the purchase price over tangible net assets related to the acquisition of selected assets of pediatric services of america  inc pediatric services in see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
the company tests its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events  such as a protracted decline in the company s stock price or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  using a two step fair value based test 
the most recent assessment of goodwill impairment for each of the designated reporting units was performed as of september   and the recorded goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
intangible assets  net 
intangible assets  net  of  million at december  and  million at december   net of accumulated amortization of  million at december  and  million at december  primarily reflect  for the pbm business  the value of client relationships that arose in connection with the acquisition of the company by merck in and that have been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company  and also include  for the specialty pharmacy business  the portion of the excess of the accredo purchase price over tangible net assets acquired that has been allocated to intangible assets 
see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information 
these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients or biotechnology manufacturer contracts  or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the pre tax undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings 
if this comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
effective with the accredo acquisition on august   the weighted average useful life of intangible assets subject to amortization is years in total and by major asset class are approximately years for the pbm client relationships and approximately years for the accredo intangibles  with the annual intangible amortization expense increasing to million in from an annual amount of million prior to the acquisition

recent accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in companies financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition whereby companies must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the second step is measurement whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of recognized tax benefits  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier adoption is only permitted at the beginning of a company s fiscal year  provided that interim financial statements for that fiscal year have not yet been issued

the expected impact may change based on further analysis 
subsequent to the adoption  any additional reserve reductions will be reflected in the provision for income taxes

segment reporting reportable segments 
as a result of the company s acquisition of accredo on august   the company has two reportable segments  pbm and specialty pharmacy 
the pbm segment involves sales of traditional prescription drugs to the company s clients and members  either through the company s network of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies 
the specialty pharmacy segment  which was formed upon the accredo acquisition  includes the sale of higher margin specialty pharmacy products and services for the treatment of chronic and potentially life threatening diseases 
the results of accredo are included in the specialty pharmacy segment results and the consolidated statements of income effective with the august  acquisition 
the specialty pharmacy segment also includes the specialty pharmacy activity previously included within medco s pbm business 
the company defines the specialty pharmacy segment based on a product set and associated services  broadly characterized to include drugs that are high cost  usually developed by biotechnology companies and often injectable  and which require elevated levels of patient support 
when dispensed  these products frequently require a significant amount of ancillary administration equipment  special packaging  and a much higher degree of patient oriented customer service than is required in the traditional pbm business model 
in addition  specialty pharmacy products and services are often covered through medical benefit programs with the primary payors being insurance companies and government programs  along with patients  as well as pbm clients as payors 
factors used to identify reportable segments 
the specialty pharmacy segment was formed as a result of the accredo acquisition on august  in response to a management desire to manage the acquired business together with medco s pre existing specialty pharmacy activity as a separate business from medco s pbm operations 
this acquisition complemented the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy operation  which was evolving in prior to the acquisition  results for the specialty pharmacy business were neither prepared nor provided to the chief operating decision maker as he managed medco on a consolidated entity level 
during  medco established procedures and controls and implemented system solutions in order to identify discrete financial information on a prospective basis for the specialty pharmacy activities in anticipation of the combination of those activities with accredo into a separate segment  effective with the closing of the accredo acquisition 
until these procedures  controls and systems were implemented during  the complexity of the company s manufacturer and client contracts  determining the appropriate cost of inventory and retail reimbursement  as 
table of contents well as the shared costs between the pbm and specialty pharmacy activities prevented medco from preparing detailed separate profitability financial results for specialty pharmacy for periods prior to the formation of the segment in august of selected segment income and asset information 
total net revenues and operating income are measures used by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of each of the company s operating segments 
as described above  the company s acquisition of accredo resulted in the establishment of the specialty pharmacy segment  hence the specialty pharmacy segment activity commenced with the accredo acquisition date 
medco identified the revenues associated with the specialty pharmacy business based on a data extract of sales for the specialty product set 
the following table presents selected financial information about the company s reportable segments  including a reconciliation of operating income to income before provision for income taxes in millions for fiscal years ended december  december  pbm specialty pharmacy total pbm specialty pharmacy total product net revenues total service revenues total net revenues total cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles operating income reconciling item to income before provision for income taxes interest and other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes capital expenditures week fiscal year 
includes eight fiscal months of specialty pharmacy activity previously included in medco s pbm business 
the specialty pharmacy segment commenced on august   the date of the accredo acquisition 
if the company had owned accredo for the full fiscal year ended december   it is estimated that the specialty pharmacy segment net revenues would represent approximately of total medco net revenues 
identifiable assets as of december  as of december  pbm specialty pharmacy total pbm specialty pharmacy total total identifiable assets the company estimates that the specialty pharmacy results of operations  including the effect of the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy results of operations  reflect approximately billion in total net revenues and approximately million in operating income for the full fiscal year ended december  for the year ended december   the company estimates that net revenues for the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy results of operations were approximately billion with operating income estimated at million 
medco calculated the estimated full year operating income for fiscal year based on the best information available for the pre acquisition period and the detailed post acquisition segment results 
in estimating the operating income  medco utilized the overall pbm operating income as a percentage to revenue 
the operating income estimates for the pre existing medco specialty pharmacy operations approximate the overall pbm operating income as a percentage to revenue as the product pricing and service model was substantially consistent with the overall pbm business in that period 
medco s operating results for fiscal year  excluding the effect of the accredo acquisition  would have reflected  million in net revenues  and million in operating income

to the extent that the company is required to indemnify merck for liabilities arising out of a lawsuit  an adverse outcome with respect to merck could result in the company making indemnification payments in amounts that could be material  in addition to any damages that the company is required to pay 
the company is also involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to the company s business  principally employment and commercial matters 
the various lawsuits described above arise in an environment of rising costs for prescription drugs and continued public scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry  including the pbm and specialty pharmacy industries and their practices

these factors contribute to the uncertainty regarding the possible course and outcome of the proceedings discussed above 
an adverse outcome in any one of the lawsuits described above could result in material fines and damages  changes to the company s business practices  loss of or litigation with clients  and other penalties
