item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses bad debt expenses restructuring charges acquisition termination costs income from operations income before provision for taxes on income  minority interests and discontinued operations provision for taxes on income minority interests income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income executive summary proved to be a difficult year for the company 
although we achieved many milestones such as exceeding billion in sales and sold more than million tons of pcc  we were unable to leverage our increase in sales to improved operating income performance 
this was primarily because of unrecovered raw material and energy cost increases  paper mill and paper machine shutdowns  and weakness in our end use markets  particularly in the fourth quarter 
at the same time  we continued to invest heavily in development programs such as pcc for paper coating in europe  our synsil products for the glass industry  and filler fiber composites for paper filling 
worldwide net sales for grew over the prior year from million to billion 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of less than percentage point of growth 
operating income for the full year increased to million from million in the prior year 
operating income represented of sales in and was of sales in income from continuing operations decreased to million from million in the prior year 
net income for the full year declined to million from million in our operating income and net income has been affected by a number of factors over the past year 
the positive factors affecting the operating income and net income were primarily attributable to the following increased profitability in the refractory products and systems product line  particularly in north america and europe  due to strong demand through the first nine months of the year and lower costs achieved through product reformulations  improved operations at our new satellite pcc facilities in china  increased worldwide demand for pcc in all regions  and volume growth from expansions of existing pcc facilities in europe  and royalty income and reduced litigation expenses from the settlement of patent litigation 
the company will receive additional royalty income of approximately million per annum through this growth was partially mitigated by the following factors unrecovered cost increases in the pcc product line due to the delayed pass through of lim bb e cost increases  paper mill and paper machine shutdowns affecting several satellite pcc facilities  operating losses in our synsil products line primarily due to initial startup costs associated with our manufacturing facility in south carolina  unrecovered energy cost increases and significant weakness in the end use markets during the fourth quarter of in the processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines  increased compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  decreased margins in the metallurgical product line  and during the fourth quarter of  we also recognized a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million related to foreign currency translation losses arising from the liquidation of our investment in israel 
the net effect of the aforementioned factors resulted in operating income growth of approximately over  and a decline in net income of approximately from we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our success depends in part on the performance of the industries we serve  particularly papermaking and steel making 
some of our customers may continue to experience consolidations and shutdowns  consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc  most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us  we are subject to cost fluctuations on raw materials  including shipping costs  particularly on magnesia and talc imported from china  we have experienced increased energy costs in both of our business segments that we may not be able to pass through to our customers  although the synsil products family has received favorable reactions from current and potential customers  this product line is not yet profitable 
to date  the introduction of synsil technology to customers has progressed more slowly than anticipated  resulting in temporary overcapacity at our facilities 
the manufacturing facilities are strategically located in major market areas for glass making  and we believe our products provide a suitable value equation for glass manufacturers 
however  the commercial viability of this product line cannot be assured 
the cost of employee benefits  particularly health coverage  has risen significantly in recent years and continues to do so  and as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
despite these risks and challenges  we are optimistic about the opportunities for continued growth that are open to us  including increasing our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  increasing our sales of pcc for paper coating  particularly from our merchant coating pcc facilities in walsum  germany and hermalle  belgium  achieving commercialization of a filler fiber composite technology for the paper industry through our continued research and development activities  developing new satellite pcc opportunities  achieving continued market acceptance of the synsil products family of composite minerals for the glass industry  continuing our penetration in emerging markets  including our new manufacturing facility in china and our recent acquisition in turkey in the refractories segment  and increasing market penetration in the refractories segment through development of high performance products and equipment systems 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these programs 
on july   the company s largest customer  international paper company ip  announced a general plan to restructure certain elements of its businesses 
as a result  ip sold its coated and super calendered papers business  including four paper mills  to verso paper holdings llc verso  an affiliate of apollo management lp 
the company owns and operates pcc satellite facilities at two of those paper mills  jay  maine  and quinnesec  michigan  pursuant to pcc supply contracts  which were transferred by ip to verso in this transaction has not affected the company s pcc satellite operations or assets 
on march   the company temporarily ceased operation of a one unit satellite pcc facility in park falls  wisconsin  after the paper company shut down its mill and filed for bankruptcy protection 
the company recorded a provision for bad debt of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with this bankruptcy 
the paper mill has since been sold to flambeau river papers  llc and we resumed production pursuant to a long term supply contract from our satellite pcc facility in the third quarter 
as expected  in april  the company ceased operation of a one unit satellite pcc facility in hadera  israel

paper pcc volumes grew for the full year with volumes in excess of million tons 
in  worldwide printing and writing paper production totaled approximately million metric tons and increased over uncoated freesheet  currently our largest pcc market  increased an estimated in paper pcc sales growth was achieved in all regions with the largest growth occurring in asia 
this was primarily attributable to the ramp up of two new satellite pcc plants in china  which represented approximately percentage points of the volume growth 
worldwide demand for uncoated freesheet and expansions of satellite pcc facilities in europe more than offset paper mill and paper machine shutdowns affecting several satellite pcc facilities 
sales of specialty pcc grew to million from million in worldwide net sales of pcc increased in to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of paper pcc increased to million while paper pcc volumes grew 
in  sales growth was achieved in all regions  except latin america  with the largest growth occurring in europe and asia where sales volumes grew and  respectively 
sales of specialty pcc grew in to million from million due to improved volumes  particularly in automotive and health care applications 
net sales of processed minerals products in increased to million from million in talc sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to strong global demand in plastics and health care related markets 
other processed minerals products declined to million from million in the prior year 
this decline was due to weakness in the residential construction market in the second half of synsil products sales increased to million due to the initial sales from our new facility in chester  south carolina 
processed minerals net sales in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to strong demand in the residential construction markets 
net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of refractory products and systems to steel and other industrial applications increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth was attributable primarily to increased volume in north america during the first nine months of and in europe throughout the year 
in addition  approximately percentage points of growth was due to the recent acquisition of a refractory producer in turkey 
sales of metallurgical products within the refractories segment decreased to million from million in the prior year 
this decline was due to lower selling prices as raw material cost reductions were passed on to customers 
volumes also declined  particularly in the fourth quarter in north america  due to weakness in the steel industry 
net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
foreign exchange represented approximately percentage point of the sales growth 
the sales growth was driven globally by the metallurgical product line in which sales grew to million from million 
this increase was attributable to a combination of price increases  due to the substantial escalation in the cost of raw materials for this product line  as well as volume growth 
sales of refractory products and systems to steel and other industrial applications decreased to million from million 
net sales in the united states increased approximately to million in and represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
international sales increased approximately to million

operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing and administrative research and development bad debt expenses acquisition termination costs restructuring charges write down of impaired assets percentage not meaningful cost of goods sold in was of sales compared with in the prior year 
our cost of goods sold grew which had a slightly unfavorable leveraging impact on our sales growth resulting in a increase in production margin 
this unfavorable leveraging occurred in the specialty minerals segment where production margins increased as compared with sales growth 
margins in this segment were affected by several factors unrecovered lime cost increases in the pcc product line  paper machine and paper mill shutdowns  production losses in our synsil products line primarily due to initial startup costs associated with our new facility in south carolina  and unrecovered energy cost increases in the processed minerals product line 
collectively  these factors had an adverse impact on production margin and operating income  as compared with the prior year  by approximately million 
these negative factors largely offset the improvements in each of the following areas ramp up of our two new satellite pcc facilities in china  increased demand for pcc  particularly in north america  cost reduction initiatives  and expansions of satellite pcc facilities in europe 
in the refractories segment  production margin increased over the prior year as compared with sales growth 
this was primarily due to improved steel industry operating conditions in our primary markets during the first nine months and cost reduction initiatives through the reformulation of refractory products 
cost of goods sold in was of sales compared with in our cost of goods sold grew which had an unfavorable leveraging impact on our sales growth resulting in a decrease in production margin 
this unfavorable leveraging occurred in both reporting segments 
in the specialty minerals segment  production margins declined as compared with sales growth 
margins in this segment were affected by several factors start up and ramp up costs related to the european coating market development program  the effects of continuing paper industry capacity rationalization  which lowered demand at several satellite plants  unrecovered raw material and energy costs  and start up and ramp up costs at two new facilities in china 
marketing and administrative costs increased in to million and represented of net sales 
this was primarily due to increased worldwide infrastructure costs and other employee benefits  including increased stock option expense of approximately million relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we also experienced a reduction in litigation expenses in of approximately million 
in  marketing and administrative costs increased over to million and represented of sales 
we incurred higher litigation costs in to protect our intellectual property 
this litigation was settled in the fourth quarter of resulting in non operating income of million  while the costs of such litigation were included in marketing and administrative expenses

in  research and development expenses remained flat at million and also represented of net sales 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  bad debt expenses increased due to additional customer bankruptcies 
in  the reduction in bad debt charges was primarily related to recoveries of bad debt in excess of provisions 
in  the provision for bad debt was net of recoveries of approximately million related to steel company bankruptcies  in which we had previously written off the related accounts receivable 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of impaired assets of million 
the impairment related to the closure in the first quarter of our satellite facility in cornwall  ontario  resulting from the paper mill shutdown 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized million in pre tax corporate charges related to due diligence costs from a terminated acquisition effort 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency 
this resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
as part of that restructuring program  we recorded million in additional charges in the restructuring charges relate to workforce reductions from all business units throughout our worldwide operations and the termination of certain leases 
there were no restructuring costs in or income from operations dollars in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in increased to million from million in and was of sales as compared with of sales in income from operations in decreased to million from million in and was of sales as compared with of sales in income from operations for the specialty minerals segment increased slightly to million and was of its net sales 
unfavorable leveraging to operating income for this segment was primarily due to the aforementioned factors affecting production margin 
operating income for the refractories segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
this was primarily attributable to increased profitability of refractories products and systems partially offset by a reduction in profitability in metallurgical products 
in addition  this segment benefited from a pension settlement and curtailment gain of approximately million in asia 
in  income from operations for the specialty minerals segment decreased to million and was of its net sales 
operating income for the refractories segment decreased to million and was of its net sales 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions increased from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased interest expense of million over due to increased borrowings 
in addition  in we recognized an insurance settlement gain of approximately million for property damage sustained at one of our facilities 
in  we recognized a litigation settlement gain of million 
provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the effective tax rate increased to in as compared with in this increase was primarily related to a change in the mix of earnings  an increase in the valuation allowance due to ohio tax reform legislation and the impact of fas r

net income dollars in millions growth growth net income net income decreased in to million 
earnings per share on a diluted basis decreased to per share in as compared with per share in the prior year 
outlook we are presently experiencing weakness in the primary industries we serve paper  construction and steel 
there were several paper machine shutdowns that affect our satellite pcc product line as the paper industry continues to consolidate and rationalize capacity 
there is continued softening in the residential construction and automotive markets and we are faced with low steel capacity utilization rates in the united states  our largest market 
we expect this weakness to continue into the first half of in  we plan to focus on the following growth strategies expand regionally into emerging markets where we have a limited presence 
increase our presence in regional markets where the manufacturing of paper and steel is shifting  particularly china and eastern europe 
increase market penetration of pcc in paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills 
increase penetration of pcc into the paper coating market 
continue research and development activities for new products  including commercialization of a filler fiber composite technology for the paper industry 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
continue research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products  including the synsil products family of composite minerals 
continue to improve our cost competitiveness 
continue selective acquisitions to complement our existing businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the following are notable events that may impact our performance we began operations from our new synsil products production facility in the first quarter of and our operating losses for this product line increased million in  primarily as a result of low volume and startup costs 
we expect to commence production from a second facility in cleburne  texas  in the first quarter of the introduction of synsil technology to consumers has progressed more slowly than anticipated  resulting in temporary overcapacity at our facilities 
the manufacturing facilities are strategically located in major market areas for glass making  and we believe our products provide a suitable value equation for glass manufacturers 
however  this product line continues to operate at a significant loss which is expected to continue into until volumes at our two new facilities increase 
the net book value of the long lived assets at the synsil facilities were approximately million as of december  in  we expected a significant acceleration of our coating program with improved volumes from our merchant paper coating pcc facilities in walsum  germany and hermalle  belgium 
while volumes improved  they were well short of the company s expectations and the coating development program in europe continues to operate at a significant loss 
we expect these operations to improve in the net book value of the long lived assets at these facilities were approximately million as of december  we began operation of a  ton capacity refractory manufacturing facility in china during the third quarter of we expect this facility to ramp up in in october  we acquired asmas  an istanbul based turkish producer of refractories based in istanbul  turkey 
this acquisition provides our refractories segment with an experienced organization and a strong market position in turkey  as well as excellent manufacturing capabilities and internal access to our key raw material  magnesia 
this acquisition will enable us to service the rapidly growing markets in the middle east and eastern europe 
as we continue to expand our operations overseas  we face the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems and other factors 
some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  brazil  thailand  china and south africa 
in addition  our performance depends to some extent on that of the industries we serve  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially about ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements generally have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future sales growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate and  if not renewed  could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows in were provided from operations and long term and short term financing and were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  an acquisition of a refractories business for approximately million  and million for purchases of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities amounted to million in as compared with million in the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to an improvement of working capital  as compared to the prior year 
our accounts receivables grew at a lower rate than sales and our days of sales outstanding decreased to days from days in the prior year 
growth in inventories were primarily attributable to the timing of raw materials purchases and increased inventories resulting from our recent acquisition 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to utilize our cash reserves to support the aforementioned growth strategies 
on october   our board of directors authorized our management committee  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
as of may   the company had repurchased  shares under this program at an average price of per share 
on october   our company s board of directors authorized the company s management committee  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment 
at december   we had million in guaranteed senior notes that matured on july  on october   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal of senior notes due october   consisting of a million aggregate principal amount series a senior notes  and b million aggregate principal amount floating rate series a senior notes 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  in addition  we have an million committed short term bank credit line  all of which was in use at december  we anticipate that capital expenditures for should approximate million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  nil  thereafter million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million provision in was net of million of bad debt recoveries related to steel customer bankruptcies for previously written off accounts receivable 
the charges in were much higher than historical levels and were primarily related to bankruptcy filings by some of our customers in the paper and steel industries and to additional provisions associated with risks in the paper  steel and other industries 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we principally measure any impairment by our ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects effect on expense dollars in millions discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation thousands of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements for stock options granted on and subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
as provided under the modified prospective method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical implied volatility of the company s stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would change approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set our anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and the accuracy of assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions in item a  risk factors 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on our financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement will apply to all other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently completing an analysis of the ultimate impact the new pronouncement will have on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continued to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between february and july of the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was a liability of million and million  respectively
