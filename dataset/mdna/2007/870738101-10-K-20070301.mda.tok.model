item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
the following information contains forward looking statement  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview swift energy had record net income  cash flow  and production for net income increased to million and cash flow from operations increased to million  in each case compared to amounts 
production increased to bcfe over hurricane affected production a year earlier  principally attributable to our continued success in lake washington  with our production increase matching in one year our cumulative production increase over the prior three years 
we ended with total proved reserves of bcfe  an increase of over year end reserves 
we also had record revenues of million for  an increase of over levels 
our weighted average sales price increased to per mcfe for from in of our million increase in oil and gas sales revenues  came from a million barrel increase in oil volumes produced  with the remainder attributable to higher oil prices during our capital expenditures more than doubled from to  principally due to our acquisition of five substantial onshore properties in south louisiana from bp america production company for million in cash and the increase in our spending on drilling and development  predominantly in our south louisiana region 
although the acquisition did not appreciably add to our production volumes  it added bcfe of proved reserves  about one third of which were proved undeveloped  resulting in our proved undeveloped reserves increasing to of total reserves at year end  compared to the previous year 
our overall costs and expenses increased in by 
in  we will focus upon our capital efficiency by managing our costs and expenses  always a difficult task in the inflationary cost environment prevalent in the industry over the last several years  and especially over the last year when recent declines in commodity prices have not been matched by comparable declines in prices of oilfield equipment and services 
the largest increase in these costs and expenses is due to increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  not only due to our larger depletable property base and higher production  but also due to increases in future development costs to reflect industry inflation 
we expect cost pressures to continue to affect the industry throughout  with tightening availability of crews as well as increasing costs of services and basic equipment 
our year end proved reserves were crude oil  natural gas  and ngls  almost identical to the percentage splits a year earlier 
our production  however  was crude oil  up from in  which allowed us to take advantage of the over increase in oil prices  while natural gas prices fell during the year 
domestic proved reserves increased at year end to bcfe of our total proved reserves  while proved reserves in new zealand decreased to bcfe at year end  primarily attributable to production 
for  we are considering conducting an expanded d seismic survey in new zealand prior to continuing drilling activities 
our financial position remains strong 
our debt to capitalization ratio was at december   compared to at year end  as debt levels increased in and retained earnings increased as a result of the current period profit  with net debt per mcfe of per mcfe at year end our debt to pv ratio increased to at december  compared to at december   primarily due to lower natural gas prices at year end and an increase in our total debt  partially offset by higher oil and natural gas reserves volumes 
lower year end commodity prices  principally natural gas  decreased our pv value and standardized measure at the end of compared to the prior year end 
our current capital expenditure budget is million to million  net of minor non core dispositions and excluding any property acquisitions 
approximately of the budget is targeted for domestic activities  predominantly in our south louisiana region  with about planned for activities in the new zealand region 
for  we are targeting total production to increase to and proved reserves to increase to over levels 
we may also increase our capital expenditure budget if commodity prices rise during the year or if strategic opportunities warrant 
if capital expenditures exceed our cash flow from operating activities  we can fund these expenditures with our credit facility to fund these expenditures 
during  we plan to further develop our inventory of properties in south louisiana using our expertise and experience gained in expanding and producing in lake washington  together with significant d seismic information  to exploit our other prospect areas covered by similar geological features 
this broad prospect inventory will allow us to be selective in choosing drilling opportunities so we can create long life reserves while at the same time raising our production significantly  which we did during mainly through organic production growth 
results of operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in primarily due to increases in oil production from our lake washington area and increases in oil prices  and our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due primarily to increases in oil and natural gas prices and in production from our lake washington and rimu kauri areas

in  we settled all insurance claims with our insurers relating to hurricanes katrina and rita for approximately million and entered into a confidential final settlement agreement 
the receipt of these amounts resulted in a benefit of million in recorded in price risk management and other  net  for the portion of the above referenced settlement  which we have determined to be non property damage related claims 
approximately million of the above referenced settlement was determined to be property damage related claims 
we recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to proved properties on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  as this related to reimbursement of capital costs we incurred 
we also recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to lease operating cost on the accompanying consolidated statement of income  as this related to reimbursement of repair costs which had been expensed as incurred 
in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows  we have recorded the reimbursement which reduced proved properties as a reduction of net cash used in investing activities and the remainder of the insurance settlement was recorded as an increase to net cash provided by operating activities 
costs and expenses 
our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to a million increase in dd a  a million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in lease operating costs  all of which are primarily due to increased production volumes in increased commodity prices also increased severance and other taxes  and higher full cost pool balances increased dd a  offset somewhat by increased reserves volumes in our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to a million increase in dd a  an million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in lease operating costs  all of which are primarily due to increased commodity prices and production volumes in this increase was partially offset by the absence of million of debt retirement costs incurred in our general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the increase in both and were primarily due to increased salaries and burdens associated with our expanded workforce 
costs also increased in as a result of expensing stock options and increased restricted stock grants  and increased in due to restricted stock compensation 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a increased million  or  in from levels  while dd a increased million  or  from levels 
domestically  dd a increased million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base and higher production  partially offset by higher reserves volumes 
in new zealand  dd a increased by million in due to an increase in the depletable oil and gas property base and lower reserves 
in  our domestic dd a increased million due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  slightly higher production in the period and lower reserves volumes 
in new zealand  dd a increased by million in due to the same reasons 
our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million  million  and million of accretions to our asset retirement obligation in   and  respectively 
our lease operating costs per mcfe produced were in  in and in our lease operating costs in increased million  or  over the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over levels 
approximately million of the increase in lease operating costs during was related to our domestic operations  which increased primarily due to increased production and was also impacted by increased well insurance premiums 
our lease operating cost in new zealand increased in by million due to increases in well operating costs and storage and handling costs 
severance and other taxes increased million  or  over levels  while in these taxes increased million  or over levels 
the increases were due primarily to higher commodity prices and increased lake washington production in each of the periods 
severance taxes on oil in louisiana are of oil sales  which is higher than in the other states where we have production 
as our percentage of oil production in louisiana increases  the overall percentage of severance costs to sales also increases 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively

interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and and million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled the same million in   and interest expense on our senior subordinated notes issued in august and repurchased and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the decrease of interest expense in was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest costs  partially offset by an increase in credit facility interest 
the decrease of interest expense in was primarily due to the lower interest rate applicable to the notes issued in june versus the notes retired at that time 
in  we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the repurchase and redemption of our senior subordinated notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs  million to write off unamortized debt discount and approximately million of other costs 
our overall effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rate for was higher than the statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes and a valuation allowance  partially offset by favorable adjustments for the currency effect on the new zealand deferred tax calculation 
for  the effective rate was about the same as the statutory rate as state income taxes and the currency effect adjustments essentially offset 
for  the effective rate was less than the statutory rate due to favorable adjustments for currency effect and corrections to tax basis amounts  partially offset by deferred state income taxes 
net income 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher oil prices and increased production 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production

the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of oil has increased over the last two years and is at historical highs when compared to longer term historical prices 
factors such as worldwide supply disruptions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  and political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices continue to remain high when compared to longer term historical prices 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
income tax regulations the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ

during  we largely relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher oil prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil prices and higher domestic production 
in  our net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher commodity prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs due to higher domestic production and severance taxes as a result of higher commodity prices 
accounts receivable 
we assess the collectibility of accounts receivable  and  based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at both december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of less than million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying balance sheets 
existing credit facility 
we had borrowings of million under our bank credit facility at december   and no outstanding borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was reaffirmed by our bank group at million  effective november  under the terms of our bank credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
our access to funds from our credit facility is not restricted under any material adverse condition clause  a clause that is common for credit agreements to include 
a material adverse condition clause can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have an adverse or material effect on operations  financial condition  prospects or properties  and would impair the ability to make timely debt repayments 
our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report events or conditions having a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
working capital 
our working capital declined from a surplus of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to property acquisitions during the fourth quarter of debt maturities 
our credit facility  with a balance of million at december   extends until october  our million of senior notes mature july   and our million of senior subordinated notes mature may  on or after may   we are entitled to redeem our million of senior subordinated notes at a redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest  of of principal 
if these notes were redeemed  we would most likely use a combination of drawings upon our credit facility  cash flows from operations  and the use of debt and or equity offerings to fund any such redemption 
capital expenditures 
in we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of  credit facility borrowings of million  property sales proceeds of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
our total capital expenditures of approximately million in included domestic expenditures of million as follows o million for drilling and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our south louisiana area  o million for acquisitions of properties  primarily in our south louisiana area  o million on exploratory drilling  o million of domestic prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  d seismic activity  and geological costs of unproved prospects  o million primarily for leasehold improvements  computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures  new zealand expenditures of million as follows o million for drilling costs and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our rimu kauri area  o million on exploratory drilling  o million on prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  seismic and geological costs of unproved properties  o million for computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures 
we continue to spend considerable time and capital on facility capacity upgrades in the lake washington field  and increased facility capacity at year end to approximately  barrels per day for crude oil  up from  barrels per day capacity in the first quarter of we have upgraded three production platforms  added new compression for the gas lift system  and installed a new oil delivery system and permanent barge loading facility 
during  we began planning for the addition of a fourth production platform which will increase our processing capacity another  barrels per day by mid we completed of wells in  for a success rate of 
domestically  we completed of development wells for a success rate of and were unsuccessful on six exploratory wells  including five very shallow exploration wells in the awp olmos area which cost million in the aggregate  and one non operated well in alaska 
a total of development wells were drilled in the lake washington area  of which were completed  and development wells were drilled in the awp olmos area  of which were completed 
we also drilled six development wells in the bay de chene area  of which three were completed  drilled three successful development wells in each of the cote blanche island and south bearhead creek areas  and drilled one successful development well in the brookeland area 
in new zealand  we completed three of four development wells but were unsuccessful on four exploratory wells 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in in  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million  including acquisitions of million 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  the issuance of our senior notes due  proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million  less the repayment of our senior subordinated notes due to fund capital expenditures of million  including acquisitions of million 
our total capital expenditures in of approximately million included domestic expenditures of million as follows o million for drilling and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our lake washington area  o million on property acquisitions  including million to acquire properties in the south bearhead creek field  o million on exploratory drilling  mainly in our lake washington area  o million of prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  d seismic activity  and geological costs of unproved prospects  o million primarily for a field office building  computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures  o million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas  and o less than million on field compression facilities

subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of certain assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
significant estimates and assumptions underlying these financial statements include o the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows there from  o accruals related to oil and gas revenues  capital expenditures and lease operating expenses  o estimates of insurance recoveries related to property damage  o estimates in the calculation of stock compensation expense  o estimates of our ownership in properties prior to final division of interest determination  o the estimated future cost and timing of asset retirement obligations  and o estimates made in our income tax calculations 
while we are not aware of any material revisions to any of our estimates  there will likely be future revisions to our estimates resulting from matters such as changes in new accounting pronouncements  ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by purchasers or pipelines  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry  many of which require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such costs may be incurred both prior to and after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  and equipment 
internal costs incurred that are directly identified with exploration  development  and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities  are also capitalized 
for the years   and  such internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs are also capitalized to unproved oil and gas properties 
for the years   and  capitalized interest on unproved properties totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties including gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
our hedges at december  consisted of natural gas price floors with strike prices higher than the period end price and did not materially affect prices used in this calculation 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
the calculation of the ceiling test and provision for dd a is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
our reserves estimates are prepared in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidelines  and  are audited on an annual basis at year end by a firm of independent petroleum engineers in accordance with standards approved by the board of directors of the society of petroleum engineers 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
if we have declines in our oil and gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
price risk management activities 
the company follows sfas no 
 which requires that changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
hedge accounting for a qualifying hedge allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  and the ineffective portion of the hedge  are recognized currently in income 
we have a price risk management policy to use derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and gas prices  mainly through the purchase of price floors and collars 
during  and  we recognized net gains of million  and net losses of million and million  respectively  relating to our derivative activities 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   the company had recorded million  net of taxes of less than million  of derivative gains in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax on the accompanying balance sheet 
this amount represents the change in fair value for the effective portion of our hedging transactions that qualified as cash flow hedges 
the ineffectiveness reported in price risk management and other  net for   and was not material 
we expect to reclassify all amounts currently held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax into the statement of income within the next three months when the forecasted sale of hedged production occurs 
at december   we had in place price floors in effect for february through the march contract month for natural gas  that cover a portion of our domestic natural gas production for february to march the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our estimated domestic natural gas production from february to march when we entered into these transactions discussed above  they were designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of natural gas production 
changes in the fair value of a hedge that is highly effective and is designated and documented and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax 
when the hedged transactions are recorded upon the actual sale of the natural gas  these gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax and recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statement of income 
the fair value of our derivatives is computed using the black scholes merton option pricing model and is periodically verified against quotes from brokers 
the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
revenue recognition 
oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectibility of the revenue is probable 
processing costs for natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls that are paid in kind are deducted from revenues 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting in which the company recognizes its ownership interest in production as revenue

asset retirement obligation 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the carrying amount of the related long lived asset is increased 
the liability is discounted from the year the well is expected to deplete 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated on a unit of production basis over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss which increases or decreases the full cost pool 
this standard requires us to record a liability for the fair value of our dismantlement and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values 
based on our experience and analysis of the oil and gas services industry  we have not factored a market risk premium into our asset retirement obligation 
sfas no 
was adopted by us effective january  see item a

such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  internationally or in the united states  availability of services and supplies  disruption of operations and damages due to hurricanes or tropical storms  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for capital  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
oprice floors at december   we had in place price floors in effect through the march contract month for natural gas 
the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic natural gas production in february and march the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
there are no additional cash outflows for these price floors  as the cash premium was paid at inception of the hedge 
the maximum loss that could be sustained from these price floors in would be their fair value at december  of million 
onew zealand gas contracts all of our gas production in new zealand is sold under long term  fixed price contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
these contracts protect against price volatility  and our revenue from these contracts will vary only due to production fluctuations and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows based on this same level or a modest level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
we had significant foreign net operating loss carryforwards at december  the foreign net operating losses have no expiration period  but would be cancelled if a change in control occurred at either the subsidiary or ultimate parent company level 
other loss carryforwards consist of state net operating losses and capital losses 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating carryovers at december   as management estimates that it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully utilized before they expire 
the foreign net operating loss has no expiration period  but it would be cancelled if a change in control occurred at either the subsidiary or ultimate parent company level 
a valuation allowance has been applied against the capital loss carryforward  as detailed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in estimates caused by changes in oil and gas prices  production levels  capital expenditures  and other variables could impact the company s ability to utilize the carryover amounts 
if we are not able to use our carryforwards  our results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior subordinated notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectively 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior subordinated notes due was million at december for both and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december for both and foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  most notably the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar may impact our financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables  liabilities  natural gas and ngl sales contracts  and new zealand income tax calculations  all denominated in new zealand dollars 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand and because of this  our results of operations  cash flows and effective tax rate are impacted from fluctuations between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
