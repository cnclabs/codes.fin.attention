item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading risk factors beginning on page we do not assume  and specifically disclaim  any obligation to update any forward looking statement contained in this report 
overview the primary source of our operating revenue is freight revenue  which we generate by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive freight revenue from loading and unloading activities  equipment detention and other accessorial services 
our operating revenue also includes revenue from fuel surcharges and non freight revenue  which consists of logistics services provided by mwl  as well as our own logistics division with brokerage services initiated in april and our own intermodal services initiated in october brokerage services involve arranging for another company to transport freight for our customers while we retain the billing  collection and customer management responsibilities 
intermodal services involve the movement of our trailers on railroad flatcars for a portion of a trip 
the main factors that affect our freight revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in the temperature sensitive market and specific customer demand 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through revenue per tractor per week 
we also analyze our rate per total mile  non revenue miles percentage  the miles per tractor we generate  our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue 
in discussing our results of operations  we have included in certain instances a discussion of freight revenue  which excludes fuel surcharge and non freight revenue 
we do this because we believe that freight revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
in  we increased our operating revenue by million  or  including an increase in our freight revenue of million  or  compared with our average freight revenue per tractor per week increased  due to a improvement in average freight revenue per total mile  partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor 
the improvement in asset productivity helped mitigate the continuing challenges of a tight driver market  which limited our fleet growth  and high fuel prices 
we were able to increase our freight revenue by increasing our freight rates  the size of our fleet and our business with existing and new customers 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of lower equipment utilization 
our fuel surcharge revenue in increased by million  or  compared with  primarily due to significantly higher average fuel prices in our non freight revenue in increased by million  or  compared with  due to increased logistics services provided by mwl  as well as our formation of a logistics division with brokerage services in april and intermodal services in october we increased our average operating revenue per tractor per week in our weighted average number of tractors increased in over our profitability on the expense side is impacted by variable costs of transporting freight for our customers  fixed costs and expenses containing both fixed and variable components 
the variable costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency and other factors 
our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and operating terminals 
although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control  we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business 
for example  fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during the past three years 
we manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers  as well as volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals 
the transportation industry has experienced in the last several years substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  and competition for drivers has intensified 
in  we instituted two separate pay increases for our company drivers and increased the incentives paid to independent contractors 
we continue to offer driver compensation that we believe ranks near the top of the industry 
in order to control increases in insurance premiums  we have increased our self insured retention levels periodically during the last several years 
we are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim and up to million in the aggregate for all auto liability claims between million and million 
we are also responsible for the first  on each workers compensation claim 
our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  was in compared with in our net income decreased  or  from our earnings per diluted share decreased to in from in our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
at december   we had approximately million of long term debt  including current maturities  and million in stockholders equity 
in  we spent approximately million  net of proceeds from dispositions  primarily for new revenue equipment  and recognized a gain of million on the disposition of used equipment 
these capital expenditures were primarily funded with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we estimate that capital expenditures  net of proceeds from dispositions  will be approximately million in  primarily for new revenue equipment 
assuming net capital expenditures in that amount and operating margins similar to the margins in  we expect to generate cash flows to retire a substantial amount of our debt in or provide flexibility for other purposes 
based on our current operating performance  the market for used tractors  our liquidity and our expectations concerning tractors manufactured in  we decided to accelerate our tractor fleet replacement during and to allow us greater flexibility in our decisions to purchase tractors in now that the current round of diesel emissions reduction directives of the epa has gone into effect 
this acceleration of our tractor fleet replacement has not impacted the useful lives of our tractors or caused impairment to the carrying amount reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
share based payment arrangement compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
all share based compensation expense is recorded in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
total share based compensation expense recorded in was   net of income tax benefit  which entirely represents additional share based compensation expense recorded as a result of adopting sfas r 
no share based compensation expense was recorded in or  however such expense would have been   net of income tax benefit and   net of income tax benefit  respectively  had we recognized share based expense in net income under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
unrecognized compensation expense from unvested service based stock option awards was million as of december  and is expected to be recorded over a weighted average period of years 
unrecognized compensation expense from unvested performance based stock option awards was  as of december  and will be recorded in the periods in which the performance condition is probable of achievement through stock split on december   we effected a three for two stock split of our common stock  
par value  in the form of a stock dividend 
our consolidated financial statements  related notes  and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented

this increase was partially offset by the impact of lower equipment utilization 
our fuel surcharge revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to significantly higher average fuel prices in more fully discussed below under fuel and fuel taxes 
the increase in non freight revenue in resulted from increased logistics services provided by mwl  as well as our formation of a logistics division with brokerage services in april and intermodal services in october our revenue  before fuel surcharges  increased million  or  in from our average operating revenue per tractor per week increased in from our average freight revenue per tractor per week increased in from  due to a increase in average freight revenue per total mile partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor 
our weighted average number of tractors increased in from our ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers limited our fleet growth in salaries  wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees  including both driver and non driver employees  employees health insurance  k plan contributions and other fringe benefits 
these expenses vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors  our efficiency  our experience with employees health insurance claims  changes in health care premiums and other factors 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits resulted primarily from an increase in the size of our company owned fleet and the miles driven by company drivers  along with an increase in the amount paid to company drivers of cents per mile effective april  additionally  higher self insured medical claims increased our employees health insurance expense by million in these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in compensation expensed for our non driver employees under our incentive compensation program from purchased transportation consists of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment and to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities 
this category will vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors  the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and the amount and rates we pay to third party railroad and motor carriers 
purchased transportation expense increased million  or  in from this expense  excluding fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and brokerage and intermodal payments  decreased million  or  in  primarily due to a decrease in the number of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet 
payments to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our brokerage and intermodal operations were million in and million in the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors decreased  in fuel and fuel taxes  which we refer to as fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in miles driven by our company owned fleet  a higher average fuel price net of surcharges and lower fuel efficiencies associated with newer tractors 
our fuel prices  which remain high based on historical standards  significantly increased to an average of per gallon in from an average of per gallon in we have fuel surcharge provisions in substantially all of our transportation contracts and attempt to recover a portion of these increased expenses through fuel surcharges and higher rates 
we expect our fuel expense to increase in the future because we believe that government mandated emissions standards  which became effective october   have resulted in less fuel efficient engines  and that more restrictive emissions standards that took effect in will result in further declines in engine efficiency 
supplies and maintenance consist of repairs  maintenance  tires  parts  oil and engine fluids  along with load specific expenses including loading unloading  tolls  pallets and trailer hostling 
the increase in supplies and maintenance in primarily resulted from our larger fleet and the higher percentage of company owned tractors in our fleet  for which we bear all maintenance expenses 
our maintenance practices were consistent with depreciation relates to owned tractors  trailers  communications units  terminal facilities and other assets 
gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment are set forth in a separate line item  rather than included in this category 
the increase in depreciation was due to an increase in revenue equipment and in the relative percentage of company owned tractors to independent contractor owned tractors in we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of our accelerated tractor fleet replacement and higher prices of new equipment  which is expected to result in greater depreciation over the useful life 
insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts  primarily for personal injury  property damage  physical damage to our equipment  cargo claims and workers compensation claims 
these expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  our self insured retention levels and the market for insurance 
the increase in insurance and claims in was comprised of a million increase in the cost of self insured accident claims partially offset by a  decrease in insurance premiums 
we are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim and up to million in the aggregate for all auto liability claims between million and million 
we are also responsible for the first  on each workers compensation claim 
our significant self insured retention and our risk on the first million of auto liability claims in the million to million corridor expose us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods depending on the frequency  severity and timing of claims and to adverse financial results if we incur large or numerous losses 
in the event of an uninsured claim above our insurance coverage  or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims within our self insured retention  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in  increases in the market value for used revenue equipment along with additional planned revenue equipment dispositions caused our gain on disposition of revenue equipment to increase to million from million in future gains or losses on disposition of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment  which is beyond our control 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  was in compared with in interest expense primarily consists of interest on our unsecured committed credit facility and senior unsecured notes 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average debt balances outstanding in our effective income tax rate decreased to in compared with in primarily because we decreased our deferred income tax liability by of income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate in included a revision to our previously recorded deferred income tax liability of of income before income taxes  primarily due to a change in our income apportionment for several states  which produced a lower expected effective state income tax rate  net of federal impact

our effective income tax rate was in compared with in this decrease resulted primarily from increasing our deferred income tax liability in by of income before income taxes as a result of an increase in our statutory federal and state income tax rates based upon projected future taxable income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased  to million in from million in net earnings per share increased to per diluted share in from per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations  our unsecured senior notes and our revolving credit facility 
a portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment 
we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties 
however  to the extent we purchase tractors and extend financing to the independent contractors through our tractor purchase program  we have an associated capital expenditure requirement 
the table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash flows used for investing activities and total long term debt  including current maturities  for the years indicated 
in thousands net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used for investing activities long term debt  including current maturities  at december in  we spent approximately million  net of proceeds from dispositions  to purchase new revenue equipment and also recognized a gain of million on the disposition of used equipment 
based on our current operating performance  the market for used tractors  our liquidity and our expectations concerning tractors manufactured in  we decided to accelerate our tractor fleet replacement during and to allow us greater flexibility in our decisions to purchase tractors in  to add capacity to meet growing demand  and to add tractors to our company fleet as more of our drivers become company drivers rather than independent contractors 
this acceleration of our tractor fleet replacement has not impacted the useful lives of our tractors or caused impairment to the carrying amount reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
these capital expenditures were primarily funded with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the outstanding principal balance of our credit facility has increased as a result of the accelerated fleet replacement 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
based upon anticipated cash flows  current borrowing availability and sources of financing we expect to be available to us  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
we estimate that capital expenditures  net of proceeds from dispositions  will be approximately million in  primarily for new revenue equipment 
assuming net capital expenditures in that amount and operating margins similar to the margins in  we expect to generate cash flows to retire a substantial amount of our debt in or provide flexibility for other purposes 
we have outstanding series a senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in october  require annual principal payments of million and bear interest at a fixed rate of 
we also have outstanding series b senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in april  require annual principal payments of million and bear interest at a fixed rate of 
in august  we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five year unsecured committed credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility may be increased at our option up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of million 
the credit agreement amends and restates in its entirety our prior credit agreement 
at december   the credit facility had an outstanding principal balance of million  outstanding standby letters of credit of million and remaining borrowing availability of million 
this facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate or the agent bank s prime rate  in each case plus minus applicable margins 
the weighted average interest rate for the credit facility was at december  our credit facility prohibits us from paying  in any fiscal year  dividends in excess of of our net income from the prior fiscal year 
the debt agreements discussed above also contain restrictive covenants which  among other matters  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt to equity  cash flow leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december  we had million in direct financing receivables from independent contractors under our tractor purchase program as of december   compared with million in receivables as of december  these receivables  which are collateralized by the tractors financed  are used to attract and retain qualified independent contractors 
we deduct payments from the independent contractors settlements weekly and  as a result  have experienced minimal collection issues for these receivables 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands and and thereafter total long term debt obligations purchase obligations for revenue equipment operating lease obligations total related parties we purchase fuel and obtain tires and related services from bauer built  incorporated  or bbi 
jerry m 
bauer  one of our directors  is the president and a stockholder of bbi 
we paid bbi million in  million in and  in for fuel and tire services 
in addition  we paid million in  million in and million in to tire manufacturers for tires that we purchased from the tire manufacturers but were provided by bbi 
bbi received commissions from the tire manufacturers related to these purchases 
other than any benefit received from his ownership interest  mr 
bauer receives no compensation or other benefits from our business with bbi 
during and  we paid durand builders service  inc  and  respectively  for various construction projects 
larry b 
hagness  one of our directors  is the president and owner of durand builders service  inc other than any benefit received from his ownership interest  mr 
hagness receives no compensation or other benefits from these transactions 
mwl  our owned affiliate  is a third party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of our revenue from transportation services arranged by mwl 
off balance sheet arrangements other than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self insurance programs in the amount of million and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations  we did not have any other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  accident claims  health insurance and employee compensation 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability 
we require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature control units on our trailers 
substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we historically have been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  such increases usually are not fully recovered 
fuel prices were high throughout the past three years  which has increased our cost of operating 
seasonality our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims and more equipment repairs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including fuel surcharges  at the time shipment of freight is completed 
accounts receivable 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances  including any billing disputes 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we evaluate the allowance based on historical write off experience  the size of the individual customer balances  past due amounts and the overall national economy 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
property and equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments 
our net property and equipment was million as of december  and million as of december  our depreciation expense was million for  million for and million for we compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset  reduced by its estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over its estimated useful life 
we determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment  prior useful lives and changes in technology 
we have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years 
we believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of december  by approximately million  or 
in  we replaced most of our company owned tractors within approximately years and our trailers within approximately seven years after purchase 
our useful lives for depreciating tractors is five years and trailers is seven years  with a salvage value for tractors and a salvage value for trailers 
these salvage values are based upon the expected market values of the equipment after five years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner approximates the continuing declining value of the revenue equipment  and  for tractors  continues at a consistent straight line rate for units held beyond the normal replacement cycle 
calculating tractor depreciation expense with a five year useful life and a salvage value results in the same depreciation rate of of cost per year and the same net book value of of cost at the year replacement date as using a year useful life and salvage value 
as a result  there is no difference in recorded depreciation expense on a quarterly or annual basis with our five year useful life and salvage value compared with a year useful life and salvage value 
impairment of assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
insurance and claims 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
however  we could suffer a series of losses within our self insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim and up to million in the aggregate for all auto liability claims between million and million 
we are also responsible for the first  on each workers compensation claim 
we have million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities 
the insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december   and million as of december  we reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
we periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development factors 
we believe that our claims development factors have historically been reasonable  as indicated by the adequacy of our insurance and claims accruals compared to settled claims 
actual results could differ from these current estimates 
in addition  to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled  jury awards are difficult to predict 
if our claims settlement experience worsened causing our historical claims development factors to increase by  our estimated outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million 
share based payment arrangement compensation 
we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment arrangements granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we record share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for service based awards normally the vesting period 
compensation expense will be recorded for performance based awards in the periods in which the performance condition is probable of achievement 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payment arrangements under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly  did not reflect compensation expense in net income as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment arrangements require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment arrangements and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
we believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility 
thus  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent it is determined that it is not likely that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
however  if the facts or our financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of any valuation allowance required in any given period 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of and it is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no

sab requires registrants to apply the new guidance for the first time that it identifies material errors in existence at the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november  by correcting those errors through a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
the adoption of sab in had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of high fuel prices 
fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers  though they can vary somewhat from customer to customer 
we believe fuel surcharges are effective at mitigating the risk of high fuel prices  although we do not recover the full amount of fuel price increases 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
we have historically maintained a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
our fixed rate obligations consist of amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior notes 
the million outstanding at december   under our series a senior notes  bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
the million outstanding at december   under our series b senior notes  bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
based on such outstanding amounts  a one percentage point decline in market interest rates would have the effect of increasing the premium we pay over market interest rates by approximately  annually 
our variable rate obligations consist of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate or the agent bank s prime rate  in each case plus minus applicable margins 
the weighted average interest rate for the facility was at december  as of december   we had borrowed million under the credit facility 
based on such outstanding amount  a one percentage point increase in market interest rates would cost us  in additional gross interest cost on an annual basis
