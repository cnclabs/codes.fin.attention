item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies  significant judgments  and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return that we account for as a warranty provision under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and eitf standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
revenue generated from development contracts are recorded on a cost plus basis in the period services are rendered 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from our customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products  and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements  and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and loss accruals may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions  and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payment as amended using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred and specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
a one percent change in actual costs would have an impact of approximately  on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes to the valuation allowance  changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses  and a current expectation that  it s more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
a one percent change in actual claims would have an impact of approximately  on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview zygo corporation is a worldwide supplier of optical metrology instruments  precision optics  and electro optical design and manufacturing services  serving customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and industrial markets 
optical instruments products encompass non contact optical measurement instruments 
optics products consist of high performance macro optics components  optical coatings  and optical system assemblies 
we conduct the majority of our manufacturing in our  square foot facility in middlefield  connecticut and a  square foot leased facility in tucson  arizona 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reorganized the business into two operating divisions metrology solutions metrology segment and optical systems optics segment 
consistent with our new business structure  beginning with our second quarter in fiscal we reported our segments as metrology and optics 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  our segments were reported as semiconductor and industrial 
the metrology segment consists of oem and in line products primarily for the semiconductor and industrial markets 
the optics segment consists of components and opto mechanical assemblies primarily for the medical  defense  and aerospace industries  which are included in the industrial market 
we believe that within the metrology segment  the semiconductor market contains our best sales growth opportunities in the future 
as such  we are focusing our research and development efforts on specific semiconductor initiatives  most notably in the display and packaging markets 
during the past year  we continued to expand our office in oregon which houses our semiconductor process metrology group to take advantage of opportunities in the semiconductor markets 
in addition  during fiscal  we built on the success of our front end semiconductor metrology tool  the zd by introducing the zd and the unifire to our in fab semiconductor product portfolio 
within our optics segment  areas of growth continue to be in laser fusion optics and medical based products 
in june  our tucson  arizona  operation received iso certification for medical product manufacturing 
this certification reinforces our ongoing commitment to pursue manufacturing opportunities in the medical components market 
the facility s quality system is also certified to iso over the past four years  development services for canon inc have produced a significant amount of our revenue 
however  our development services contract with canon inc were completed during the third quarter of fiscal for fiscal  increases in overall sales and new product sales growth  both overall and within our metrology segment  offset the year over year decrease in the development services revenue 
overall  sales to canon inc and canon sales co  inc 
collectively  canon  our single largest customer  represented of our total net sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this represented a decrease of million in sales in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with the million decrease in development services revenue being partially offset by increases in oem purchases 
our backlog at june  was million  a decrease of million from june  orders were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal orders from the company s metrology segment accounted for of the orders received  with the optics segment accounting for the remaining 
for fiscal  orders were million  a decrease of over fiscal as we have previously disclosed  orders for our lithography oem products have experienced a sharp decline and we anticipate that this will continue through the remainder of calendar we have also seen push outs and cancellations in the semiconductor capital equipment sector 
we further anticipate fiscal sales and earnings to be skewed toward the second half of the year when we believe we will see an increase in orders and shipments of semiconductor and display systems 
in august  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the repurchases will occur from time to time as market conditions warrant through transactions in the open market 
the initial share repurchases are expected to be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with rule b under the securities exchange act of this rule allows public companies to adopt written  pre arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material  non public information in their possession 
the adoption of this stock trading plan allows us to repurchase our shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year

net sales in the optics segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increase in net sales of million within the optics segment was primarily due to an increased volume of optical system assemblies of million and contract manufacturing of  which includes medical component sales 
approximately of all fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross profit twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total gross profit in the metrology segment as a percentage of net sales increased by two percentage points in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the decrease in development services revenues  which comprised of metrology revenue in fiscal and only in fiscal and which has historically carried margins of 
gross profit in the optics segment as a percentage of sales increased by ten percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to having a steady order flow within our contract manufacturing operation which increased our efficiency and productivity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal included increases in sales and marketing of million primarily due to increases in marketing activities of million for our semiconductor products and million for our optical systems solutions 
we also incurred additional costs of million as we increased our presence throughout our foreign operations 
administration expenses decreased slightly by million 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the increase in rd e costs in fiscal was primarily related to increased spending on our semiconductor initiatives of million  display solutions of million  instrument projects of million  and contract manufacturing projects of million

net earnings per diluted share were for fiscal  as compared with per diluted share for fiscal fiscal net earnings included a benefit for the effect of the eie credit related to fiscal and of million 
the increased earnings were primarily the result of increased net sales and increased gross profits as a percentage of sales which was partially offset by a million increase in rd e to support our new initiatives 
backlog backlog at june  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million at june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
the decrease in backlog primarily reflects a sharp decline in our lithography oem products and we anticipate that this trend will continue through the remainder of calendar we have also experienced push outs and cancellations related to fiscal activity in the semiconductor capital equipment sector 
we further anticipate fiscal sales and earnings to be skewed toward the second half of the year when we believe we will see a strengthening in orders and shipments of semiconductor and display systems 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increase in net sales of million within the metrology segment was primarily due to an increase of product sales for the instruments and inline semiconductor tools of million  net sales to our lithography customers of million  and development services of million 
we opened offices in china and korea in fiscal and and have seen a steady increase in sales activity from those markets 
net sales in the optics segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increase in net sales of million within the optics segment was primarily due to an increased volume of contract manufacturing of million  offset in part by a decrease in laser fusion optics of million in fiscal as compared with the prior period 
approximately of all fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross profit twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total gross profit in the metrology segment as a percentage of net sales increased by a percentage point in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our concentrated effort to utilize new low cost  high quality vendors 
margins on development services remained flat year over year at 
gross profit in the optics segment as a percentage of sales increased by two percentage points in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increased profit as a percentage of net sales was also primarily due to utilizing new low cost  high quality vendors 
in fiscal  share based compensation expenses decreased overall gross profit by million 
restated with new segment information 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal included increases in sales and marketing of million primarily due to increases in technical support and service personnel and increases in marketing activities in japan and korea  and in optical systems worldwide 
in addition  employee benefits cost increased million and outside services increased million related to computer infrastructure costs 
in fiscal  share based compensation expenses related to sg a were million 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e twelve months ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales rd e costs in fiscal were primarily driven by semiconductor initiatives of million  metrology projects of million  and costs associated with the newly opened oregon office of million 
in fiscal  share based compensation expense related to rd e was million 
income tax expense twelve months ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate income tax expense in fiscal increased by as compared with the prior year 
the overall tax rate  however  decreased by eight percentage points when compared with the prior year primarily due to the redetermination of our fiscal and extraterritorial income exclusion eie 
due to this redetermination  the company recorded an aggregate tax benefit of million in the current fiscal year  related to fiscal and net earnings twelve months ended dollars in millions june  sales june  sales net earnings in fiscal increased by as compared with the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share were for fiscal  as compared with per diluted share for fiscal the increased earnings were primarily the result of increased net sales  increased gross profits as a percentage of sales due in part to the effects of our cost control initiatives and the effect of the eie credit related to fiscal and the net earnings for fiscal included losses of million  net of tax  related to the operations of our discontinued teraoptix unit and charges of million  net of tax  related to the disposal of our discontinued teraoptix unit 
the charge related to the disposal of our discontinued teraoptix unit was primarily due to the sale of our vacant facility in westborough  massachusetts in the third quarter of fiscal the earnings from continuing operations for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  as compared with earnings from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal backlog backlog at june  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million at june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of million  or  in the semiconductor segment and million  or  in the industrial segment 
orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the semiconductor segment and million  or  in the industrial segment 
the increase in the backlog is reflective of strength across all segments especially lithography related orders 
transactions with stockholder sales to canon  a stockholder  customer  and distributor of certain of our products in japan amounted to million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales for the years ended june    and  respectively 
selling prices of products sold to canon are based  generally  on the normal terms customarily given to distributors 
revenues generated from a development contract with canon are recorded on a cost plus basis 
at june  and  there was in the aggregate  million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
in september  we entered into a contract with canon related to the development of certain interferometers 
in march  we signed a preliminary agreement to begin further add on work  the definitive agreement for this additional work was signed in december in february  we entered into two additional agreements with canon related to the development of prototype production tools and accessories 
during the twelve months ended june   we recognized revenue of million under the canon development services contract compared with million for the comparable prior period 
our development services contract with canon inc was completed during the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and marketable securities was million  an increase of million from million at june  the increase in cash was primarily attributable to cash generated from our operating activities  partially offset by an increase in inventory and capital expenditures and a significant decrease in progress payments 
this increase in inventory was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory for semiconductor systems and to a lesser extent  for certain other product lines 
cash flows from operating activities were million for fiscal as compared with million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to progress payments received in fiscal related to our development services agreements  flat panel systems  and optics contracts 
in fiscal  we utilized the progress payments in excess of new progress payments for flat panel systems and the end of the development services agreement 
acquisitions of property  plant  and equipment were million in fiscal as compared with million for fiscal the increase was due primarily to the additional equipment for the manufacture and demonstration of the new semiconductor products  test equipment for increased efficiency  and tooling for the manufacture of new products 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our million bank line of credit agreement at june  and the agreement contains certain financial covenants which  among others  relate to debt service and consolidated debt ratios in august  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
we expect the repurchase of the stock to be paid by the combination of current earnings and current cash and cash equivalent balances 
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of various factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period dollars in millions less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt  or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including institutional money market funds which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities  government agency securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
the table below presents investment amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in dollars in millions thereafter marketable securities fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate on june   the company had variable interest rate money market accounts valued at million 
marketable securities fair market value sensitivity at june   our investment portfolio included certain investments  aggregating million  in entities believed to have risk exposure in sub prime markets 
we have reviewed  along with our investment advisor  current investment ratings  company specific events  and general economic conditions in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
to the extent we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
in addition  if the investment grades of the securities decline  liquidity in the market may be restricted or the market value of the security may decline 
there is the potential that  if credit limits tighten significantly  the issuer may not have access to the capital markets to pay off the securities at the time of maturity 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included orders in us dollars of million  or of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to six months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the euro and japanese yen 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
