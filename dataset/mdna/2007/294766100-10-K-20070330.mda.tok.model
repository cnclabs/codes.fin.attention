realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
on an ongoing basis  the fund carries its investments in its financial statements at fair value  as determined by the fund s board of directors 
see significant accounting policies valuation below 
as of december   the fund had invested approximately of its net assets in securities of portfolio companies that constituted qualifying investments under the act 
at that time  the fund had invested approximately by value in shares of common stock  in membership interests in limited liability companies  in preferred stock and in various debt instruments 
also as of december   the fund had invested the proceeds of borrowings on margin as discussed below under financing activities in short term  highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of us treasury bills  interest bearing bank accounts and certificates of deposit  that are  in the opinion of the adviser  appropriate for the preservation of the principal amount of such instruments 
the fund maintained substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents since may under certain circumstances  the fund is called upon to make follow on investments in some of its portfolio companies 
if the fund does not have sufficient funds or elects not to make a follow on investment when called upon  this may adversely affect the portfolio company and result in a reduction in the fund s equity interest in  and the estimated fair value of  such portfolio company

the fund committed to approximately million in one or more debt securities to be issued by rp c international investments llc  approximately million in healthspac  llc and million in kopelson entertainment company  through the fund s wholly owned subsidiary equus media development company  llc emdc 
see portfolio companies rp c international investments llc and portfolio companies healthspac llc below 
financing activities 
from time to time  the fund uses leverage to finance a portion of its investments 
the fund then repays such debt from the sale of portfolio securities 
under the act  the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue debt securities or preferred stock  which are referred to as senior securities  subject to certain restrictions including an overall limitation on the amount of outstanding debt  or leverage  relative to equity of because of the nature and size of the fund s portfolio investments  it periodically borrow funds to make qualifying investments in order to maintain its qualification as a ric 
during and  the fund borrowed such funds by accessing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
the fund invests the proceeds of these margin loans in high quality securities such us treasury securities until they are repaid 
the fund refers to these high quality investments as restricted assets because they are not generally available for investment in portfolio companies under the terms of borrowing 
if  in the future  the fund cannot borrow funds to make such qualifying investments at the end of any future quarter  it may not qualify as a ric and would become subject to corporate level income tax on its net investment income and realized capital gains  if any 
in addition  the fund s distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary dividends to the extent paid from earnings and profits 
see federal income tax considerations 
to the extent that any of its loans are denominated in a currency other than us dollars  the fund may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the fund may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements from time to time 
such hedging activities  which are subject to compliance with applicable law  may include the use of futures  options and forward contracts 
costs incurred in entering into such hedging contracts or in settling them are borne by the fund 
distributions 
the fund intends to distribute to stockholders quarterly all net taxable investment income and net taxable realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make new or follow on investments 
for a discussion of the current distribution  see price range of common stock and distributions distributions 
the fund reserves the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to the fund as long term capital gains  and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their applicable tax credit 
at the time of the fund s distributions  if any  it expects to offer stockholders the option of receiving their payment in the form of cash or stock  which has been its practice in prior years 

table of contents as a closed end business development company  the fund s shares of common stock are not redeemable at the option of stockholders  and its shares currently trade at a discount to their net asset value 
the fund s board of directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of its stockholders to reduce or eliminate this market value discount 
accordingly  the fund has been authorized to  and may from time to time  repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock including by means of tender offers in an effort to reduce or eliminate this market discount or to increase the net asset value of the fund s shares 
the fund is not required to undertake any such share repurchases 
significant accounting policies valuation of investments the valuation of portfolio companies is the most significant area of judgment impacting the fund s financial statements 
the fund carries portfolio investments on its financial statements at fair value  with any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
the fund performs valuations of portfolio securities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  and the financial reporting policies of the sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities 
the fund values investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded at their quoted market prices at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities  which the fund refers to as the valuation discount  if applicable 
as of december   the fund had no investments in publicly traded securities 
privately held portfolio securities 
the fund determines the fair value of investments for which no market exists on the basis of procedures established in good faith by its board of directors and based on input from the investment adviser and the fund s audit committee 
as a general principle  the fair value of an investment is the amount that the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective  and the estimated values arrived at by the fund s board of directors may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of specific portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor the fund uses to determine fair value until significant developments affecting a portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  the fund carries portfolio investments at appraised values as determined quarterly by the adviser  subject to the approval of the fund s board of directors 
the fund typically bases its valuations upon a multiple of each portfolio company s income and or cash flow  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  this appraisal may be based upon estimated liquidation value 
the fund typically appraises its common equity investment in each portfolio company at a multiple of the free cash flow generated by such company in its most recent fiscal year  less adjustments for outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
in some cases  the fund considers projections of current year free cash flow in its appraisals  and it may also consider an adjustment to the estimate of free cash flow for non recurring items 
the fund applies multiples based on the adviser s experience and recent transactions in the private company marketplace and cautions that these assessments are necessarily subjective in nature 
from time to time  the fund may elect to use third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis for its valuation of such company  although this is not the fund s typical approach to valuation 
this method of valuation is referred to as the private market method 
when an external event  such as a purchase transaction  public rights offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the fund applies the pricing indicated by such external event to corroborate its private equity valuation 
the fund generally uses the private market method only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
most of the fund s portfolio companies use leverage  which has the effect of magnifying its return or loss on investments 
for example  if a portfolio company has a total enterprise value of million and has million in funded indebtedness  the fund values its equity at million 
if the enterprise value of that portfolio company then increases or decreases by  to million or million  respectively  the value of the equity will increase or decrease by  to million or  as the case may be 
this disproportionate increase or decrease in equity value relative to total asset value adds a level of volatility to the fund s equity oriented portfolio securities 

table of contents from time to time  some of the fund s portfolio companies default in respect of covenants in their loan agreements 
when the fund has a reasonable belief that a portfolio company will be able to restructure its loan agreement to waive or eliminate such default or defaults  the fund continues to value its portfolio company s securities as a going concern 
if a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its debt or is not successful in refinancing its debt at maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on such portfolio company s assets or through reorganization or bankruptcy 
under such circumstances  the fund adjusts the value of its investment in the portfolio company accordingly 
the fund generally holds investments in debt securities to maturity 
accordingly  the fund determines the fair value of debt securities on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial condition of the issuer 
the fund values certificates of deposit at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
on a daily basis  the fund adjusts net asset value for changes in the value of publicly held securities  if any  and for material changes in the value of investments in securities issued by private companies 
the fund reports these amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly  and its daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes the fund intends to comply with the requirements of the code necessary for us to qualify as a ric 
so long as it complies with these requirements  the fund generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains distributed to stockholders 
therefore  the fund did not record a provision for federal income taxes in its financial statements 
as of december   the fund had no capital loss carry forward as it was fully utilized in the fund may borrow money from time to time to maintain its status as a ric under the code 
see overview financing activities above 
interest income recognition the fund records interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis to the extent that it expects to collect such amounts 
the fund stops accruing interest on investments when it determines that interest is no longer collectible 
if the fund receives any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible  it treats such cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid  before it recognizes any additional interest income 
the fund accretes or amortizes discounts and premiums on securities purchased over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discount and or amortization of premium on debt securities 
payment in kind interest the fund has loans in its portfolio that may pay pik interest 
the fund adds pik interest  if any  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain its status as a ric  the fund must pay out to stockholders this non cash source of income in the form of dividends even if it has not yet collected any cash in respect of such investments 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issues for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
the fund believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements

sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the fund adopted sab on december   and there was no impact on its consolidated financial statements
