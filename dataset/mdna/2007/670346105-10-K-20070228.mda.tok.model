item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information required by this item is incorporated by reference to nucor s annual report  page forward looking statements and pages through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks 
we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 
interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
at december   of nucor s long term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually 
the remaining of nucor s debt is at fixed rates 
future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings 
nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   there were no such contracts outstanding 
nucor s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities 
as a result  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 
commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business  nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy  principally scrap steel and natural gas 
we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand 
in the first quarter of  nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials 
our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins 
nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes million in unrealized net of tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of and in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by million and million  respectively 
any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
because these instruments are structured and used as hedges  these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle
