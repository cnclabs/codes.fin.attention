item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
please see the company s cautionary statements as to forward looking statements for further description of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
adverse changes in economic growth and vitality in the company s banking markets may negatively impact the company 
the company s business is closely tied to the economies of idaho and oregon in general and is particularly affected by the economies of central  southern and northwest oregon  as well as the greater boise  idaho area 
a sustained economic downturn could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has a concentration in real estate lending 
a sustained downturn in real estate within the company s markets could negatively impact the company 
many of the company s loans are secured by real estate located in oregon and idaho 
if these locales experience an economic downturn that adversely affects real estate values and customers ability to repay  loan losses may exceed the estimates that are currently included in the reserve for loan losses  which could adversely affect financial results and shareholder value 
the company s reserve for loan losses and unfunded commitments may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses 
the risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities  and nonpayment  if it occurs  may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
the company maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb estimated probable loan losses inherent in the loan and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the reserve  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan portfolio 
if the company s assumptions are incorrect  the reserve for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the inability to attract or retain key banking employees could adversely affect revenues and net income 
the company strives to attract and retain key banking professionals  management and staff to achieve its growth goals 
banking related revenues and net income could be adversely affected in the event of a loss of key personnel 
changes in interest rates could adversely impact the company 
the company s earnings are highly dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
in addition  changes to the market interest rates may impact the level of loans  deposits and investments  and the credit quality of existing loans 
these rates may be affected by many factors beyond the company s control  including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in interest rates may negatively impact the company s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive regulation 
the company s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state banking authorities which impose requirements and restrictions on the company s operations 
the impact of changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for the company and could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
competition may adversely affect the company 
the company faces competition for its services from a variety of competitors 
the company s future growth and success depends on its ability to compete effectively 
the company competes for deposits  loans and other financial services with numerous financial service providers including banks  thrifts  credit unions  mortgage companies  broker dealers  and insurance companies 
competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

most of the information is required by guide  statistical disclosure by bank holding companies  published by the sec 
at the beginning of each table  information is presented as to the nature of data disclosed in the table 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows reserve for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in relatively complex calculations and analysis 
the company s reserve for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment 
the reserve may be affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in the company s annual report on form k 
mortgage servicing rights msrs determination of the fair value of msrs requires the estimation of multiple interdependent variables  the most impactful of which is mortgage prepayment speeds 
prepayment speeds are estimates of the pace and magnitude of future mortgage payoff or refinance behavior of customers whose loans are serviced by the company 
errors in estimation of prepayment speeds or other key servicing variables could subject msrs to impairment risk 
on a quarterly basis  the company engages a qualified third party to provide an estimate of the fair value of msrs using a discounted cash flow model with assumptions and estimates based upon observable market based data and methodology common to the mortgage servicing market 
management believes it applies reasonable assumptions under the circumstances  however  because of possible volatility in the market price of msrs  and the vagaries of any relatively illiquid market  there can be no assurance that risk management and existing accounting practices will result in the avoidance of possible impairment charges in future periods

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as outlined in guidance from the sec  the objective of the following discussion is to help investors and other interested parties to see the company through the eyes of management  to assist in providing context within which financial information can be better analyzed  and to provide information as to the quality and variability of the company s earnings and cash flows such that the investor can more easily ascertain the likelihood whether past performance is indicative of future performance 
this discussion highlights key information as determined by management but may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding  the following should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
highlights and summary of performance overview business strategy management and directors of cascade have developed and implemented long term goals and strategies with the objective of achieving sustainable double digit eps growth for its shareholders while progressively serving the banking and financial needs of its customers and communities 
the company s business strategy includes operate in and expand into growth markets  strive to recruit and retain the best relationship bankers in such markets  consistently deliver the highest levels of customer service  and  apply state of the art technology for the convenience of customers 
the company s original market was central oregon  whose population has grown in the th percentile of the nation due largely to in migration of those seeking the quality of life offered by the region 
the region has natural high desert beauty  bountiful recreational and cultural choices  good weather  and premier healthcare services 
the company and bank have grown with the community during the last years  to a point of holding a deposit share of this fast growing market 
the combination of a fast growing economy and powerful market share contributed to sustained high performance over the past decade 
in recent years  management has sought to augment its banking footprint by expanding into other attractive oregon markets  including northwest and southwest oregon 
banking locations in these two markets were opened in mid  and during attained breakeven after less than one year of operation 
at december   loans and deposits in these markets total a combined and  respectively of total company balances 
in april of cascade acquired f m 
headquartered in boise  idaho  f m held the top community bank deposit market share of in ada county at that time 
at december   f m held loans and deposits of approximately and  respectively of total company balances 
this expansion furthered the diversification of company banking business into multiple states and markets 
the following table reflects the strong and sustained growth and returns the company has achieved compound annual growth year year year earnings per share growth net income growth loan growth deposit growth key performance indicators the company has established the following performance goals consistently exceed growth in eps  consistently exceed return on equity  identify and prudently manage credit and business risk  strive to profitably diversify revenue sources and markets  and  deliver advanced technology for the benefit of its customers 
in order to achieve these goals  the company has established key measures that specify annual and multi year growth targets for loans and deposits  set benchmarks for its credit quality and the net interest margin 
in addition  non financial measurements are set with respect to sales and customer relationship and retention goals to assist management in directing and monitoring results 
highlights financial performance the following results include the effect of acquisition of f m on april  earnings per share up at with net income up at million loan growth up year over year deposit growth up year over year net interest margin vs 
year over year solid credit quality with delinquent loans at 
of total loans  net charge offs at 
the company reported full year diluted earnings per share eps at per share up as compared to with net income at million versus million for  largely due to cascade s acquisition of f m on april  for the fourth quarter of eps was  up from the year ago quarter and as compared to for the prior quarter which included an approximated 
eps gain on sale of investment securities 
while cascade s fourth quarter loan and deposit growth has typically slowed as the summer construction and tourism season abates  it appears a slowing in the level of real estate activity contributed to this pattern  leading to relatively flat loan and deposit balances  as well as compression of the net interest margin when compared to the prior quarter see discussion below 
return on equity was for the fourth quarter of and for the full year return on assets continued well above peer banks at for the final quarter of and for the full year loan growth and credit quality at december   the bank s loan portfolio had grown to billion  up compared to a year ago 
this increase was due to a combination of organic growth in the company s oregon market year over year augmented by the addition of f m loan volumes 
since the close of the acquisition in april  the idaho loan portfolio has expanded at a annualized pace 
however  with a seasonal slowing in the pace of construction and real estate activity during the fourth quarter  combined loan volumes grew at a annualized pace when compared to the immediately preceding quarter 
management believes the national and regional softening in the pace of real estate activity may have amplified the expected seasonal slowing in loan growth in the fourth quarter 
credit quality metrics remains very strong at the bank and better than peer bank levels 
delinquencies and non performing assets have increased from historically low levels in part due to softening real estate markets 
non performing assets were million at year end  up from million at september  delinquent loans greater than days past due were at 
of total loans compared to 
at september   with the increase centered in a single credit 
meanwhile  fourth quarter net loan charge offs were 
annualized of total loans as compared to 
and 
for the prior quarter and prior year ends  respectively 
the bank s provision for loan losses and commitments was million for the fourth quarter  bringing the full year provision to million 
the reserve for loan and commitment losses totaled of loans at year end  compared to a year earlier and at the prior quarter end 
of this aggregate amount  the portion classified as a reserve for loan commitments is approximately 
of gross loans 
this amount is included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management believes these reserves are at an appropriate level based upon its evaluation and analysis of portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions 
deposit growth at december   deposits were billion  up from prior year end 
much of this increase arose from the acquisition of f m in april 
on a linked quarter basis  total deposits were up annualized  but excluding increased brokered deposit balances  customer deposits were below that of prior quarter end 
this decline in part reflects the end of the peak summer and fall tourism and construction season wherein deposit growth flattens through the winter quarter 
however  management believes the nationwide slowing in the velocity of real estate activity contributed to the fourth quarter s deposit weakness 
at year end  cascade s customers who businesses are engaged in various aspects of real estate such as construction  mortgage  escrow and realty show a reduction in average and end of period deposit balances as compared to the prior quarter 
this is particularly evident in overall balances of non interest bearing deposits which fell between september  and december   with central oregon  southern oregon and idaho regions showing declines 
underscoring this development  such balances fell from of total deposits during the third quarter of to for the fourth quarter  yet customer account retention and acquisition has been solid during this period 
idaho f m region fourth quarter average deposits were essentially flat as compared to q  and appear to have stabilized after some runoff in higher priced deposits related to the acquisition 
the f m banking team is well positioned to expand market share with the introduction of cash management and business depository strategies into the idaho market over the coming year 
over the past several years  cascade has made it a top priority to expand and strengthen its team of professional banking specialists who focus on delivering premier business depository services to a targeted customer base 
as of year end  f m deposit balances fell by approximately million as compared to september  this change was the result of repositioning several large customers into non deposit investment alternatives offered by cascade 
non interest income and expense non interest income for was million  above the prior year  including service fee income which was at million  up from the prior year largely owing to the f m combination 
for the full year  residential mortgage originations totaled million  up when compared to million in related net mortgage revenue was million  an increase of compared to million for the previous year 
however  fourth quarter net mortgage revenue of 
million was slightly less than third quarter of 
million as a result of the slowing velocity of real estate transactions 
non interest expense for the year increased compared to and th quarter expenses were above the year ago quarter as a result of the acquisition of f m 
when compared to the immediately preceding quarter  non interest expense expanded at a annualized pace with the addition of staff positions to support cascade s infrastructure and ongoing growth goals 
results of operations years ended december    and net interest income net interest margin with the acquisition of f m and ongoing loan growth in its oregon markets  net interest income increased in or million as compared to higher market interest rates contributed to this increase  as yields increased on a larger base of earning assets  exceeding the higher cost of funds on incremental liability balances 
similarly  net interest income increased in as compared to yields earned on assets increased to for  as compared to in and in meanwhile  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for increased to in from in and in primarily because of higher loan volumes and yields  total interest income increased approximately million or for increased volumes of interest bearing deposits and borrowings in conjunction with higher interest rates paid caused total interest expense to increase approximately million or for as compared to the prior year 
the company s net interest margin nim increased to for  as compared to for however  the company reported an easing in the nim to for the fourth quarter of  compared to for the preceding quarter and for the year ago quarter 
the recent easing in the nim was primarily a function of higher overall cost of funds as consequence of the decline in average non interest bearing deposits discussed above 
because of lower non interest bearing deposit volumes  the company increased its usage of wholesale funding sources at higher market rates of interest for the quarter 
the average cost of funds paid on interest bearing liabilities for the fourth quarter of was as compared to in the preceding quarter and a year ago 
yields on earning assets during the fourth quarter of were modestly higher at compared to in the immediately preceding quarter and in the year ago quarter 
looking forward  management expects the net interest margin may continue to ease as a result of ongoing competitive pricing pressures and persistent flat yield curve that can affect both rate and mix of funding sources 
the margin can also be affected by factors beyond market interest rates  including loan or deposit volume shifts and or aggressive rate offerings by competitor institutions 
the company s financial model indicates a relatively stable interest rate risk profile within a reasonable range of rate movements around the forward rates currently predicted by financial markets 
because of its relatively high proportion of non interest bearing funds  the company s nim is most adversely affected in the unlikely event federal funds rate falls to a very low level 
see item a below

analysis of changes in interest income and expense for most financial institutions  including the company  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned  principally from loans and investment securities portfolio  and interest paid  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income results from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table shows the dollar amount of the increase decrease in the company s consolidated interest income and expense  and attributes such variance to volume or rate changes 
variances that were immaterial have been allocated equally between rate and volume categories dollars in thousands year ended december  over over amount of change amount of change total attributed to total attributed to increase increase decrease volume rate decrease volume rate interest income interest and fees on loans    taxable securities    non taxable securities interest bearing balances due from fhlb federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold total interest income     interest expense interest on deposits interest bearing demand      savings time    other borrowings      total interest expense    net interest income     non interest income total non interest income in was up at million as compared to  while increased a modest over the increase was due to the acquisition of f m  which brought increased volume of banking accounts and related fee based transaction activity in deposit account services and overdraft transactions 
income related to residential mortgage origination activity was higher also due to f m volumes  however slowing real estate activity in both idaho and oregon moderated gains in this area see next section 
home mortgage originations and mortgage related revenue including volumes generated at f m  residential mortgage originations totaled million in  up compared to million in volumes increased as compared to million originated in non interest income arising from mortgage services totaled approximately million in compared to million in and million in the general level and direction of interest rates directly influence the volume and profitability of mortgage banking 
rates stabilized in  compared to a modest increase in the company sells a significant portion of its residential mortgage loans to fannie mae  a us government sponsored enterprise and other secondary market investors 
the company services such loans for fannie mae and is paid approximately 
per annum on the outstanding balances for providing this service 
such revenues are included in the above mortgage banking results 
mortgages serviced for fannie mae totaled million at december  and million at december   upon which were recorded related mortgage servicing rights msrs of approximately million in and million in the company capitalizes the estimated market value of msrs into income upon the sale of each originated mortgage loan 
the company amortizes msrs in proportion to the servicing income it receives from fannie mae over the estimated life of the underlying mortgages  considering prepayment expectations and refinancing patterns 
in addition  the company amortizes  in full  any remaining msrs balance that is specifically associated with a serviced loan that is refinanced or paid off 
the carrying value of the msrs as compared to estimated market value was 
at december  as compared to 
a year ago 
mortgage loans not sold to fnma  are generally sold servicing released to other secondary market investors 
loan sold on this basis generate no future servicing fees for the company 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses for were million  an increase of compared to while expenses were above levels 
the expense growth primarily resulted from the acquisition of f m 
increases in expenses was primarily for human resources  including staffing increases to meet growing business volumes and support for new markets 
in addition  both and included increases in incentive based bonuses tied to the profitability of the company 
with the economies of scale realized in cascades acquisition of f m  the company s efficiency ratio improved to in compared to in  notably better than peer banks for the period 
going forward management expects non interest expense to gradually increase as it adds staff appropriate to support cascade s infrastructure and ongoing growth goals 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased during the periods presented primarily as a result of higher pre tax income 
in  the company s provision for income taxes was reduced due to the impact of a state of oregon corporate income tax credit of approximately 
million 
the company s effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to nontaxable income generated from investments in bank owned life insurance  tax exempt municipal bonds  business energy tax credits and low income housing credits 
financial condition with the acquisition of f m and strong organic growth  total assets increased to billion at december   compared to billion at december  loans grew million or to billion at year end growth in total assets was primarily funded by a deposit increase of million or above the prior year end  mainly owing to the f m acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  cascade implemented its relationship banking strategy in idaho  allowing certain rate sensitive deposits in idaho to run off  resulting in a decline in deposits at f m between april and december of of approximately million 
this decline includes balances of several large customers that were repositioned into non deposit off balance sheet investment alternatives offered by cascade 
to offset this decline and fund its strong asset growth  cascade subsequently utilized brokered and cdars deposits 
at december   such brokered deposits totaled million and cdars deposits totaled approximately million 
cdars certificate of deposit registry program deposits are utilized to meet the needs of certain customers whose investment policies may necessitate or require fdic insurance see deposits and liquidity sections of this report 
the balance of asset growth was funded by an increase in borrowings of approximately million  as well as an increase in trust preferred securities of million 
the company had no significant derivative financial instruments as of december  and the following sections provide detailed analysis of the company s financial condition  describing its loan portfolio composition and credit risk management practices including those related to the loan loss reserve  as well as investment portfolio  deposits  and capital position 
loan portfolio composition net loans represent of total assets as of december  the company makes substantially all of its loans to customers located within the company s service areas 
due to the economic conditions and characteristics of the company s primary markets  cascade has historically had loan concentrations in real estate development  construction and commercial real estate loans 
this is due to the rapid growth in population and the nature of the tourism and service industry found in much of cascade s market areas 
the loan portfolio composition of f m was similar to that of cascade 
while the company has worked to increase the diversification of its loan portfolio by geography and loan type  it is expected that real estate lending will continue to be a major concentration within the loan portfolio 
the company has no significant agricultural loans 
the following table presents the composition of the company s loan portfolio  at the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  commercial    real estate construction lot      mortgage      commercial      consumer      total loans      less reserve for loan losses      total loans  net     at december   the contractual maturities of all loans by category were as follows dollars in thousands due after one  but due within within due after loan category one year five years five years total commercial     real estate construction lot    mortgage     commercial     consumer     at december   variable and adjustable rate loans contractually due after one year totaled billion and loans with predetermined or fixed rates due after one year totaled million 
real estate loan concentration due to the rapid growth in population and the nature of the tourism and service industries found in the company s primary oregon and idaho markets  real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
real estate loans have historically represented a concentration of the company s overall loan portfolio and the acquired f m loan portfolio is similarly concentrated in real estate 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and a concentration of loans within the bank s market area 
management believes that  because of the strong historic and projected population in migration and related economic growth expected in the bank s markets  its real estate concentration risk is mitigated to an acceptable level over the long term 
however no assurance can be given that the company s assessment of its real estate risk will be accurate in either the short or long term 
commercial real estate cre loans represent the largest category within the loan portfolio at approximately of total loans outstanding as of december  approximately of cre loans are made to owner occupied users of the commercial property  while of cre loans are to obligors who do not directly occupy the property 
the expected source of repayment of cre loans is generally the operations of the borrower s business  rents or the obligor s personal income 
management believes that commercial real estate collateral may provide an additional measure of security for loans 
management believes lending to owner occupied businesses mitigates  but does not eliminate  commercial real estate risk 
the following table shows the breakdown of the two cre categories dollars in thousands of of of total total total commercial real estate cre cre cre owner occupied    non owner occupied   real estate construction loans represent of total loans and include residential commercial development loans as well as lot loans 
growth in construction lot lending reflects the acquisition of f m 
with the continued economic growth and in migration into the company s markets  speculative construction has been strong with larger developers operating in cascades markets 
this has increased the number of homes under development construction at any given time 
the effect of recent national and regional slowing in real estate markets is being monitored closely by management and the rate of growth in this portfolio is expected to moderate accordingly 
see the following table dollars in thousands of of of total total total real estate construction lot loans cre cre cre residential construction to homeowner  commercial construction   residential speculative construction   developer builder    residential construction loans are generally made to customers who own the property and whose credit profile supports permanent mortgage take out financing at the end of the construction phase 
the company maintains a list of approved local contractors  and the experience and background of contractors may factor into its lending decisions 
commercial construction loans finance the development and construction of commercial properties 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the operations of the borrower s business or the obligor s personal income 
speculative construction loans increased relative to residential and commercial construction 
this reflects the increasing capacity of the company to serve larger development clientele and is a function of the overall growth in population within the communities served by the bank 
residential speculative construction lending finances builders developers of residential properties 
such loans may include financing the development and or construction of residential subdivisions 
this activity may involve financing land purchase  infrastructure development ie roads  utilities  etc  as well as construction of residences or multi family dwellings for subsequent sale by developer builder 
because the sale of developed properties is integral to the success of developer business  loan repayment may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market values 
all of the above lending activities are subject to the varied risks of real estate lending 
such activity is subject to specialized underwriting  collateral and approval requirements  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk that loans may not be repaid 
lending and credit management the company has a comprehensive risk management process to control  underwrite  monitor and manage credit risk in lending 
the underwriting of loans relies principally on an analysis of an obligor s historical and prospective cash flow augmented by collateral assessment  credit bureau information  as well as business plan assessment 
ongoing loan portfolio monitoring is performed by a centralized credit administration function including review and testing of compliance to loan policies and procedures 
internal and external auditors and bank regulatory examiners periodically sample and test certain credit files as well 
risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  which could result in the classification of such loans as non performing 
certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
reserve for losses on loans and unfunded commitments this reserve represents management s recognition of the assumed and present risks of extending credit and the possible inability or failure of the obligors to make repayment 
the reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses on loans and unfunded commitments based on management s assessment of a variety of current factors affecting the loan portfolio 
such factors include loss experience  review of problem loans  current economic conditions  and an overall evaluation of the quality  risk characteristics and concentration of loans in the portfolio 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
no assurance can be given that  in any particular period  loan losses will not be sustained that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that changing economic factors or other environmental conditions could cause increases in the loan loss provision 
the bank s ratio of reserve for losses on loans and unfunded commitments to total loans has been relatively stable for the last several years reflecting solid credit quality metrics over this time period 
the reserve was at december  compared to at december   and at december  at this date  management believes that its reserve is at an appropriate level under current circumstances and prevailing economic conditions 
effective in the fourth quarter of  the bank began classifying reserves for unfunded commitments as a liability on the balance sheet 
prior to  unfunded commitments were classified in accordance with industry practice of other banks in our peer group 
reserves for unfunded commitments totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
provision for loan loss and unfunded commitments provision expense is determined by the company s ongoing analytical and evaluative assessment of the adequacy of the reserve for losses on loans and unfunded commitments 
credit quality metrics currently indicate sound credit quality  with low delinquent loans  modest net loan charge offs and stable non performing assets 
provision expense for was million  up from million in  and compares to million in the increase is reflective of the larger size of the loan portfolio owing to the acquisition of f m as well as strong organic loan growth during the year 
allocation of reserve for losses on loans and unfunded commitments the following table allocates the reserve for loan losses among major loan types 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology to estimate and evaluate the inherent risk within the loan portfolio in order to estimate the reserve 
the company s methodology segments the loan portfolio into various risk categories and pools 
appropriate base reserve rates are established based on historical loss rates 
economic and concentration adjustments are also applied to selected categories and pools to reflect current economic conditions and concentration risk 
the consumer reserve allocation is based mainly upon credit scoring methodology 
specific impairment evaluations are conducted on loans in accordance with sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
the unallocated portion of the reserve is based upon factors not measured in the allocated or specific reserves  and or relate to the margin of imprecision inherent in the estimation of such reserves 
factors include uncertainties in economic or environmental conditions  uncertainty in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet been manifested in historical loss experience 
examples of such factors could include originating loans in new or unfamiliar markets  initiating new loan programs or products  or initiating specialty lending to industry sectors that may be new to the company 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate  the total reserve for loan losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
in the table below the higher allocation to commercial loans was primarily a result of applying higher relative reserves to certain loans based upon ongoing credit quality monitoring and assessment 
typical factors leading to changes in reserve allocation on specific credits may include changes in debt service coverage ratios  guarantor and or collateral strength and economic factors impacting the obligor 
in percentage terms the reserve allocation to construction lot lending is consistent across the time periods presented  however the absolute size of this portfolio increased due to substantial speculative construction portfolio growth in the following table sets forth the allocation of the reserve for loan losses dollars in thousands reserve for allocated loan reserve for allocated loan loan and reserve as category loan and reserve as category commitment a of loan as a of commitment a of loan as a of losses category total loans losses category total loans commercial   real estate construction lot   mortgage  commercial   consumer   committed unfunded   unallocated   total reserve for loan losses   reserve for allocated loan reserve for allocated loan loan and reserve as category loan and reserve as category commitment a of loan as a of commitment a of loan as a of losses category total loans losses category total loans commercial   real estate construction lot   mortgage commercial   consumer   committed unfunded   unallocated  total reserve for loan losses   reserve for allocated loan loan and reserve as category commitment a of loan as a of losses category total loans commercial  real estate construction lot  mortgage commercial  consumer  committed unfunded unallocated total reserve for loan losses  the following table summarizes the company s reserve for loan losses and charge off and recovery activity for each of the last five years dollars in thousands year ended december  loans outstanding at end of period   average loans outstanding during the period      reserve balance  beginning of period    recoveries commercial real estate construction mortgage commercial consumer loans charged off commercial real estate construction mortgage commercial consumer   net loans charged off  provision charged to operations      reserves acquired from cbgp reserve for unfunded commitments  reserves acquired from f m  reserve balance  end of period     ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding

the accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when  in management s judgment  the future collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt 
loans placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time of such determination  and may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse  and charge against current income  interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest subsequently collected on such loans is credited to loan principal if  in the opinion of management  full collectibility of principal is doubtful 
interest income that was reversed and charged against income for the years of  and was insignificant 
during our normal loan review procedures  a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are currently measured at lower of cost or fair value 
certain large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  collectively measured for impairment  are excluded 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
in addition  net overdraft losses are included in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses per the guidance provided by regulatory authorities early in  joint guidance on overdraft protection programs 
at december   the company s recorded investment in certain loans that were considered to be impaired was million and specific valuation allowances were 
million 
impaired loans were insignificant at year end investment portfolio the following table shows the carrying value of the company s portfolio of investments at december    and dollars in thousands

the separate account boli was purchased in the fourth quarter of as an investment expected to provide a long term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit plans 
the fair value of the general account boli is based on the insurance contract cash surrender value 
the cash surrender value of the separate account boli is the quoted market price of the underlying securities  further supported by a stable value wrap  which protects against changes in the fair market value of the investments 
deposit liabilities and time deposit maturities increases in all deposit categories during were primarily due to the f m acquisition in april total deposits averaged billion for the full year  up or million from the prior year average 
average non interest bearing demand was up million or and average interest bearing demand including money market deposits was up million or 
at december   total deposits were billion  an increase of million or compared to year end mainly owing to the f m acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  cascade implemented its relationship banking strategy in idaho  allowing certain rate sensitive deposits in idaho to run off  resulting in a decline in deposits at f m between april and december of of approximately million 
this decline includes balances of several large customers that were repositioned into non deposit off balance sheet investment alternatives offered by cascade 
to offset this decline and fund its strong asset growth  cascade subsequently utilized brokered and cdars deposits 
at december   such brokered deposits totaled million and cdars deposits totaled approximately million 
rates paid on all interest bearing deposit categories increased in as the federal reserve continued its program to push market rates higher 
in addition  the brokered deposits discussed above carry rates that are often at higher national market levels 
historically  cascade has had a relatively high proportion of its deposits in non interest bearing accounts 
however  especially during the latter half of  non interest bearing balances eased to approximately of total deposits as of year end  compared to a full year average of 
while it is not atypical for cascade s deposits to seasonally slow or even decline modestly late in the year after the peak summer construction season  the decline in appears to be exacerbated as a consequence of the nation wide slowing in real estate activity following the excessive pace of and early average time deposits during increased million to million as compared to averages 
time deposits acquired in the f m transaction account for the majority of this increase 
the remainder of the increase in time deposits resulted from the use of national market brokered cd s that were part of the company s wholesale funding strategies in in addition  the bank began using the cdars program in as noted above 
of the increase in average time deposits during  brokered cd s and cdars accounted for approximately million and million  respectively 
the company does not aggressively market time deposits within local markets as they are not believed to be key to its relationship banking strategy

core relationship deposits are the primary source of the bank s liquidity 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
management views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
the bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts  and a lesser percentage in time deposits 
time deposits increased in in part due to use of brokered cd s where the bank pays national market rates see deposit liabilities section above 
the bank s present funding mix is diverse  with approximately of its checking account balances arising from business and public accounts and from consumers 
the composition of money market and interest bearing demand accounts was business and consumer 
management invests excess funds in short term and overnight money market instruments 
since december   the average amount of overnight investments declined by approximately million on average  with such funds redeployed to partially fund loan growth 
at december   total borrowings included cascade s issuance of approximately million in junior subordinated trust preferred securities 
a further source of funds and liquidity is the company s capability to borrow from reliable counterparties 
the bank utilizes its investment securities  certain loans  fhlb stock and certain deposits to provide collateral to support its borrowing needs 
company policy requires the analysis and testing of liquidity to ensure ample cash flow is available under a range of circumstances 
management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowing through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available 
however  depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition  economic or market situations including relative returns available in stock or bond markets or other unforeseen circumstances  which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions 
the bank s primary counterparty for borrowing purposes is the federal home loan bank fhlb 
at december   the fhlb had extended the bank a secured line of credit of million that may be accessed for short or long term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral 
as of december   the bank had collateral with which to pledge for fhlb borrowings totaling million 
the bank also had million in short term borrowing availability from the federal reserve bank that requires specific qualifying collateral 
in addition  the bank maintained unsecured lines of credit totaling million for the purchase of funds on a short term basis from several commercial bank counterparties 
at december   the bank had remaining available borrowing capacity on its aggregate lines of credit totaling million given sufficient collateral 
however at year end the company s collateral availability limited such borrowing capacity to approximately million in aggregate 
liquidity may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
historically a significant portion of such commitments such as lines of credit have expired or terminated without funding 
in addition  more than one third of total commitments pertain to various construction projects 
under the terms of such construction commitments  completion of specified project benchmarks must be certified before funds may be drawn 
at december  the bank had approximately million in outstanding commitments to extend credit  compared to approximately million at year end management believes that the bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business 
junior subordinated debentures at december   the company held million of trust preferred securities tps 
in  the company issued trust preferred securities totaling  of which million was used to fund the cash portion of the f m acquisition and million to support general corporate purposes and to augment regulatory capital 
management believes the securities qualify as tier regulatory capital and are priced at a competitive level 
the company s obligations under the debentures and related agreements  taken together  constitute a full and irrevocable guarantee by the company of the obligations of the trusts 
the tps are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures  or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture related to the debentures 
the tps may be called by the company at par at varying times subsequent to september   and may be redeemed earlier upon the occurrence of certain events that impact the income tax or the regulatory capital treatment of the tps 
see footnote of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details 
other borrowings the company has increased its total borrowings at year end to fund its strong organic loan growth and also because of its strategy to allow certain rate sensitive f m deposits to runoff during the year 
at december  the bank had a total of approximately million in term borrowings from fhlb with maturities from to  bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  at december   the bank had short term borrowings with fhlb and frb of approximately million and million  respectively 
a year earlier at december  the bank had a total of million in term borrowings from fhlb bearing a weighted average interest rate of  and short term borrowings with frb of approximately million 
see liquidity and sources of funds section on page for further discussion 
capital resources the company s total stockholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million from december  the increase primarily resulted from the issuance of stock in connection with the acquisition of f m in the amount of million  net income for the full year of million  less cash dividends paid to shareholders of million during the same period 
in addition  at december   the company had accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately 
million 
management believes that the capital resources of the company will be adequate to meet its needs for the reasonable foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and asset and liability management the goal of the company s asset and liability management policy is to maximize long term profitability under the range of likely interest rate scenarios 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
management hires and engages a qualified independent service provider to assist in modeling  monthly reporting and assessing interest rate risk 
the company s methodology for analyzing interest rate risk includes simulation modeling as well as traditional interest rate gap analysis 
while both methods provide an indication of risk for a given change in interest rates  it is management s opinion that simulation is the more effective tool for asset and liability management 
the company has historically adjusted its sensitivity to changing interest rates by strategically managing its loan and deposit portfolios with respect to pricing  maturity or contractual characteristics 
the company may also target the expansion or contraction of specific investment portfolio or borrowing structures to further affect its risk profile 
in addition  the company is authorized to enter into interest rate swap or other hedging contracts with re pricing characteristics that tend to moderate interest rate risk 
however  there are no material structured hedging instruments in use at this time 
because of the volatility of market rates  event risk and other uncertainties described below  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve its interest rate risk objectives 
to assess and estimate the degree of interest rate risk  the company utilizes a sophisticated simulation model that estimates the possible volatility of company earnings resulting from changes in interest rates 
management first establishes a wide range of possible interest rate scenarios over a two year forecast period 
such scenarios include a stable or unchanged scenario and an estimated or most likely scenario given current and forecast economic conditions 
at this time  the estimated scenario approximates market expectations as to the pace and magnitude of fed funds rate increases as implied by the euro dollar yield curve 
in addition  scenarios titled rising rates and declining rates are established to stress test the impact of more dramatic rate movements that are perceived as less likely  but may still possibly occur 
next  net interest income and earnings are simulated in each scenario 
note that earnings projections include the effect of estimated loan and deposit growth that management deems reasonable  however  such volume projections are not varied by rate scenario 
simulated earnings are compared over a two year time horizon 
the following table defines the market interest rates used in the model for estimated most likely  rising and declining interest rate scenarios 
these market rates shown are reached gradually over the year simulation horizon 
actual market estimated declining rising rates at rates at rates at rates at december december december december federal funds rate prime rate yield curve spread mo 
to year treas 



the following table presents percentage changes in simulated future earnings under the above described scenarios as compared to earnings under the stable or unchanged rate scenario calculated as of this year end 
the effect on earnings assumes no changes in non interest income or expense between scenarios 
first twelve month second twelve month th month average change in average change in change in stable rate scenario compared to pro forma net income pro forma net income pro forma net income estimated rate scenario 
rising rate scenario declining rate scenario management s assessment of interest rate risk and scenario analysis must be taken in the context of market interest rates and overall economic conditions 
since mid  the federal reserve has engineered a gradual rising in short term market interest rates 
meanwhile  long term rates remained relatively stable resulting in a flattening of yield curve between short and long term rates 
the yield curve suggests that market participants are anticipating a relatively stable rate environment over the next several years 
at year end  the national federal funds and prime borrowing rates were at and  respectively 
the above rate scenarios provide a relatively wide dispersion of possible outcomes  with the rising rate scenario modeling an outcome whereby fed funds rate increases significantly from at year end to at year end  while in the declining scenario rates fall from the current to a very low 
by the end of the horizon period 
meanwhile  the estimated scenario assumes fed funds remain at throughout the horizon period 
in management s judgment and at this date  the interest rate risk profile of the company is reasonably balanced within the most likely range of possible outcomes 
the model indicates that should future interest rates actually follow the most likely path estimated rate scenario  the net interest margin would range between to all else equal 
however with the more dramatic changes reflected in the rising or declining scenarios  the model suggests the margin would likely fall outside of this range should such interest rates actually occur 
this is mainly because the company has a large portion of non interest bearing funds approximately of total deposits that are assumed to be relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates 
thus in the event of rising rates  yields on earning assets would tend to increase at a faster pace than overall cost of funds  leading to an improving margin 
conversely  should rates fall to the very low levels assumed in the declining scenario  yields on loans and securities would compress against an already low cost of funds 
also in this declining rate scenario  the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate on loans currently outstanding that would refinance to lower rates  contributing to margin compression 
thus in the declining rate scenario where fed fund rates fall to just  the model indicates that the net interest margin could average approximately below the range noted above during the first months of the forecast horizon  and up to below during the second twelve months 
it should be noted that even under this scenario key financial performance benchmarks including roa and roe remain at sound levels though lower than in other scenarios 
management has concluded that the degree of margin and earnings volatility under the above scenarios is acceptable because of its relatively low likelihood as compared to the cost of mitigating such risk and because the model suggests that the company would still generate satisfactory returns under such circumstances 
please carefully review and consider the following information regarding the risk of placing undue reliance on simulation models  interest rate projections and scenario results 
in all scenarios discussed above  results are modeled using management s estimates as to growth in loans  deposits and other balance sheet items  as well as the expected mix and pricing thereof 
these volume estimates are static in the various scenarios 
such estimates may be inaccurate as to future periods 
model results are only indicative of interest rate risk exposure under various scenarios 
the results do not encompass all possible paths of future market rates  in terms of absolute change or rate of change  or changes in the shape of the yield curve 
nor does the simulation anticipate changes in credit conditions that could affect results 
likewise  scenarios do not include possible changes in volumes  pricing or portfolio management tactics that may enable management to moderate the effect of such interest rate changes 
simulations are dependent on assumptions and estimations that management believes are reasonable  although the actual results may vary substantially  and there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of future earnings under such conditions 
this is  in part  because of the nature and uncertainties inherent in simulating future events including no presumption of changes in asset and liability strategies in response to changing circumstances  model assumptions may differ from actual outcomes  uncertainties as to customer behavior in response to changing circumstances  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit volume changes  unexpected absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  unexpected behavior by competitors  other unanticipated credit conditions or other events impacting volatility in market conditions and interest rates 
interest rate gap table in the opinion of management  the use of interest rate gap analysis is less valuable than the simulation method discussed above as a means to measure and manage interest rate risk 
this is because it is a static measure of rate sensitivity and does not capture the possible magnitude or pace of rate changes 
at year end  the company s one year cumulative interest rate gap analysis indicates that rate sensitive liabilities maturing or available for repricing within one year exceeded rate sensitive assets by approximately million 
the company considers its rate sensitive assets to be those that either contains a provision to adjust the interest rate periodically or matures within one year 
these assets include certain loans and leases and investment securities and interest bearing balances with fhlb 
rate sensitive liabilities are those liabilities that are considered sensitive to periodic interest rate changes within one year  including maturing time certificates  savings deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and junior subordinated debentures
