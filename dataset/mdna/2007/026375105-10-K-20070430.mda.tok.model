our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia  new zealand and mexico  as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
our business exhibits seasonality  which is typical for most companies in the retail industry 
sales are higher in the second half of the year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
net earnings are highest during the months of september through december when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage 
working capital requirements needed to finance operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as inventory is increased in preparation for the peak selling season 
we recognized net income of million in compared to million in  on net sales of billion in compared to billion in as began  we focused on executing the two key operating and financial strategies outlined at the end of last year 
our primary operating strategy focuses on investing in growth through improving our core greeting card business and our principal financial strategy was to optimize our capital structure 
in addition  after optimizing our capital structure  we began executing against our goal of improving the return on net capital employed by divesting of businesses and product lines that are not providing adequate returns 
each of these activities impacted our consolidated financial statements during during the year  our financial results were impacted by the implementation of our strategy to invest in our core greeting card business investment in cards strategy and sbt implementations 
as we noted in our annual report on form k  we estimated that we would spend at least million over the next two years for these initiatives  including approximately million in the current year 
these activities have significantly reduced our sales and operating earnings during net sales were reduced approximately million for actions related to our investment in cards strategy and approximately million for sbt implementations 
the investment in cards strategy reduces net sales as credits issued to customers exceed new product shipments 
pre tax income was approximately million lower in the current year due to actions related to our investment in cards strategy and sbt implementations 
based on our current estimates  we expect the total spend on these two initiatives to approximate the originally planned amount of at least million by the end of in executing our financial strategy to optimize our capital structure  we completed a debt restructure and continued to invest in our own stock during during the year  we retired of our senior notes  
table of contents entered into a new credit agreement and issued million in senior notes 
during the year  we repurchased million of our class a common shares under our share repurchase programs and avoided issuing approximately million shares through our exchange offer for our convertible subordinated notes 
including the convertible debt  we reduced our total debt by approximately million and increased our financial flexibility going forward 
in an effort to improve long term return on net capital employed and focus on our core social expression business  during the fourth quarter of  we sold our candle product lines and signed an agreement to sell learning horizons  our educational products subsidiary 
we recognized a pre tax loss of approximately million in connection with the sale of our candle product lines 
we also recognized an after tax loss of approximately million upon signing an agreement to sell learning horizons 
this loss was included within discontinued operations 
the sale of learning horizons was completed during the first quarter of in addition  we closed underperforming retail stores during the fourth quarter and recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million 
the decline in consolidated net sales  in addition to the impact of the investment in cards strategy and sbt implementations  was primarily due to our north american social expression products segment  which experienced lower sales of gift packaging products  party goods  everyday cards and seasonal cards 
we also had lower sales in our retail operations segment  despite positive year over year comparative store sales growth  due to a reduced number of stores 
lower sales in the ag interactive segment were driven by the million of net sales from the extra two months in the prior year as discussed below and reduced offerings in the mobile product group  partially offset by sales from the acquisition of an online greeting card business during the second quarter of and growth in the online product group 
the results for the year included an after tax loss of approximately million from discontinued operations 
in addition to learning horizons  discontinued operations included the results of the hatchery  llc  our south african business unit for which the sale closed in the second quarter of  and magnivision 
an after tax gain of million was recorded in the third quarter based on the final closing balance sheet adjustments for the sale of magnivision 
the results for also included a gain of approximately million as a result of retailer consolidations  wherein  multiple long term supply agreements were terminated and a new agreement was negotiated with a new legal entity with substantially different terms and sales commitments 
we received cash of approximately million during the fourth quarter of as a result of this transaction 
on march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payments  using the modified prospective transition method 
as a result  stock based compensation expense recognized during was million and is included in administrative and general expenses on the consolidated statement of income

of the remaining unit decrease  approximately was related to the investment in cards strategy with the balance due to shortfalls in north america and the uk selling prices increased due to a lower overall mix of value cards compared to the prior year period 
seasonal card unit volume decreased compared to the prior year 
approximately of this decrease relates to the timing of shipments for the upcoming easter  mother s day and graduation seasons compared to the prior year and the impact of ongoing sbt conversions

from a timing perspective  we expect a recovery during the first quarter of the remaining decrease in units relates to weakness in all other seasons  particularly christmas and valentine s day 
seasonal selling prices increased compared to the prior year 
the overall increase in pricing from the prior year is driven by the timing of shipments discussed above and the mix of price points that shipped in the current year relative to the total pricing of those seasons

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of february  payment due by period as of february  in thousands thereafter total long term debt and capital leases operating leases commitments under customer agreements commitments under royalty agreements interest payments severance in addition to the contracts noted in the table  we issue purchase orders for products  materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of business 
these purchase orders typically do not include long term volume commitments  are based on pricing terms previously negotiated with vendors and are generally cancelable with the appropriate notice prior to receipt of the materials or supplies 
accordingly  the foregoing table excludes open purchase orders for such products  materials and supplies as of february  our senior notes due on august  may be put back to us on august   at the option of the holders  at of the principal amount provided the holders exercise this option between july  and august  although we do not anticipate that contributions will be required in to the defined benefit pension plan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of gibson greetings  inc in  we may make contributions in excess of the legally required minimum contribution level 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations evidenced by such events as bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings  a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs and current economic conditions 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required allowance balances 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
we also engage an independent valuation firm to assist with the fair value determination 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
our uk operation  included within the international social expression products segment  is a reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
and  as such  is the level that is tested for impairment of goodwill 
due primarily to declining results and cash flows in the past two years  the fair value of the uk business  determined for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment  has declined 
as a result  corporate management is closely monitoring the short term performance of this business 
to enable this monitoring  we have taken actions in this business to improve results of operations and cash flows  and established performance indicators within the business in order to assess the progress of the business throughout should this business fail to meet the established performance indicators  the goodwill in this business may require testing for impairment prior to the annual impairment test 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain a general allowance for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific allowance to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected performance 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  we periodically review the progress toward the volume commitment and estimate future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect our estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon our review  we may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
we do not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years as amounts  if any  have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 

table of contents the accuracy of our assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon our ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change 
sales returns we provide for estimated returns of seasonal cards and certain other seasonal products in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year seasonal sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation

these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following retail consolidations  acquisitions and bankruptcies  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  our ability to successfully implement our strategy to invest in our core greeting card business  the timing and impact of investments in new retail or product strategies as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  the ability to execute share repurchase programs or the ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from such repurchases  our ability to successfully complete  or achieve the desired benefits associated with  dispositions  a weak retail environment  consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  the impact of technology on core product sales  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  successful implementation of supply chain improvements and achievement of projected cost savings from those improvements  increases in the cost of raw materials  energy  freight and other production costs  our ability to comply with our debt covenants  fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where we operate  including the us dollar  euro  us pound sterling and canadian dollar  escalation in the cost of providing employee health care

additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments during  we entered into an interest rate derivative designed to offset the interest rate risk related to the forecasted issuance of million of senior indebtedness 
the interest rate derivative agreement expired during the year 
we did not designate this agreement as a hedging instrument pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the change in fair value of this agreement was recognized currently and included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 
we have no derivative financial instruments as of february  interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our new credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 
foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and net sales from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australasia  canada  mexico  the european union and the united kingdom are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates
