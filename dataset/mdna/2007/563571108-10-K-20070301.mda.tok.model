located in toledo  ohio  toledo ship repair performed ship repair and industrial repair services 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we decided we would divest of our wholly owned subsidiary  diversified refrigeration llc f k a diversified refrigeration  inc dri 
dri was our private label foodservice contract manufacturing operation 
on december   we completed the sale of dri to monogram refrigeration  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the general electric company 
during the second quarter of  we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  delta manlift sas delta 
we have reported the results of these operations as discontinued and have restated prior year amounts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
prior year amounts throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been restated to reflect the reporting of these operations as discontinued 
the manitowoc company  inc form k year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in this increase was the result of higher year over year sales in all three of our business segments 
sales in our crane  foodservice and marine segments increased  and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in changes in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in sales of million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the increases in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section below 
gross profit increased significantly for the year ended december  to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
gross margin increased in to from in the increase in consolidated gross profit and margin was driven by significantly higher gross margin in the crane segment due to increased volume and productivity gains 
in addition  the marine segment achieved gross profit of million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase was driven by profitability on new construction contracts and a strong repair year 
also  gross profit was adversely affected by a million contract reserve recorded during the fourth quarter 
for a more detailed discussion of this reserve  please see the marine segment analysis below 
the improved results in the crane and marine segments were countered to a small extent by a decrease in the foodservice segment s gross profit from in to in this decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volumes in our beverage division  higher material costs and costs related to the erp implementation 
engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by increases in the crane and marine segments and increased corporate expenses 
crane segment increases were due to higher selling expense  increased employee related costs  and increased research and development expenses 
marine segment increases were due to higher engineering costs  bidding costs related to potential new contracts and increased employee related costs 
corporate expenses increased primarily due to expensing of stock options  costs related to the company s offer to acquire enodis  plc and employee related costs 
es a expenses of the foodservice segment increased slightly  primarily as a result of es a associated with the mccann s engineering mfg 
co 
mccann s operations acquisition in interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from the company s redemption of the senior subordinated notes due during may of this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in the interest rate of our variable interest rate outstanding debt balances 
during may  we redeemed our senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the terms of the indenture  we paid the note holders percent of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
as a result of this redemption  we incurred a charge of million million  net of income taxes related to the call premium million  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs million and other expenses million 
the charge was recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  both periods were favorably affected  as compared to the statutory rate  by certain global tax planning initiatives 
the lower effective tax rate in was the result of lower earnings  a research and development tax credit  and the realization of certain tax benefits that were previously reserved against due to their uncertainty 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for the year ended december  reflects the operating results of our discontinued toledo ship repair operation 
the closure of toledo ship repair was completed during the first quarter of and no further operating results were realized from this operation 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in all three of our business segments reported increased sales in compared to sales in our crane  foodservice  and marine segments increased  and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in changes in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in sales of less than one percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the increases in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
gross margin decreased in to from in gross margin was negatively affected by a million reserve recorded in the marine segment during the fourth quarter of for a more detailed discussion of this reserve  please see the marine segment analysis below 
consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of over the consolidated gross profit for the same period in of million 
in addition to the impact of the marine segment reserve  comparative consolidated gross profit for the years ended december  and was affected by the following items i increased volumes in the crane and foodservice segments  ii favorable product mix and cost reductions implemented in recent years in the crane and foodservice segments  and iii production inefficiencies in the manitowoc company  inc form k the marine segment experienced during the completion of three specific new construction contracts during in addition  a significant amount of revenue in the marine segment for the third and fourth quarters of was from a first run prototype military vessel that is structured as a low margin cost plus contract 
es a increased to million in compared to million in  which is a million increase 
as a percentage of sales  es a declined to in  compared to in approximately million of this increase is the result of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during as compared to the remaining increase in es a in compared to is a result of the following i increase in research and development costs in the crane and foodservice segments for product development  ii increases in enterprise resource planning erp costs and costs related to the creation of a domestic shared service function within the foodservice segment  and iii higher employee benefit costs in across all three segments and at the corporate office 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge within the foodservice segment of million in connection with the consolidation of our kolpak operation located in wisconsin with our kolpak operation located in tennessee 
this action was taken in an effort to streamline our cost structure and utilize available capacity 
this charge included million to write down the wisconsin facility and land  which are held for sale  to estimated fair market value less cost to sell  million related to the write down of certain equipment to its estimated fair market value  million to write off excess inventory which was not transferred to tennessee  million related to severance and other employee related costs  and million for other related closing costs 
this charge has been included in restructuring and plant consolidation costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december  this decrease is the result of lower average debt levels and a lower euro versus us dollar exchange rate in  partially offset by an increase during in the variable interest rate portion of outstanding debt balances 
during june  we recorded a charge of million million net of income taxes to write off deferred financing costs related to the termination of our previous million revolving credit facility 
in addition  on january   we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes due as a result of this redemption  we incurred a charge of approximately million million net of income taxes 
this charge related to the prepayment premium of million paid to the note holders and the partial write off of debt issuance costs of million 
both of these charges were recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate from continuing operations was compared to for the year ended december  the tax rate for was favorably affected compared to the statutory rate by a research and development credit recorded during the second half of and certain global tax planning initiatives 
for the year ended december   earnings from discontinued operations represented the operating losses of toledo ship repair and the operating earnings of dri 
the gain on sale or closure of discontinued operations represented a million pre tax million after tax gain on the sale of dri and a million pre tax loss million after tax loss on the closure of toledo ship repair 
sales and operating earnings by segment operating earnings reported below by segment include the impact of reductions due to restructurings and plant consolidation costs  whereas these expenses were separately identified in the results of consolidated operations table above 
cranes and related products net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales from the crane segment for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion for the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year in all of the crane segments major geographic regions 
the crane segment continues to benefit from strong crane end market demand 
from a product line standpoint  the sales increase was driven by increased volume of crawler  tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  and increases in boom truck sales in north america 
as of december   total crane segment backlog was billion  a increase over the december  backlog of million  and a increase over the september  backlog of billion 
for the year ended december   the crane segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended the manitowoc company  inc form k december  operating earnings of the crane segment were favorably affected by increased volume across all regions and products  productivity gains as a result of consolidation efforts over the past several years  product mix  and effective leveraging of engineering  selling and administrative expenses on higher sales volume 
operating margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  strong factory performance  leveraging of fixed costs  and favorable pricing levels in all our regions contributed to the margin improvement 
year ended december  compared to net sales from the crane segment for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase occurred in all major geographic regions as well as in the segment s aftermarket sales and service business 
from a product line standpoint this sales increase was driven by increased volumes of tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  increased sales in the segment s aftermarket sales and service business  increased crawler crane sales in europe and asia  and increased boom truck sales in north america 
the stronger average euro currency over the us dollar in compared to had a less than one percent favorable impact on sales 
as of december   total crane segment backlog was million  a increase over the december  backlog of million 
for the year ended december   the crane segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  crane segment operating earnings for the year ended december  was affected by a charge of million related to restructuring activities 
the restructuring charge related to costs incurred during the second and third quarter of for the consolidation of certain of our european crane facilities 
this charge has been included in restructuring and plant consolidation costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  operating earnings of the crane segment for the year ended december  were favorably affected by increased volume across all regions and products  productivity gains as a result of consolidation efforts during the past several years  and effective leveraging of engineering  selling and administrative expenses on higher sales volumes 
for the year ended december   operating earnings were not significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchanges rates 
foodservice equipment segment net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales from the foodservice segment increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the sales increase during was driven by our ice and refrigeration divisions and the acquisition of mccann s 
the increases in our ice and refrigeration divisions were a result of both volume and pricing increases versus the prior year 
our beverage division benefited in from approximately million in revenue from mccann s which was acquired on may  the benefit of the mccann s acquisition was offset by reduced sales in our historical beverage businesses 
the decline in the historical business was primarily attributed to two major customer equipment refresh programs which benefited net sales in but did not recur in for the year ended december   the foodservice segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  results for the year ended december  was impacted by a million restructuring charge in connection with the consolidation of the segment s kolpak operation located in wisconsin into the segment s kolpak operation located in tennessee 
this action was taken in an effort to streamline our cost structure 
the charge included million to write down the value of the facility and land  which are now held for sale  to the estimated fair market value less the cost to sell  million related to the write down of certain equipment  million to write off excess inventory which was not transferred to tennessee  million related to severance and other employee related costs  and million for other related closing costs 
operating results for were adversely affected by approximately million due to increased commodity costs  specifically copper and aluminum 
the operating results of the foodservice segment for the year ended december  were also adversely affected by lower sales in our beverage division 
the mccann s acquisition benefited operating earnings by approximately million 
year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase was driven by higher sales in the ice and beverage divisions offset by slightly lower sales in the refrigeration division 
the increase occurred in both unit volume and higher prices 
the increase in pricing was in response to higher commodity costs experienced during the higher volumes in the ice and beverage divisions were driven by hotter than normal temperatures throughout much the manitowoc company  inc form k of the united states during the summer of the decrease in sales of the refrigeration division reflects a slowing in the rate of new restaurant construction in the united states and the timing of larger equipment replacement projects 
foodservice segment operating earnings of million for were down million from operating earnings of million in the decrease in operating earnings in is the result of a million restructuring charge for the consolidation of the kolpak facility located in river falls  wisconsin with the kolpak facility located in parsons  tennessee 
on a comparative basis  restructuring costs included in operating earnings of the foodservice segment for the year ended december  were million 
the restructuring charge relates to the closure of the european ice machine manufacturing business 
offsetting the restructuring charge were increases in operating earnings of both the ice and beverage divisions 
operating earnings for the year ended were positively impacted by increased sales volume 
the increased pricing discussed above was entirely offset by increases in commodity costs and did not have a favorable impact on operating earnings for the year ended december  operating earnings for the year ended december  were also negatively affected by the costs of the ongoing investment in a segment wide erp project within the foodservice segment and the creation of the domestic foodservice shared service function 
marine segment prior year sales and operating earnings of the marine segment have been restated for the discontinued operation of toledo ship repair 
net sales operating earnings loss operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales from our marine segment increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in sales was primarily the result of revenue generated from construction of the first option of the improved navy lighterage system inls  construction of several commercial articulated tug and barge combination projects and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs 
sales for also benefited from a very strong winter repair season 
for  the marine segment achieved operating earnings of million compared to a loss of million for the loss in was primarily the result of a million reserve recorded during the fourth quarter of we have been in negotiations with one of our marine segment customers to recover certain cost overruns that resulted primarily from specification inadequacies  change orders  cumulative disruption and constructive acceleration associated with a particular contract 
during the third quarter of  due to the fact that these negotiations were not successful within a timeframe satisfactory to us  we filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of these cost overruns from the customer 
the customer filed a counter claim against us in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we established a reserve of million to reflect the inherent uncertainties in litigation of this type 
the million reserve is recorded in cost of sales of the marine segment in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  if we are successful in our recovery of costs as a result of this lawsuit or negotiations  the favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows in a future period could be material 
the operating results benefited from the completion of certain fixed price contracts in  which were bid and awarded prior to the unprecedented rise in the costs of steel and other commodities during labor inefficiencies also impacted these projects in prior years 
the current marine segments contracts have better protections against commodity cost increases 
in addition  results were also favorably impacted by increased demand for certain commercial vessels with higher margins 
for  operating margins were adversely impacted by the fact that a significant percentage of the marine segment results were from a relatively low margin lcs contract which is a first run military prototype vessel that is structured as a cost plus contract 
year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales was primarily driven by several new construction vessels  as well as revenue from the navy prototype vessel 
during we completed the third staten island ferry for the city of new york  the initial production of the navy s inls lighterage system  a great lakes ice breaker  and four double hull tank barges 
also contributing to the increase in revenue in was the winter repair season revenue  which increased by approximately million compared to for  the marine segment reported a loss from operations of approximately million 
this loss is primarily the result of a million reserve recorded during the fourth quarter of in connection with the contract law suit mentioned above 
in addition to the million reserve  operating results were negatively affected by cost increases in material and production inefficiencies experienced on the manitowoc company  inc form k certain specific construction contracts 
labor inefficiencies were incurred due to delays and disruption caused by customer change orders and a larger mix of first time or limited vessel construction projects 
in addition  the large number of projects in process at the same time in our shipyards  a shortage of available specific skilled labor  and project rework requirements all resulted in greater than normal utilization of costlier subcontract labor on certain contracts 
finally  the majority of the marine segment revenues during the second half of the year were from a relatively low margin first run military prototype vessel that is structured as a cost plus contract 
at december   the marine segment had a growing backlog of projects that matched the capabilities of our two shipyards and a build schedule that allowed for a more efficient use of our resources 
in addition  all current contracts have terms that help shield manitowoc from future commodity price escalation 
general corporate expenses net sales corporate expenses of net sales year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased million to million in compared to million in expensing of stock options  which began during the first quarter of  increased corporate expenses by million in compared to also contributing to the increase in corporate expenses during was approximately million of legal and accounting expenses related to the company s unsuccessful efforts to acquire enodis  plc 
finally  corporate expenses during were impacted by higher employee related costs and other professional expenses 
year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of the following i costs incurred in setting up the accounts receivable securitization facility  ii costs incurred in the pursuit of potential acquisition targets  iii increased employee related costs  and iv higher depreciation costs on technical infrastructure investments 
market conditions and outlook during  we will strive to protect our market shares  improve our cost structures  and continue to invest in new product development 
with our increased global presence in our crane business and our continued focus to become more global in our foodservice businesses  we are affected now more than ever by non us world economies 
the economies of europe and asia  in particular  increasingly affect our performance 
we believe that our diversified business model  our increased global presence  our broad product offerings and our product line and geographic diversification within our segments proved beneficial to us in and will continue to provide stability to our company into the future 
cranes and related products the global crane market continued to strengthen in  which benefited most of our regional and product end markets  including our rough terrain  all terrain and crawler crane products 
price increases to recover material cost increases  improved manufacturing efficiency as a result of the higher crane volumes and other manufacturing cost reductions have contributed to the improved gross margins in the crane segment 
in  we expect to see some additional escalation in material costs  which we anticipate will again offset across the industry with pricing actions and we will look to mitigate through other cost reduction efforts 
during  we grew market share modestly within several product categories globally 
we responded to significant increases in demand in asia by opening a new crane manufacturing facility in china 
the crane segment continues to invest in all of its manufacturing facilities in an effort to increase production volumes to meet market demand 
the improvement in overall market share is partially a reflection of continued significant investment in new products  which is reflected by the introduction of new products in we will continue to invest in new products and product support in looking ahead  we expect volumes to increase significantly in north america in for all products due to continued growth in the cyclical crane industry  the impact of market share increases and overall market conditions 
we believe the north american construction equipment market as it relates to lifting equipment is in a growth phase of the cycle  which can last several years in duration 
further  the domestic crawler market  which tends to lag the overall crane market  continues a strong recovery with additional growth expected 
we expect asia will continue to grow significantly  driven by the china expansion and general recovery of asian economies 
on the other hand  we expect to see commodity costs rise in we have developed strategies to help us adapt to these conditions 
in this environment we plan to protect our market share by providing our customers with what we believe is the best value in the industry 
we will work to grow our market share globally by leveraging the strength of our brand names  product service and support  and expanded product offerings 
the manitowoc company  inc form k in  we plan to introduce new crane models 
we will continue to expand our global reach 
one way to achieve this expansion is through the continued expansion and strategic positioning of our service and product support infrastructure in asia 
in addition  our global sales force is cross selling our entire product lines 
our past acquisitions have given us a broad product offering and worldwide distribution and product support 
we believe these factors along with new product introductions will help us continue to grow market share in we believe that our growth strategy is solid and supported by the diversification of our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
we will continue to attack our markets geographically  rather than by product line 
foodservice equipment the domestic foodservice industry got off to a strong start in  stabilizing later in the year and resulting in a full year industry growth rate of to 
for  the foodservice segment introduced more than new products for the fifth consecutive year 
these new product introductions contributed to a continued market share gain in ice machines and steady sales in our other product categories 
dramatically rising commodity costs combined with supply availability throughout presented challenges in maintaining profit margins 
we reacted to these challenges by implementing selected price increases throughout our product lines  continuing to focus on cost reductions throughout our operations and by emphasizing the need of low cost country sourcing 
we are doing this in conjunction with company wide effort to coordinate and leverage the purchasing power of our three segments 
we expect that the same factors that drove our operating performance in will continue to drive our business in we expect that the market will grow in at a rate of approximately to and we believe we are positioned to outperform the industry due to the wide range of new products that we introduced in the past years and the new products scheduled for introduction 
we are also continuing to invest in foreign markets 
our new manufacturing and engineering center in hangzhou  china is complete  and we are expanding our capabilities in the asia pacific region 
we continue to increase our production capacity in beverage equipment and ice machines  and we will expand manufacturing to other foodservice products for the asia pacific region as the needs arise 
this increased presence will leverage our brand strength in the fastest growing foodservice equipment market in the world 
marine the marine segment benefited from the continued effects of the oil pollution act of opa which mandated retirement of all petroleum hauling single hull vessels by in  we delivered one articulating tug and double hull barge unit at b and one double hulled petroleum barge 
recent activity in response to the opa mandates has caused a production bottlenecks in us shipyards  which emphasizes the current lack of new construction building capacity in us shipyards 
our multi year backlog at bay shipbuilding is evidence of the increase demand for opa compliant vessels 
for  we will be completing construction of one at b and one double hull tank barge  and we will commence construction on three additional double hull tank barge units of various sizes 
government programs are also a staple for marine  as evidenced by the award of the us coast guard s response boat medium rb m program  and the us navy s award of options for the improved navy lighterage system 
work began on both of these programs in  and will continue through and beyond 
we will also be delivering the first littoral combat ship lcs freedom in  which is being constructed at our marinette marine yard 
future new construction work is also a possibility as we anticipate submitting bid proposals to both the us coast guard and us navy for upcoming programs in the months to follow 
another arena that the marine segment is exploring for future work is the reemerging activity for the us oil patch  alaskan north slope  and north sea 
the us oil patch has been looking for the replacement of older vessels operating in the gulf of mexico gom  but does not reflect the recently awarded us gom deepwater oil leases to major oil companies that will require new construction of large platform supply vessels psv and anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels to meet the new demand 
with recently awarded new exploration and drilling contracts in the alaskan north slope  near term demands exist for large polar ice breaking ahts vessels 
finally  with north sea drilling and production in full swing  strong market demands for large quantities of ahts vessels and psvs provide new construction opportunities for the marine segment 
great lakes repair and refurbishment exceeded our expectations for strong demand for our customers services filtered down to us to keep their vessels operating efficiently and effectively with minimal down time 
for  we managed major drydockings 
bay shipbuilding also executed on a ship re powering contract converting it from steam to heavy fuel diesel  the first of its kind on the great lakes 
continued strong demand for tonnage in the great lakes for should also yield favorable results for the new year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during was million compared to million in we applied a portion of this cash flow to capital spending  dividends and payment of outstanding debt 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   a decrease of million versus this overall decrease in cash is primarily the result of significant debt payments and capital expenditures made during in addition  we had million of unused availability under our secured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility at december  the availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced for outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  the manitowoc company  inc form k cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  cash flow during was driven by million of net earnings  an increase of million over net earnings for accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities positively impacted cash flow from operations with an increase of million 
the increase was driven primarily by increased payables related to the increase in inventory in the crane segment required to support the increase in production  and by down payments received from customers on commercial ships ordered during the year for which construction did not yet begin 
during  inventory increased by million  which was driven by higher backlog and product demand in the crane segment 
increased accounts receivable reduced cash flows from operations by million 
this increase was driven by the increase in sales  offset by a sale of receivables through our securitization facility discussed below 
the company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby it sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary which  in turn  sells participating interests in its pool of receivables to a third party financial institution purchaser 
the purchaser receives an ownership and security interest in the pool of receivables 
new receivables are purchased by the special purpose subsidiary and participation interests are resold to the purchaser as collections reduce previously sold participation interests 
the company has retained collection and administrative responsibilities on the participation interests sold 
the purchaser has no recourse against the company for uncollectible receivables  however  the company s retained interest in the receivable pool is subordinate to the purchaser s interest and is recorded at fair value 
due to a short average collection cycle of less than days for such accounts receivable and the company s collection history  the fair value of the company s retained interest approximates book value 
the retained interest recorded at december  is million  and is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the securitization program s capacity is million  and includes trade accounts receivable from its domestic crane and foodservice businesses 
trade accounts receivables sold to the purchaser and being serviced by the company totaled million at december   an increase of million from the balance sold to the purchaser at december  we spent a total of million during for capital expenditures 
we continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our business  to invest in new processes  products and technology  and to maintain high quality production standards 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures and depreciation by segment 
capital expenditures depreciation cranes and related products foodservice equipment marine corporate total the significant capital expenditures in include the continued investment in the foodservice segment s erp system  the new china manufacturing facilities in the crane and foodservice segments  production machinery and equipment  and new product tooling 
on may   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and business operated by mccann s 
headquartered in los angeles  california with operations in tijuana  mexico  mccann s is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of beverage dispensing equipment primarily used in fast food restaurants  stadiums  cafeterias and convenience stores

interest on the senior notes due is payable semiannually in may and november each year  the senior notes due can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after november  the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations of the company ranking subordinate in right of payment to all of our senior debt and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in february and august each year 
these notes can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after august  as of december   we also had outstanding million of other indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
this debt includes outstanding bank overdrafts in asia and europe  and various capital leases 
as of december   we had four fixed to floating rate swap contracts which effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due to variable rate debt 
these contracts are considered to be hedges against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as a liability of million as of december  debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts  as well as offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an ad the manitowoc company  inc form k justment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings for the year ended december  the fair value of these contracts  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  approximated a loss of million at december  our revolving credit facility  senior notes due  and senior subordinated notes due contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in general  the covenants contained in the revolving credit facility are more restrictive than those of the senior notes due and the senior subordinated notes due among other restrictions  these covenants require us to meet specified financial tests  which include the following consolidated interest coverage ratio  consolidated total leverage ratio  and consolidated senior leverage ratio 
these covenants also limit  among other things  our ability to redeem or repurchase our debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  and create or become subject to liens 
the revolving credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under any other debt agreements would result in default under the revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent months 
our debt position increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the revolving credit facility or other future facilities may be used for funding future acquisitions  seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  funds available under the revolving credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility no amount outstanding as of december  
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due and our senior notes due b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our historical activities at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to materially affect our credit ratings or would otherwise adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing 
d 
we have disclosed information related to guarantees in note to our consolidated financial statements 
e 
written options on non financial assets for example  real estate puts 
we do not have any written options on non financial assets 
off balance sheet arrangements our disclosures concerning transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows we have disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements our buyback and residual value guaranty commitments 
we also lease various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are also disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have disclosed our accounts receivable securitization arrangement in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows the manitowoc company  inc form k total committed thereafter debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total committed there were no significant purchase obligation commitments at december  table above does not include interest payments additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million 
we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees outstanding  that if all were satisfied in full at december   the total cash cost to us would be million  this amount is not reduced for amounts the company would recover from repossessing and subsequent resale of collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
the company has established the retirement plan committee the committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts 
our three us pension plans had benefit accruals frozen several years ago 
effective january   we merged all us pension plans together 
we are also making a contribution of approximately million during the first quarter of that will fully fund the ongoing us pension liability 
we will also change our investment policy to more closely align the interest rate sensitivity of our pension assets with the corresponding liabilities 
the resulting asset allocation will be approximately equity and fixed income 
this decision will remove a significant portion of the us pension s volatility due to unpredictable changes in interest rates and equity markets 
this decision will protect our balance sheet as well as support our goal of minimizing unexpected future pension cash contributions based upon the new provisions of the pension protection act and protect our employees benefits 
in  cash contributions to all pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in  we used interest rate swaps entered into with third party financial institutions such that approximately of our debt is fixed and is floating at december  at december   we had four fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding 
these swap contracts effectively convert million of our fixed rate senior subordinated and senior notes to variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between a floating rate and the fixed rate applied to million of our senior subordinated notes and senior notes 
these contracts are considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate obligations 
accordingly  these interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at december  as a liability of million  and the related debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract  as well as the offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in the fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings from these swaps for the year ended december  a increase or decrease in the floating rate we pay under these swap agreements would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end weighted average rate of the swaps was constant throughout the year 
interest swaps expose us to the risk that the counter party may be unable to pay amounts it owes us under the swap agreements 
to manage this risk we enter into swap agreements only with financial institutions that have high credit ratings 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  foam  and aluminum 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these the manitowoc company  inc form k programs are centralized across business segments  and others are specific to a business segment or business unit 
during  we entered into certain commodity hedges which become effective starting january  and began a program to systematically hedge these commodities going forward 
these hedges fix the price of certain of our key commodities utilized in the production of our foodservice product offerings 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominantly between our euro denominated operations and their customers outside the euro zone 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement date of the related transactions 
we also periodically hedge anticipated transactions  primarily at firm order date for orders to be sold into non euro denominated locations  with forward exchange contracts 
these forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts hedging underlying accounts receivable with a fair market value of million and forward exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders with a fair market value of million 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december   would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables 
any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders would not have a significant impact due to the relatively immaterial amount of contracts outstanding being hedged 
at december   there was also a significant portion of our foreign currency translation exposure that was not hedged due to the company paying off the senior subordinated notes due during amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december   is million
