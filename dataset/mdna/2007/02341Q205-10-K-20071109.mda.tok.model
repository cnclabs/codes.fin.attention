results of operations continuing operations sales changes in sales are driven by two primary components i changes to selling prices  which are largely controlled by our product suppliers  and excise taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products by various states  and ii changes in the volume of products sold to our customers  either due to a change in purchasing patterns resulting from consumer preferences or the fluctuation in the comparable number of business days in our reporting period

significant items impacting fiscal sales included the following items 
during fiscal  certain states imposed sizable increases in the excise taxes levied on cigarettes 
as excise taxes are passed on to our customers  the associated increase in our prices had the impact of increasing our fiscal sales by approximately million as compared to fiscal the increase in excise taxes also had the impact of decreasing the demand for cigarettes in the related states and accordingly reduced sales by approximately million 
also impacting fiscal cigarette sales were price increases implemented by major cigarette manufacturers during the fiscal year 
these price increases had the effect of increasing fiscal sales by approximately million as compared to fiscal the remaining change in cigarette sales as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in cigarette carton volumes in states not impacted by excise tax increases 
the million increase in tobacco  confectionary  food service and other product sales was primarily the result of price increases and changes in sales volumes 
sales from our retail health food segment increased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to overall growth in same store sales  primarily within our vitamin and supplements product categories

gross profit for the retail health food segment increased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal of this increase  approximately million related to higher sales volumes  with the remaining change primarily resulting from improved sales mix and improved inventory shrink and throw out costs 
operating expense operating expense includes selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization and impairment charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  warehousing costs and cost of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most significant expenses relate to employee costs  facility and equipment leases  transportation costs  insurance and professional fees 
total operating expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease in operating costs was primarily related to a million reduction in professional fees  with the remaining decrease primarily resulting from lower insurance and bad debt expense  partially offset by higher compensation costs

sales in our wholesale distribution segment increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in sales included a million decrease in cigarette sales and a million increase in the sales of our tobacco  confectionary and other product categories 
of the decrease in cigarette sales  million was a result of the change in our monthly reporting period  which added an extra week of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and million was the result of a decrease in the volume of carton shipments excluding the extra week 
these decreases in cigarette sales were offset by a million increase in sales due to higher excise taxes imposed by certain states and a million benefit to sales attributable to price increases implemented by major cigarette manufacturers 
sales from our retail health food segment increased million  or  during fiscal when compared to fiscal of this sales increase  million was attributable to sales growth in same store sales  primarily within our grocery and supplements product categories 
this increase in sales volume was partially offset by a million reduction in sales due to an extra week of sales in the fiscal  resulting from the company s change in reporting periods

selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  warehousing costs and cost of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most significant expenses relate to employee costs  facility and equipment leases  transportation costs  insurance and professional fees 
total operating expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal  or  from fiscal the decrease in operating expense from fiscal was primarily attributable to a reduction in intangible impairment charges incurred during fiscal the company incurred no such impairment charges in fiscal other significant items impacting operating expenses during fiscal included higher fuel and professional services expenses of million and million  respectively  and a million reduction in workers compensation expense  as compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to an increase in the company s average variable rate borrowings  the impact of the expiration of an interest rate swap in fiscal which had the effect of converting million in variable rate borrowings under the company s credit facility to a fixed borrowing rate of  and increases in the prime interest rate  which is the rate at which the company primarily borrows 
on average  the company s borrowing rates on variable rate debt were higher and the average borrowings on variable rate debt were million higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal other during fiscal  the company allocated million in losses  net of tax  to minority interest  which was related to a minority ownership interest in the company s tsi subsidiary 
after this allocation  the minority ownership interest in tsi had been reduced to zero resulting from cumulative tsi loss allocations 
the minority shareholders provided no additional funding to tsi 
accordingly  no further allocations of losses to minority shareholders were made by the company in fiscal or thereafter 
the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal the change in effective tax rates from fiscal was primarily attributable to valuation allowances placed on state net operating losses in fiscal  which reduced the income tax benefit and related effective tax rate in that fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources overview operating activities 
the company requires cash to pay operating expenses  purchase inventory and make capital investments 
in general  the company finances these cash needs from the cash flow generated by its operating activities  credit facility borrowings and preferred stock issuances  as necessary 
during fiscal  the company generated cash of approximately million from operating activities 
the cash generated was primarily the result of net income generated  changes in deferred income tax balances  and adjustments for depreciation  partially offset by a pay down of accounts payable and accrued expenses related to discontinued operations 
our variability in cash flows from operating activities is heavily dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  periodically we have inventory buy in opportunities which offer more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we may have to hold inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates a cash outflow from operating activities which we expect to reverse in later periods 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our peak time of operations  we generally carry higher amounts of inventory to ensure high fill rates and maintain customer satisfaction 
investing activities 
the company generated approximately million in cash from investing activities during fiscal of the cash generated  approximately million resulted from the sale of hnwc s assets in november and million related to the sale of tsi s distribution warehouse 
both of these items were included as components of our discontinued operations 
these items were partially offset by million in capital expenditures less million in cash proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
financing activities 
the company used net cash of million for financing activities during fiscal of this net change in cash  the company used cash of million for principal payments on its bank credit facility  million for principal payments on long term debt for both continuing and discontinued operations  million related to debt issuance costs  and million for the payment of preferred stock dividend payments 
cash on hand working capital 
as of september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million

del 
credit agreement the company s primary source of borrowing for liquidity purposes is its revolving credit facility with lasalle bank the facility 
the significant terms of the facility at september include a million revolving credit limit  plus the outstanding balances on two term notes term note a and term note b which totaled approximately million at september for a total credit facility limit of million at september bears interest at the bank s prime interest rate  except for term note b which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
maturity and expiration dates for the facility and term note a of april and march for term note b 
lending limits subject to accounts receivable and inventory limitations  an unused commitment fee equal to per annum on the difference between the maximum loan limit and average monthly borrowings 
a prepayment penalty of one percent of the prepayment loan limit of million if prepayment occurs on or before april  provides that the company may not pay dividends on its common stock in excess of per share on an annual basis 
the facility also includes quarterly debt service and cumulative earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda financial covenants 
beginning with the fiscal quarter ended september   the company must maintain a minimum debt service ratio of to  as measured by the twelve month period then ended 
the cumulative minimum ebitda requirements are as follows a  for the three months ending december  and december  and  b  for the six months ending march   and march  and  c  for the nine months ending june  and  d  for the twelve months ending september  and september  the company was in compliance with the required debt service and minimum ebitda covenants at september  the company s maximum available credit limit of the revolving portion of the facility was million at september  however  the amount available for use at any given time is subject to many factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances that are evaluated on a daily basis 
at september  the outstanding balance on the revolving portion of the facility was million 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to the bank s prime rate  which was at september based on our collateral and loan limits as defined by the facility agreement  the company s excess availability under the facility at september was approximately million 
during fiscal  our peak borrowings under the facility were million and our average borrowings and average availability were and million  respectively 
our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels go up because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on collateralized assets 
as a component of the credit agreement  the company has two term notes  term note a and term note b  with lasalle bank 
term note a bears interest at the bank s prime rate at september and is payable in monthly installments of  term note b bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus at september and is payable in monthly installments of  the outstanding balances on term note a and term note b were million and million  respectively  as of september the company s chairman has personally guaranteed repayment of the facility and the term loans 
however  the amount of his guaranty is capped at million and is automatically reduced by the amount of the repayment on term note b  which resulted in the guaranteed principal outstanding being reduced to approximately million as of september amcon pays the company s chairman an annual fee equal to of the guaranteed principal in return for the personal guarantee 
this guarantee is secured by a pledge of the shares of chamberlin s  akin s  hnwc and tsi 
the company s chairman has also personally guaranteed a note payable issued in conjunction with the television events and marketing  inc team litigation settlement as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements under item the company pays the chairman an annual fee equal to of the guaranteed principal in return for the personal guarantee 
the amount guaranteed in connection with this settlement at september was approximately million

the settlement also restructured the company s obligations arising from the asset purchase agreement with cph totaling approximately million into a new million note payable to cph 
the million note payable is due at the end of five years plus accrued interest at 
items restructured into the million note payable included cph s minority interest in tsi  water royalties payable to cph  notes payable to cph  and accrued interest payable to cph 
additionally  the agreement provides cph with an eleven month option to purchase tsi s assets for a price equivalent to the amount due cph under the million note payable  plus accrued interest 
the tsi asset purchase option can be extended an additional seven months at cph s election 
no monetary exchanges between the company and cph were required under the settlement agreement 
the company has recorded a million pre tax deferred gain in connection with the above settlement 
this deferred gain has been classified as a component of noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations in the company s september consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred gain will be recognized upon the earlier of cph s election to exercise its tsi asset purchase option or the expiration of the asset purchase option 
with the final settlement of the cph litigation  the company does not expect its future cash flows to be significantly impacted by future tsi related litigation 
cross default and co terminus provisions the company s owned real estate in bismarck  nd  quincy  il  and rapid city  sd  and certain warehouse equipment in the rapid city  sd warehouse is financed through term loans with marshall and ilsley bank m i  which is also a participant lender on the company s revolving line of credit 
the m i loans contain cross default provisions which cause all loans with m i to be considered in default if any one of the loans where m i is a lender  including the revolving credit facility  is in default 
in addition  the m i loans contain co terminus provisions which require all loans with m i to be paid in full if any of the loans are paid in full prior to the end of their specified terms 
dividend payments the company does not pay dividends on its common stock but does periodically reevaluate this policy based on the funding requirements necessary to finance operations and future growth

critical accounting estimates certain accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements require us to make judgments and estimates and the financial results we report may vary depending on how we make these judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a weekly basis and assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that our current level of allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate at september and that our credit exposure is very low compared with the high volume of sales and the nature of our industry in which collections are generally made quickly 
however  for every percent of receivables deemed to require an additional reserve at september  the impact on the statement of operations would be to increase selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories consist primarily of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products that we carry to better serve our customers  there is a risk of impairment in inventory that is unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete or is discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
in addition  we may discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management s evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets that were acquired in business combinations 
fixed assets and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill is not amortized 
impairment of reporting units  which is measured in the company s fourth fiscal quarter in order to coincide with its budgeting process  is evaluated annually with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist 
the reporting units are valued using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
no impairment charges were recorded by the company in fiscal or fiscal fiscal impairment during fiscal  management determined that a portion of the tradenames and goodwill in our retail and former beverage segments were impaired  based on valuations obtained from an independent valuation specialist 
the impairments recorded in our retail and former beverage segment tsi hnwc were the result of projected shortfalls in operating cash flows necessary to support the reporting units carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist using the expected present value of the discounted future cash flows and consideration of the net recoverable values 
the impairment charges for our retail segment are recorded in the company s statement of operations as a component of income loss from continuing operations 
as previously discussed  the operations of tsi and hnwc were subsequently closed or sold 
accordingly  the impairment charges for tsi and hnwc are included in the statement of operations under the caption  loss from discontinued operations 
a summary of the impairment charges by entity for fiscal are as follows in millions caption continuing discontinued total operations operations retail tsi hnwc total 
del long lived assets goodwill water source customer list tradename del 
nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company s long lived assets 
in regard to the impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management s estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses used by the independent third party valuation specialist 
assumptions and approach used 
for fixed assets  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
in evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets we primarily use an income based approach discounted cash flow method in addition to both public and private company information 
a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management s evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets and amortizable intangibles are appropriate 
if we shortened the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets by one year  the impact on the statement of operations for the current period would be to increase depreciation expense by approximately million 
insurance the company s insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on analysis and consultation with our third party administrator  our experience is such that we have a one month lag period in which claims are reported 
workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior year s loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we utilize the assistance of our insurance agent to trend and develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
our insurance agent uses standard insurance industry loss development models 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that our current reserve for incurred but unreported insurance claims is adequate at september however  for every percent increase in claims  an additional reserve of approximately  would be required at september  the impact of which would increase selling  general and administrative expenses by that amount in the same period 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position  historical financial information  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
sensitivity analysis 
based on our analysis  we have determined that no valuation allowance was required at september revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale segment when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers when earned under established program requirements 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 
sensitivity analysis 
based on the historical information used to estimate the reserves for sales discounts and volume sales incentives  we do not anticipate significant variances from the amounts reserved 
however  there could be significant variances from period to period based on customer make up and programs offered 
our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future
