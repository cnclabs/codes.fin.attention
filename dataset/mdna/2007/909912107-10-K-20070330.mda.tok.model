net income for the year ended december  was million or per basic share compared to million or per basic share for the year ended december  the results were favorably impacted by the reversal of million in long term and deferred income tax liabilities related to certain tax matters for which the statue of limitations has expired 
the company s historical results have been significantly affected by the timing of events including the sale of marketable securities and real estate assets  which were dependent upon economic conditions at the time of the sale 
the company is unable to predict if or when such events will recur 
real estate operations the company s real estate operations consist of the real estate investment and management and hotel operations segments 
the operating results for these segments are as follows year ended year ended in thousands december  d ecember  real hotel real hotel estate operations total estate operations total revenues     mortgage interest expense depreciation expense    other operating expenses     operating income    real estate investment and management revenues from the real estate investment and management segment increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of lease renewals at higher rents million partially offset by recurring tenant turnover million 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company recognized additional revenue from a non recurring transaction 
million 
in general  rental revenues from the company s real estate properties do not fluctuate significantly due to the long term nature of the company s leases 
however  future rental revenues could be affected by lease renewals  terminations  step ups and escalations and by the purchase or sale of additional properties 
mortgage interest expense amounted to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to  as a result of continuing mortgage amortization 
at december   the outstanding mortgage balance on the company s real estate investment properties was reduced to million 
mortgage interest expense on existing obligations of the company s real estate investment and management segment will continue to decline with scheduled principle reductions 
depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced depreciation expense associated with certain properties or improvements becoming fully depreciated in the current and prior year  partially offset by depreciation from current year additions 
due to the may purchase of a commercial property and other expenditures for capital improvements incurred during the current year  depreciation expense on the company s properties should increase in future years 
other operating expenses associated with the management of real properties increased  or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in the increase is primarily related to a property converted from a triple net lease  in and the receipt of non recurring tenant reimbursements  in hotel operations the hotel operations segment consists of three hotels 
the company acquired a hotel in november  located in windsor locks  connecticut the connecticut hotel 
the increases in hotel operating revenues and related mortgage interest  depreciation and other operating expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  are primarily the result of the acquisition of the connecticut hotel 
mortgage interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to  which is related to the connecticut hotel mortgage

the operating results of the engineered products segment are as follows year ended december  in thousands net sales   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   operating income   net sales of the engineered products segment decreased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  this is primarily due to decreased demand in the company s automotive product line which is a result of continued softening of sales in the automotive industry  as well as competitive price pressures  offset by an increase in the company s transformer product line 
although management believes that sales of its engineered products segment are directly influenced by general economic conditions  worldwide automotive demand and industrial capital spending  future sales of this segment could also be affected by changes in technology  competitive forces or challenges to its intellectual property 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased less than for the year ended december   compared to  primarily related to an increase in the cost of raw materials  principally copper components  which  where possible  have been passed along to customers 
in addition  the mix of products sold  discussed above  also contributed to the increase 
continued increases in the price of raw materials could effect the gross margin and operating profit of the engineered products segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segment decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to the decrease is primarily due to decreases in travel and related expenses  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturing operations increased million or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in this increase primarily relates to compensation expense associated with unvested stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  an increase in compensation and benefits  and a non recurring transaction  in as of december   there were no unrecognized compensation costs relating to share based payments 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net was million in as compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to gains in on the sale of the company s interest in a joint venture which owns and operates a hotel located in quebec  canada  as well as the sale by a joint venture which owned and operated a hotel located in new jersey of its underlying assets income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  was favorably impacted by the reversal of million in long term and deferred income tax liabilities related to certain tax matters for which the statue of limitations has expired

the aggregate proceeds from these transactions were million  resulting in a gain of million  on a net of tax basis 
results of operations and total revenues for the year ended december  were million  generating income from continuing operations and net income of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   total revenues were million  generating income from continuing operations and net income of million and million  respectively 
the company recognized million of interest and dividend income during  an increase of million or over  primarily as the result of higher interest rates and the increased investment in dividend paying securities 
the results include million in gains on the sale of available for sale securities and million in gains on the sale of real estate  on a net of tax basis  above those recognized in in addition  the results include the tax benefit from several charitable donations of real estate made by the company during that year 
real estate operations the company s real estate operations consist of the real estate investment and management and hotel operations segments 
the operating results for these segments are as follows year ended y ear ended in thousands december  decemb er  real hotel real hotel estate operations total estate op erations total revenues     mortgage interest expense depreciation expense    other operating expenses     operating income    real estate investment and management revenues from the real estate investment and management segment decreased  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily the result of a reduction in rental revenues resulting from certain mid year vacancies in the company s portfolio during mortgage interest expense continued to decrease as a result of continuing mortgage amortization 
such expense totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for  a decline of  or 
depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced depreciation expense associated with certain properties or improvements becoming fully depreciated in and  partially offset by depreciation from additions other operating expenses associated with the management of real properties increased  or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in this increase is primarily the result of real estate tax expense  property maintenance  and compensation expense 
hotel operations hotel operating revenues increased  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily as the result of improved lodging demand due to a stronger us economy and the acquisition of the connecticut hotel 
total operating expenses of the company s hotel segment increased  or to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the acquisition of the connecticut hotel 
engineered products the company s engineered products segment includes metex and afp transformers 
the operating results of the engineered products segment are as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   operating income   net sales of the engineered products segment decreased slightly for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  this is primarily due to decreased demand in the company s engineered and automotive product lines  partially offset by an increase in transformer products  which occurred in the first half of the decrease in the automotive product line is primarily a result of a softening of sales in the automotive industry 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased for the year ended december   compared to  primarily related to the shift in segment sales  as noted above  and increases in the cost of raw materials  primarily steel components 
in addition  the company incurred rework and nonconformance costs associated with a new product line  primarily during the first six months of selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segment remained relatively consistent  decreasing  or for the year ended december   compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses  and freight costs  partially offset by an increase in professional fees 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturing operations increased  or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in  primarily attributable to an increase in travel expenses  partially offset by a non recurring transaction  in other income and expense  net other income and expense  net decreased million from million in to million in the decrease is primarily due to the sale of the company s interest in prime hospitality corp 
which resulted in a gain of million in that year and is partially offset by gains on the sale of the company s interest in a joint venture which owns and operates a hotel located in quebec  canada  as well as the sale by a joint venture which owned and operated a hotel located in new jersey of its underlying assets in income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  reflects the benefits of the donation of certain properties to qualified charitable organizations in that year 
discontinued operations income from operations on properties sold or held for sale and accounted for as discontinued operations was  on a net of tax basis  for the year ended december   versus  for prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect results of operations of real properties held for sale as of december   or disposed of during and  as discontinued operations 
during  the company divested itself of four properties which had a net book value of million 
the aggregate proceeds from these transactions were million  resulting in a gain of million  on a net of tax basis 
during  the company divested itself of ten properties which had a net book value of million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions were million 
in addition  the company received an  purchase money mortgage in connection with the sale of one of these properties 
two of the properties disposed of were contributed to charitable organizations 
net gains on the disposal of real estate assets accounted for as discontinued operations were million  on a net of tax basis  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company experienced a net cash inflow from operations of approximately million  million and 
million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in operating cash flows from to principally results from a decrease in notes and accounts receivables  net million and increases in income taxes payable million  interest and dividend income million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities million 
cash flows provided by operating activities in exceeded by million 
additional interest and dividend income of million earned in is the primary cause of this increase 
the increase in interest rates and the company s increased holdings in dividend paying securities resulted in a increase in interest and dividend income over that earned in changes in operating assets and liabilities during consumed million in cash 
the most significant of which were income taxes million and notes and accounts receivable million 
the latter of which was caused by the delay in the receipt of a portion of the proceeds in connection with the sale of the company s interest in a joint venture which owns and operates a hotel located in quebec  canada  which was received in early net cash used in investing activities was million for versus net cash provided by investing activities of million in this change primarily results from the timing of the purchase or sale of available for sale securities million  lower distributions from joint ventures million which included sale proceeds and distributions related to the company s interest in certain hotel ventures  and the acquisition of additions to real estate assets million which included the may purchase of a commercial property located in long island city  new york for approximately million 
net cash provided by investing activities in was lower than that of by million 
the timing of certain events is the primary cause of this fluctuation 
proceeds from the sale of real estate assets were million lower in while cash used for the acquisition of real estate and other fixed assets was million higher in than the respective amounts in  including those accounted for as discontinued operations 
the increase in acquisition costs includes the purchase of the connecticut hotel in november  net of the related mortgage 
offsetting these reductions in cash flows from investing activities are million less in sale proceeds and distributions related to the company s interest in certain joint ventures and million in additional net proceeds from the available for sale security transactions in versus the respective amounts in during november  the company acquired the connecticut hotel for approximately million  including million which was allocated to furniture  fixtures and equipment 
the purchase was partially financed by an million mortgage which bears interest at per annum  is payable monthly based on a year amortization and matures in december the total cost of the acquisition  less the proceeds of the mortgage  is reflected in acquisition of additions to real estate assets in the consolidated statements of cash flows for net cash used in financing activities was approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the amount is primarily attributable to the january purchase and retirement of  shares of common stock for an aggregate price of million or per share related to a dutch auction self tender offer 
in addition  the company used cash for the purchase and retirement of an additional 
million and million of the company s common stock during and  respectively 
the company also used 
million  million and million of cash for principal payments on mortgage obligations  including those associated with discontinued operations  during  and  respectively 
these uses of cash were offset by proceeds from the exercises of stock options during  and of 
million  
million and 
million  respectively  and from tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options of 
million during previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and have also reduced retained earnings by amounts in excess of par value 
any future purchases in excess of par value will also reduce retained earnings 
repurchases of the company s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices and may be made in privately negotiated transactions  subject to available resources 
future proceeds from the issuance of common stock in excess of par value will be credited to retained earnings until such time that previously recorded reductions have been recovered 
at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was million  compared to cash and marketable securities of million and working capital of million at december  management continues to believe that the real estate market is overvalued and accordingly acquisitions have been limited to those select properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that the available working capital puts the company in an opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio  if and when attractive long term opportunities become available 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in to owned joint ventures in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
the debt of the joint venture in which the company currently has an ownership interest is a non recourse obligation and is collateralized by the entity s real property 
the company believes that the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
the company is not obligated for the debts of the joint venture  but could decide to satisfy them in order to protect its investment 
in such event  the company s capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of the company s investment and its results of operations would be negatively impacted 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoing operations or borrowings 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans may come from existing funds  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to the acquisition of other companies or the acquisition of real properties in exchange for equity or debt securities 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level of cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company and the increase in us interest rates  the company s earnings have been favorably impacted 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell common stock short or participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives are recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout the world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significant portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by the engineered products segment to general motors and autoliv  its largest customers  accounted for and of the segment s sales  respectively 
since our engineered products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  the loss of either of these customers would adversely affect the company s revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december   and   and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the us dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to its overall financial position 
since the euro has historically been relatively stable in relation to the us dollar  the company s results have not been significantly impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses in the past 
accordingly  the company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure 
if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine this practice to minimize the associated risks 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith 
see environmental regulations in item of part i and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this matter 
the company is subject to various other litigation  legal  regulatory and tax matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
when management believes it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and such amounts are reasonably estimable  the company provides for amounts that include judgments and penalties that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usually included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long term liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  depending on the anticipated payment date 
during  the company reversed million in long term and deferred income tax liabilities relating to certain tax matters for which the statue of limitations has expired 
none of the remaining matters are expected to result in a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations and other commitments at december  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations year years years year s total long term debt   interest on long term debt    operating leases  employment contract estimated environmental related costs   total contractual cash obligations     see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

related party transactions the company has a interest in an unconsolidated limited liability corporation  whose principal assets are two distribution centers leased to kmart 
a group that includes the wife of the company s board chairman  two directors of the company and the wife of one of the directors has an interest in this entity 
the company s share of income arising from this investment  accounted for as a leveraged lease  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of the estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accounting policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgments which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investment and management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenants under net leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
under this type of lease  the tenant is obligated to pay all operating costs of the property including real estate taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognized as earned and deemed collectible 
the effect of stepped rent increases on significant leases are recorded  net of allowances  on a straight line basis 
gains on sales of real estate assets and equity investments are recorded when the gain recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america have been met 
the company does not have leases that include significant rent concessions or provisions that require the lessee to fund capital improvements or to pay the lessor any revenues based upon indexes or rates that are not explicitly stated in the lease 
reimbursements of certain costs received from tenants are recognized as tenant reimbursement revenues 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage of tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease  net of the related deferred tax liability  in the years in which the net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rents  tenant escalations  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable hotel operations revenues from the company s hotel operations are generally recognized when earned 
hotel revenues primarily represent room rental and food and beverage sales and are recognized at the time of the hotel stay or sale of restaurant services 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts which include the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experience 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequate controls are in place to ensure compliance with contractual product specifications  a substantial history of such performance has been established and historical returns and allowances have not been significant 
if actual sales returns and allowances exceed historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections experience  current economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reassesses the appropriateness of such classification at each reporting date 
at december  and  all marketable securities held by the company have been classified as available for sale and  as a result  are stated at fair value  based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities  as determined on a first in  first out basis  are included in the consolidated statements of income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if it is believed that an other than temporary decline exists  the company will write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification of marketable securities  as well as its determination of whether an other than temporary decline in the value of its investments exists 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineering changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  seven to years for renovations and improvements and five to years for equipment and fixtures 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation is discontinued 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers 
upon disposition  the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
any gain or loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the normal course of business  the company receives offers for the sale of properties  either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer usually requires a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  management decides not to sell a property classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for rental or its fair market value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company adjust the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over the adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and net income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessments utilizing the provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to be disposed of should be reclassified as discontinued operations 
the company considers real property to be held for sale and reported as discontinued operations if management commits to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms and believes such sale will be completed within one year 
in such event  the financial results associated with these assets are reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
although operating income  income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations are directly affected by management s assessments  the reclassification has no impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asset over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted sfas no 
pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represent obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
these assumptions are used in actuarial calculations to estimate pension costs as well as pension assets or liabilities included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the company s pension costs and obligations 
the company has assumed the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be in each of the last three years 
based on the company s existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in net periodic pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic pension income expense 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have changed fiscal net periodic pension expense by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally in the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rate exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in both common and preferred equity issues 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level of cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company and the increase in us interest rates  the company s earnings have been favorably impacted 
the company s marketable securities consist of us investments in both common and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and self amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties 
the company s derivative instruments primarily consist of put and or call options 
such derivatives are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december   and   and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the us dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to its overall financial position 
since the euro has historically been relatively stable in relation to the us dollar  the company s results have not been significantly impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses in the past 
accordingly  the company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure 
if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine this practice to minimize the associated risks 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commodities principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metals purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact pricing
