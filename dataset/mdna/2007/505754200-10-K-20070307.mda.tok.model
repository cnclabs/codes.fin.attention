ladish was faced with a significant challenge in in integrating two newly acquired businesses  zaklad kuznia matrycowa zkm and valley machining  inc valley 
both of these acquisitions fit ladish s identified targets of building on its established business platforms in lower cost locations 
in  ladish assisted zkm in upgrading its production controls and installing a new operating system as zkm prepares to enter the european aerospace market to complement its existing industrial business 
at valley  ladish increased capacity and capabilities by adding four new machining centers and transferring two additional machining centers from the cudahy operation 
all of the key raw materials utilized by ladish were subject to significant price increases in for and beyond  ladish has taken steps to assure those escalating costs are passed through to its customers 
the increase in raw material pricing does have a negative impact on cost of goods as a percentage of sales and ladish has continued to focus on productivity improvements to offset that trend 
the increasing raw material pricing combined with the sales growth has caused a growth in working capital 
as of december   inventory was million  a million increase from the beginning of the year  and accounts receivable grew million by year end ladish funded this growth with cash generated from operations and its credit facility 
ladish generated million of pretax income in  a million increase over the company s tax rate for was for financial statement purposes

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company recognized million of net sales in fiscal  a improvement over the million of net sales in the net sales growth was due to a sales increase in jet engine components  a sales increase in aerospace components and a sales increase in general industrial components 
the net sales increase in general industrial components was largely attributed to a full year of sales from the company s polish subsidiary  zkm 
in  cost of sales was of net sales  a decrease from the level of in this improvement resulted in a gross profit margin in of in comparison to in the increase in profitability was due to more efficient operations at the company s facilities  higher incremental earnings from absorption of fixed costs and a strong market for by product materials 
the increase in profitability was partially offset by higher raw material prices which are passed directly to the customer without mark up and the addition of the zkm sales which carry lower profit margins than sales from domestic operations 
in  the company incurred million of sg a expense  or of net sales 
this sg a increase from of net sales in was the result of additional foreign sales which carry added costs  the oversight costs of the zkm operation and additional provisions for incentive compensation resulting from the company s improved profitability

in a further analysis of the year over year profitability  it should be noted that results benefited from a pension credit of approximately million in comparison to a credit of million in the pension credit or expense results from the method required by accounting rules for amortizing significant gains or losses related to pension fund assets and obligations occurring in prior years 
tax expense for was million for federal  state and foreign taxes reflecting an effective rate of in comparison to the million tax expense for the increase in the rate over the rate of is due primarily to increased income before taxes and a reduction of the extra territorial income eti exclusion credit relative to total tax expense associated with the company s foreign sales

purchase obligations other long term obligations pensions postretirement benefits the company expects to fund the payment of long term debt through the use of cash on hand  cash generated from operations  the reduction of working capital and  if necessary  through access to the facility 
the purchase obligations relate primarily to take or pay raw material purchase orders necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog for the company s products along with take or pay commitments for energy supplies also necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog 
there are no net settlement provisions under any of these purchase orders nor is there any market for the underlying materials 
the company s estimated cash pension contribution is based upon the calculation of the company s independent actuary for there are no calculations beyond the company s actual cash expenditures for postretirement benefits have only been projected out through the year critical accounting policies deferred income taxes the company has domestic net operating loss nol carryforwards that were generated prior to its reorganization pre reorganization completed on april  as well as nol carryforwards that were generated subsequent to reorganization and prior to the ownership change post reorganization  and nol carryforwards generated in through these nols are available to the company to reduce future taxable income 
the net realizable value of the related tax benefit of the nols is approximately million as of december  the amount of the nol carryforwards used through december  total million of the pre reorganization nols  million of the post reorganization nols and million of the nols generated in through federal nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of pre reorganization nols and million of nols generated in the post reorganization nols were fully utilized in wisconsin nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of nols generated in the company s ipo in march  created an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue service irs 
this ownership change generated an irs imposed limitation on the utilization of nol carryforwards  generated prior to the ownership change  to reduce future taxable income 
the annual use of the nol carryforwards is limited to the lesser of the company s taxable income or the amount of the irs imposed limitation 
since the ownership change  the total nol available for use is million annually 
to the extent less than million is used in any year  the unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
pre reorganization nols are further limited to an annual usage of million 
any unused amount is added to and increases the limitation in the succeeding year 
the pre reorganization nols of million expire in there is no limitation on the usage of the million of nols generated in and these nols expire in because of the annual limitations on the usage of pre reorganization nols and their earlier expiration dates  there is a greater risk of the loss of benefits recorded for these nols 
the net deferred tax asset recorded for the pre reorganization nols approximates million 
as of december  and  the company has approximately million of wisconsin tax credit carryforwards 
the company may be eligible to use the tax credit carryforwards over a fifteen year period beginning january  the state of wisconsin has not yet issued administrative rules regarding the future use of these tax credit carryforwards and as such  the company does not have a basis on which to determine that it is more likely than not that the tax credit carryforwards will be utilized 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  and  related to these tax credit carryforwards 
the company will continue to assess its ability to use the tax credit carryforwards in the future 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires establishment of a valuation allowance for all or a part of the nols unless it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize the nols before they expire 
in determining that realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not  the company gave consideration to a number of factors including its recent earnings history  expectations for earnings in the future  the timing of reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies available to the company and the expiration dates associated with nol carryforwards 
if  in the future  the company determines that it is no longer more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against all or part of the net deferred tax assets with an offsetting charge to the income tax provision 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans plans covering a number of its employees 
the company contributed million and million  respectively  to the plans in and the company intends to contribute million  million and million to the plans in  and  respectively 
the company plans on funding those contributions from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  working capital reductions  treasury stock contributions and  if necessary  from the facility 
no calculation has been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is on discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assumed an annual long term rate of return on plan assets of for both and for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on plan assets of 
the company is currently using a rate of for its discount rate assumption  an increase from the rate used for prior to this increase  the discount rate assumption had declined for five consecutive years 
a decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in an increase in the additional minimum pension liability included as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such a decrease also results in an actuarial loss which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
an increase in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
the company cannot predict the level of interest rates in the future and correspondingly cannot predict the future discount rate which will be applied to determine the company s projected benefit obligation 
as demonstrated in the chart below  relatively small movements in the discount rate  up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s projected benefit obligation under the plans 
projected plan benefit obligation as of december  dollars in millions at discount rate at discount rate at discount rate nor can the company predict with any certainty what the actual rate of return will be for the plans assets 
as demonstrated in the chart below  a modest change in the presumed rate of return on the plans assets will have a material impact upon the actual net periodic cost for the plans 
net periodic cost for year ending december  dollars in millions expected return expected return expected return goodwill goodwill of million  included in other assets on the company s balance sheets  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense 
the company s assessment of fair value takes into account a number of factors including ebitda multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
no impairments were recognized in or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  on october  because the company has no unvested options  adoption had no material effect on its financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  or fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that an entity recognize the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
an asset retirement obligation would be reasonably estimable if a it is evident that the fair value of the obligation is embodied in the acquisition price of the asset  b an active market exists for the transfer of the obligation  or c sufficient information exists to apply an expected present value technique 
fasb interpretation no 
became effective for calendar year enterprises as of december  in applying this statement to the company  it was necessary to determine if the company will undertake any major renovation  sell  dispose or abandon its factory and factory related assets  what liability would be associated with such action  and the date such action would be taken 
the company has four factories in the united states which may be subject to certain conditional retirement obligations 
the company believes it does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligation because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates has not been specified by others and information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
there are no plans to demolish or undertake any major renovation to the factories that would result in any retirement obligations 
the factories have been and are expected to be maintained by repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve activities resulting in a retirement obligation 
furthermore  there has not been any need identified for major renovations caused by technology changes  operational changes  or other factors 
fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be reflected as current period charges to expense and that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement became effective for inventory costs incurred by the company beginning january  as the company already applies this approach to inventory pricing  there was no effect on its financial position and results of operations for the year ended december  fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires public companies to recognize on their balance sheet the funded status of their defined benefit  pension and postretirement plans  as of december  as of that date  the company recognized actuarial gains and losses  prior service cost  and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as they relate to the plan s funded status 
the offset to this liability was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the million reduction in equity does not affect the company s ability to comply with debt covenant provisions 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 requires that an enterprise evaluate all tax positions recognized in that enterprise s financial statements for any uncertainty that the tax positions will not be sustained under examination 
the evaluation process is twofold 
first  an enterprise must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
secondly  the enterprise must measure the amount of benefit to recognize in its financial statements for tax positions which meet the more likely than not threshold 
fasb interpretation no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  therefore  this interpretation will be effective for the company for the year ending december  at this time  the company does not believe there is any uncertainty with respect to the tax positions reflected in its financial statements which would result in a material change in the amount of benefit recognized in the financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and trade accounts receivable is immaterial
