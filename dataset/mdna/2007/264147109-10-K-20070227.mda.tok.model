the company s mix of military  commercial and space business in  and  respectively  was approximately as follows military commercial space total the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and the apache helicopter programs 
sales to these programs  as a percentage of total sales  for  and  respectively  were approximately as follows boeing commercial aircraft boeing c aircraft boeing apache helicopter all others total the company s net income has fluctuated in recent years

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition except for the company s miltec subsidiary  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue from products sold under long term contracts is recognized by the company on the same basis as other sale transactions 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of services including prototype products by its miltec subsidiary based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue is recognized by miltec i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated periodically based on the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of customers and their payment history  historical write off experience and other assumptions 
the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to make estimates as to these and other factors on the ultimate realization of accounts receivable 
these estimates historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates were adjusted to actual amounts 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  comparable company analyses  and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in the event that a goodwill impairment charge is required  it would adversely affect the operating results and financial position of the company 
other intangible assets the company amortizes purchased other intangible assets with finite lives using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to fourteen years 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   the company began recognizing compensation expense for share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair value 
the expense is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the share based award  and is recognized over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based compensation based on the intrinsic value of options at the grant date 
the transition to fair value was accounted for using the modified prospective method 
therefore  financial statement amounts for prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of recognizing compensation cost relating to stock options 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage incurred  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it if necessary to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand and not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required
