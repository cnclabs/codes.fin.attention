item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of changes in current assets and current liabilities please refer to the discussion under the overview of this capital and liquidity section 
apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled billion  up from billion in the increase in cash flow was attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices 
the company s average realized oil and natural gas prices increased percent and percent  respectively  a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices 
higher production also added to our cash flow relative to  albeit to a much less extent 
these increases in cash flow were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices  costs related to hurricanes katrina and rita and an increase in exchange rates in canada 
historically  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices 
apache s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
debt we exited with a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately percent  compared to percent at the end of yearend outstanding current and long term debt totaled billion  billion higher than yearend the increase was associated with the issuance of commercial paper in conjunction with billion of acquisitions 
the company s outstanding debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in the years through approximately billion of our total debt is due in this debt consists of billion of commercial paper  that was subsequently reduced with billion of long term debt issued in january  and million of apache finance australia percent notes and various money market lines of credit in argentina and the us the billion of commercial paper is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities which expire in an additional million in debt matures in with the remaining billion maturing thereafter 
on january   the company issued million principal amount  million net of discount  of senior unsecured percent notes maturing january  the company also issued billion principal amount  million net of discount  of senior unsecured percent notes maturing january  the notes are redeemable  as a whole or in part  at apache s option  subject to a make whole premium 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the company s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 
please refer to note debt  subsequent debt of item in this form k 
in may  the company amended its existing five year revolving us credit facility which was scheduled to mature on may  the amendment a extended the maturity to may   b increased the size of the facility from million to billion  and c reduced the facility fees from 
percent to 
percent and reduced the margin over libor on loans from 
percent to 
percent 
the lenders also extended the maturity dates of the million canadian facility  the million australian facility and million of the million us credit facility  for an additional year to may  from may  the company also increased commercial paper availability to billion from billion 
by yearend  the company extended the maturity of another million of commitments under the million us credit facility for an additional year 
as a result  million will mature on may   and million will mature on may  the financial covenants of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than percent at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the negative covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to create liens and security interests on our assets  with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry  purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law  such as tax and mechanics liens 
the company may incur liens on assets located in the us  canada and australia of up to five percent of the company s consolidated assets 
there are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the us  canada and australia 
there are also restrictions on apache s ability to merge with another entity  unless the company is the surviving entity  and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group 
there are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes mac clauses 
the credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings 
however  the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if apache corporation  or any of its us  canadian and australian subsidiaries  defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of million or has any unpaid  non appealable judgment against it in excess of million 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of december  stock transactions on april   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock representing a market value of approximately billion on the date of announcement 
the company may buy shares from time to time on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  or a combination of both 
the timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of apache s management 
the company initiated the purchase program on may   after the company s first quarter earnings information was disseminated in the market 
through december   the company purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
oil and gas capital expenditures the company funded its exploration and development e d capital expenditures  gathering  transportation and marketing gtm investments  capitalized interest and asset retirement costs of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively  primarily with internally generated cash flow of billion  billion and billion 
the company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowings under the company s lines of credit and commercial paper program and  from time to time  issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions 
during and  the company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program  which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow 
in  the company primarily used its commercial paper program to fund its significant acquisitions 
the commercial paper was subsequently repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of billion of senior unsecured notes in january the following table presents a summary of the company s capital expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years 
year ended december  in thousands exploration and development united states canada egypt australia north sea argentina other international capitalized interest gathering transmission and processing facilities asset retirement costs arc arc acquired acquisitions oil and gas properties gas gathering  transmission and processing facilities capital expenditures  excluding arc  totaled billion in  up percent or billion from driven by an increase in acquisition activity 
the company invested billion on exploration and development activities in up nine percent from including drilling  wells 
in the us  we invested billion on exploration and development activities 
our gulf coast region invested approximately billion on drilling  recompletions  and platform and production support facilities  including million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital in excess of insurance coverage 
the region drilled wells in the gulf of mexico and wells onshore  with a percent success rate  despite ongoing hurricane repair activity 
the central region had its most active year ever investing million including the drilling of wells with a percent success rate 
the region added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with the addition of amerada hess s permian basin properties in texas and new mexico at the beginning of and will do so again with the close of the acquisition of additional permian basin properties from anadarko in the first quarter of canada s drilling program accounted for more than half of the company s wells drilled 
the region invested billion in on exploration and development activities and drilled wells with an percent success rate 
twenty five percent of those wells were on the undeveloped acreage apache obtained through farm in agreements with exxonmobil 
we invested million in the north sea  million of which was on facility upgrades intended to improve the operating efficiency and drilling capability in the forties field 
four of the five exploration and development wells drilled during were productive 
we completed the forties power generation and gas ring in  which reduced fuel oil generating costs and improved production reliability 
we also started the upgrade of our produced water re injection system  upgraded the primary gas lift compression system and replaced instrumentation and control systems on several platforms 
at the end of  we were in the process of upgrading drilling equipment on all existing forties platforms that will extend the reach of our drilling equipment  allowing us to determine if the bounds of the forties field can be extended to the west 
the latter project should be completed by the end of the first quarter of egypt had another active and successful exploration and development program investing million and drilling wells of which percent were productive as we continued development of the qasr field 
in australia  we invested million in exploration and development activities as we participated in drilling wells  exploration wells and five development wells 
four of the exploration wells and three of the development wells were productive for a success rate of percent 
our exploration and development activities in argentina increased by million over as we invested million drilling wells  exploratory and development  with a success rate 
the company invested million in gathering  transmission and processing facilities in compared to million in in canada we invested million in processing plants  million of which was to construct five additional gas processing plants to support production from wells drilled on the acreage we earned from exxonmobil 
egypt invested million to complete the tarek gas plant pipeline inter connect and on expansion of gas processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity bottleneck throttling deliverability 
in we also recorded million in asset retirement costs 
the gulf coast region recorded an additional million to reflect the estimated abandonment costs to be incurred resulting from the hurricane activity  in addition to the approximately million recorded in this cost to abandon the operated and non operated platforms lost or severely damaged during the storms is expected to be incurred by the end of see note  asset retirement obligations of item in this form k 
we also recorded million in asset retirement costs associated with our acquisition activity 
on the acquisition front we invested a record billion in  closing four significant transactions  one in the gulf of mexico  one in west texas and two in argentina 
acquisition activity fluctuates from year to year based on the availability of acquisition opportunities that fit the company s strategy 
in  the company had its most active drilling year ever  drilling  wells investing billion on exploration and development activities  a percent increase from approximately two thirds of our exploration and development expenditures were invested in canada and the us  where nearly percent of apache s year end estimated proved reserves were located 
exploration and development expenditures in for canada and the us increased percent and percent  respectively  over canada was our most active region  drilling  wells  percent of which were shallow development wells 
canada was also very active in the undeveloped acreage apache obtained through two farm in agreements with exxonmobil 
the central region was the second most active region  drilling wells  with a percent success rate 
in the gulf coast region  despite the disruptions caused by the gulf of mexico hurricanes  we drilled wells  including offshore 
seventy seven percent of our gulf coast wells were productive 
in the north sea  we drilled a total of wells  including forties field wells  and invested approximately million of maintenance capital to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the forties field 
in egypt  we drilled wells of which percent were productive 
we continued development of the qasr field  where gross production averaged mmcf d in december in australia  we participated in drilling wells  exploration wells and development wells 
china s capital expenditures were flat compared to as they continued their development drilling program 
in apache also invested million in gathering  transmission and processing facilities investing million constructing gas processing plants in canada  six of which were completed by yearend  million in egypt developing qasr field facilities and million on facility upgrades in australia 
we incurred million in asset retirement costs in  most of which was attributed to the hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico escalating our abandonment obligations 
the company spent million on acquisitions in compared to billion in  as the high price commodity market in limited the number of attractive acquisition opportunities 
those that were pursued closed in the first quarter of acquisition expenditures typically vary year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit apache s overall strategy 
for  we plan another active year of drilling 
because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions  year to year results and the relative levels of commodity prices and service costs  accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best 
at the end of we had a fairly active drilling program underway  however  if commodity prices soften and service costs do not decline accordingly  apache will not hesitate to reduce activity until margins are back in line 
our preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines is approximately billion 
we generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable 
we continually look for properties in which we believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise 
cash dividend payments the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
the company increased its quarterly cash dividend percent  to cents per share from cents per share  effective with the november dividend payment 
during and  apache paid a total of million in dividends each year on its series b preferred stock issued in august see note  capital stock of item in this form k 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
contractual obligations we are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations 
these contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further information regarding these obligations 
note contractual obligations reference total thereafter in thousands debt note    operating leases and other commitments note     international lease commitments note     other international purchase commitments note    operating costs associated with pre existing volumetric production payments on acquired properties note    total contractual obligations a b a this table does not include the estimated liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of billion 
the company records a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation 
see note  asset retirement obligation of item in this form k for further discussion 
b this table does not include the company s pension or postretirement benefit obligations 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further discussion 
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur 
the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement  which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity 
such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation 
apache s management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately million for environmental remediation and approximately million for various legal liabilities  in addition to the million  plus interest  we accrued for the texaco china bv litigation 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s environmental and legal contingencies 
the company accrued approximately million as of december   for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with oil insurance limited oil 
apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property  pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the company 
as part of its membership  the company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from oil 
apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool  however  the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required 
as discussed under note  acquisitions and divestitures of item in this form k  apache assumed obligations for pre existing volumetric production payments vpps in the acquisition of properties from anadarko and the acquisition of properties from shell 
under the terms of the vpp agreements  apache is scheduled to deliver a total of mmboe in and mmboe in to morgan stanley as owner of the vpp interests 
morgan stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each vpp in any given month to satisfy the vpp interests 
however  they have no right to look to other assets or production of apache beyond that encumbered in the acquisition 
apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the vpps 
as of december   apache has booked a total of mmboe of reserves attributable to the anadarko and shell transactions 
the vpps are non operating interests  free of costs incurred for operations and production 
apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table 
upon closing of our acquisition of the north sea properties  apache assumed bp s abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price 
the purchase of the properties  however  did not relieve bp of its liabilities if apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation 
although not currently required  to ensure apache s payment of these costs  apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to bp if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both moody s and standard and poor s from the company s current ratings of a and a  respectively 
any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the north sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change 
if apache is required to provide a letter of credit  it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level 
the letter of credit amount would be million british pounds  an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through march  and will be negotiated annually based on apache s future abandonment obligation estimates 
the company s future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s 
the company s credit facilities do not require the company to maintain a minimum credit rating 
the negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under capital resources and liquidity  debt in this section of this form k 
in addition  generally under our commodity hedge agreements  apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the company s credit ratings decline significantly 
off balance sheet arrangements apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions 
apache entered into a partnership with exxonmobil to obtain additional interests in specific west texas and new mexico oil and gas properties acquired from exxonmobil in september apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and  therefore  proportionately consolidated only the company s portion of the oil and gas properties 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting 
reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method  which excludes the host country s share of reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
as such  our reserve engineers review and revise the company s reserve estimates at least annually 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
during  and  their review covered  and percent of the reserve value  respectively 
costs excluded under the full cost method of accounting  oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the company s accounting  exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
if geological and geophysical g g costs cannot be associated with specific properties  they are included in the amortization base as incurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play 
this evaluation considers among other factors  seismic data  requirements to relinquish acreage  drilling results  remaining time in the commitment period  remaining capital plans  and political  economic  and market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve on a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated 
beginning in  we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from egpc for our egyptian oil and gas sales 
deteriorating economic conditions in egypt lessened the availability of us dollars  resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from egpc 
during  we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts 
we have not established a reserve for these egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid  albeit late  and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable 
asset retirement obligation the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
apache s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries 
as a result  we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company regularly assesses and  if required  establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates 
tax reserves have been established  and include any related interest  despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the company s tax returns 
these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits  case law and any new legislation 
the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 
derivatives apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility 
the company accounts for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the estimated fair values of apache s derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
for foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs 
sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income  rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled 
realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in other under revenues and other of the statement of consolidated operations 
the fair value estimate of apache s derivative contracts requires judgment  however  the company s derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets 
as such  the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data 
option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  commodity risk in this form k for commodity price sensitivity information and the company s policies related to the use of derivatives 
stock based compensation consistent with the company s desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock based compensation on the income statement  apache early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment upon the fasb s issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter stock based compensation awards that vest during the year are reflected in the company s net income 
awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period 
the company chose to adopt the statement under the modified retrospective approach as prescribed under sfas no 
r 
under this approach  the company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant 
had the company not early adopted sfas no 
r under this transition approach  net income would have been lower by million million after tax or 
per diluted share 
normally  net income would be negatively impacted by adopting sfas no 
r under this transition method 
however  the company s share appreciation plan  which triggered in  has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
r that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of apb opinion no 
please refer to note  capital stock of item of this form k for a detailed description of the share appreciation plan and costs associated with our stock compensation plans 
also  inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under sfas no 
r are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as the company s expected stock price volatility  expected term of the employee option  expected dividend yield  the expected risk free interest rate  the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant 
for option valuations  apache utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
for valuing the share appreciation plan awards  the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation model developed by a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our united states and canadian natural gas production 
prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable 
monthly average oil price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during average gas price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
based on the company s worldwide oil and gas production levels  a per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by million and a 
per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by million 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the securities exchange commission sec 
under these rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes do not exceed the ceiling 
this ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  the excess is charged to additional dd a expense 
the calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities  however  as discussed above  sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions  however  in  the company s board of directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production generated from the company s drilling program 
in  financial derivative hedges represented approximately eight percent of the total worldwide natural gas and nine percent of the total worldwide crude oil production 
at year end  hedges in place were primarily related to north america production and represent approximately percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil 
on december   the company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million  while a percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately million 
the company also had open crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million  while a percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately million 
these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  see note  hedging and derivative instruments of item in this form k for notional volumes and terms associated with the company s derivative contracts 
apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy 
the risk management committee  comprising the chief financial officer  controller  treasurer and other key members of apache s management  approve and oversee these controls  which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department 
the treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities 
controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit  limits on volume  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
governmental risk apache s us and international operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations impacting production levels  taxes  environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential windfall profits tax 
weather and climate risk demand for oil and natural gas are  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 
while our planning for normal climatic variation  insurance program  and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather  not all such effects can be predicted  eliminated or insured against 
in response to large underwriting losses caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  the insurance industry has reduced capacity for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates 
as a result  there is no assurance that apache will be able to arrange insurance to cover fully its gulf of mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the current policies expire 
foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
in australia  oil production is sold under us dollar contracts and gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts 
over half the costs incurred for australian operations are paid in australian dollars 
in canada  the majority of oil and gas production is sold under canadian dollar contracts 
the majority of the costs incurred are paid in canadian dollars 
the north sea production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in british pounds 
in contrast  all oil and gas production in egypt is sold for us dollars and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in us dollars 
argentina revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in us dollars but translated into pesos at the then current exchange rate 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds  egyptian pounds or argentine pesos are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the australian dollar  canadian dollar  british pound  egyptian pound  or argentine peso as of december   would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain of approximately million 
interest rate risk on december   the company s debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately percent of total debt 
as a result  the interest expense on approximately percent of apache s debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
a percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately million 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  capital expenditure projections  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
