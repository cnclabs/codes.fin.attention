item a 
risk factors set forth below are various risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise adversely affect its business 
economic downturns and reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on the company s business 
significant portions of its revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by the government 
the company s ability to obtain future government work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid  which is largely a function of the level of government funding available 
the availability of government funding also affects the long term contracts we currently have as the contacts are based on options that the government could choose not to exercise if funding is cut back or not available at all 
the availability of funding could also affect whether or not those long term government contracts are renewed 
the company also performs commercial work for customers in the private sector 
the availability of this private sector work can be significantly adversely affected by general economic downturns and by fluctuations in specific customers economic circumstances 
the company s cost type government contracts provide the government with the option to have todd perform repair  maintenance and overhaul activities on certain government ships  and in some cases at certain government facilities 
while work on these ships is typically done at reasonably predictable intervals  those intervals can be substantially altered as a result of changing military priorities and other unexpected deployments 
furthermore  a decision by the government to redeploy these ships to another permanent geographic location could have a negative impact on the company s business depending on that location 
additionally  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to win renewal of any of its cost type government contracts 
even in the absence of geographic reassignment or other necessity  the government remains free to elect to have work done by other parties that is contemplated to be done under its contracts with todd 
the company s fixed price contracts subject it to the risk of increased project cost 
the profitability of its fixed price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause its actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of the original bid 
even in situations in which some of such increased costs arise as a result of customer initiated or approved change orders  there may be a delay or dispute as to the amount of increased revenue due to the company 
accounting for the company s revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation item  accounting for contract related revenues and costs as well as other cost items requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although the company believes it has sufficient experience and processes to enable it to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reliable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and the results of operations 
on a regular basis  the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulati ons 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the government has the ability to recover or disallow any costs which are improperly charged against or allocated to the contracts 
the company s future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment its longer term contracts 
the variables affecting the company s business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  domestic and foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the navy and other customers  competitors pricing behavior  and company labor efficiencies  work practices and estimating abilities 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing serviceability of the company s owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company continues to respond aggressively to the increasingly competitive shipbuilding and repair industry 
in addition to management s focus on the profitability of existing shipyard operations through reduced operating costs  improved production efficiencies  increased customer service and the pursuit of new business volume  management continues to evaluate options for deployment of assets with a view to improving the company s return on investment 
weather conditions can significantly impact the company s quarterly revenues and profitability 
the company s ability to perform work can be significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease profitability 
the company s long term success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
an important factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is also our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the personnel resources available in our geographic area and general economic conditions  as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment 
the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in the company s ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
as more fully described under regulatory matters above  the company is subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and workplace safety  the noncompliance with which can result in substantial penalties as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect operations in the future 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at its seattle shipyard and at closed former company facilities 
the company is currently defending approximately such claims  of which are considered significant 
the company has insurance agreements in place to cover these potential liabilities but a portion of that coverage  based on historical data  is expected to be exhausted in approximately three years 
the continued defense and settlement of these claims  after exhaustion of one of the insuring agreements  could have a significant impact on the company s profitability 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on operations and results 
the company is party to a collective bargaining agreement covering a substantial portion of its craft workforce 
although the company s results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the recent past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on operations and results if they were to occur in the future 
the company uses certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate the company s equipment 
steel and other commodities are used in company projects and they can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
the company has not been significantly adversely affected by commodity price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that it will not be in the future 
failure of its subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on the company s results 
the company subcontracts portions of many of its contracts to specialty subcontractors but it remains ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although the company attempts to obtain bonding or other forms of guarantees  it is not always successful in obtaining bonds or guarantees from certain subcontractors 
accordingly  there is no guarantee that the company will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that the company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the company 
should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

the company believes that its owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although from time to time the company has been required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of certain owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company removed a segment of its pier as part of the remedial action on the harbor island superfund site see below and has determined that replacement of that pier segment is not necessary for the continued operation of the shipyard 
several older piers have a continued life expectancy of approximately fifteen years 
decisions regarding the replacement of those piers will be made at a time closer to the end of the affected pier s useful life 
during fiscal years and  the company spent approximately million and million  respectively  on shipyard capital expenditures

during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company began discussions with the natural resource trustees trustees for the harbor island superfund site site and continued these discussions during the remainder of fiscal year the company anticipates that the trustees will file a claim against the company at some future date alleging damages to the natural resources at the site caused by the release of hazardous substances 
the best estimate of a potential natural resource damage claim has been included in the environmental reserve 
the payment of any eventual claim is covered by the aforementioned insurance policy  except for the policy deductible  provided that aggregate policy limits have not been exceeded 
the amount of the policy deductible payment is reflected in the company s environmental reserve at apr il  other environmental remediation matters the company was notified in november regarding the discovery of sub surface oil on the property formerly owned by the company in galveston  texas 
the subject property was sold by the company to the port of galveston in and there have been several intervening owners and operators at the site since the company is investigating the factual allegations and any potential liability

the company has included an estimate of the potential liability for this site in its environmental reserve 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was notified by the epa that it is a potentially responsible party prp at the malone service company superfund site malone in galveston county  texas 
the epa alleges that the company s galveston shipyard  which ceased operations in  was the generator of waste materials that were delivered  through independent transport companies  to the malone site 
the epa has further indicated that the company will  based on volumes of material at the site believed to have been generated by the company  be eligible to participate in a de minimus settlement for small contributors 
the company has included its best estimate of the settlement amount in its environmental reserve 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company  along with other companies and organizations  was notified that it is a potentially responsible party at the bkk landfill facility in west covina  california

it is alleged that the company s san pedro shipyard closed in caused shipyard waste to be sent to the bkk facility during the s and s 
due to the uncertainties at this time the company has not established a reserve for this issue 
asbestos related claims and insurance the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at its seattle shipyard and closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of april  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately cases do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately cases assert on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases seek compensatory damages of less than million per claim 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
bodily injury reserves declined from million at april  to million at april  bodily injury insurance receivables also decreased from million at april  to million at april  these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from expo sure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgment of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as further discussed below  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at april   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respe ctively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
the following chart indicates the number of claims filed and resolved in the past two fiscal years  including the number of claims yet to be resolved at the end of each fiscal year 
resolution includes settlements  adjudications and dismissals 
the claims are further categorized as either malignant or non malignant

due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and un filed claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity

during the first half of fiscal year  the company recorded million  or of its full year revenue 
revenues in the second half of the year were higher than the first half due to higher volumes of both cost type and fixed price work in the second half versus the first half of the year 
revenues for the third and fourth quarters of the year were million 
work volumes in the second half of the fiscal year increased due to work on the aircraft carrier uss lincoln  excavator barge  m v malaspina  usns salvor and healy 
for the full year ended april   the company recorded revenue of million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from fiscal year revenue of million 
the majority of the company s navy and coast guard work volumes  as measured by direct labor hours and revenue  are associated with short term less than six months vessel availabilities executed under multi year option contracts 
in the prior year  fiscal  revenues were favorably impacted by work volumes on contracts that were largely completed in that year 
fiscal volumes included overhaul work on the aircraft carrier uss stennis  post shakedown availability work on the destroyer uss momsen as a subcontractor to bath iron works  several planned maintenance availabilities for us coast guard polar icebreakers  dry docking of the frigate uss ford and work as a subcontractor to electric boat 
the year on year revenue decrease from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to lowe r volumes on all navy and coast guard cost type contracts  the conclusion of work on the uss momsen in the prior year  and less subcontract work for electric boat 
these year on year volumes reductions more than offset year on year volume increases on fixed price ship repair and new construction contracts for commercial and government customers 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported operating income of million  which was million or less than operating income for the fiscal year ended april  of million 
the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in navy and coast guard work volumes  as well as decreased profitability on fixed price work 
this profit reduction is due to challenges arising from the complexity of several conversions and large repairs being performed simultaneously 
operating income by contract type cost plus contracts during fiscal year the company experienced lower work volumes related to cost plus contracts as compared to the company s direct labor hours decreased approximately percent from on cost plus contracts 
this is primarily attributable to a decrease in work under the company s uscg polar and navy cvn contracts 
operating income attributable to cost plus contracts increased from fiscal year to fiscal year due to higher overhead reimbursement rates which affect cost plus revenues 
fixed price contracts work volumes on fixed price contracts  as measured by direct labor hours  was higher in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased ship repair and new construction volumes on a range of projects  including the noaa okeanos explorer  excavator barge  m v malaspina and uscg healy 
however  in spite of the year on year increase in volumes  operating income on fixed price projects decreased from to due to the complexity of several conversions and large repairs being performed simultaneously 
time and materials contracts the company had an approximate decrease in the volume of work completed under time and materials contracts in fiscal year compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of work completed under the electric boat contract  the majority of which was completed in fiscal year and the early stages of operating margins on time and materials contracts remained approximately unchanged from fiscal year to fiscal year consolidated operating results

the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from fiscal year reported revenue of million 
the increase in total revenues is primarily due to increases in revenues from work completed under the cvn  coast guard and electric boat contracts  offset by a decrease in revenues from the aoe contract 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year decreased by million  or approximately  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in volumes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in is primarily attributable to higher overhead reimbursement rates which affect revenues on cost plus work 
cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately  from fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in is primarily attributable to lower margins on cost type work due to increases in direct materials and subcontractor costs  lower overhead expense recovery and reduced fees on cost type work  all expressed as a percentage of revenue 
the impact of these changes is pronounced because of the significant amount of cost type work performed during the year 
administrative and manufacturing overhead overhead costs for administrative and manufacturing activities decreased by million  or  from fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was approximately and  respectively  for fiscal years and the decrease in administrative and manufacturing overhead costs is primarily attributable to volume decreases from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in administrative and manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by the fact that a significant portion of these costs are fixed 
overhead costs for administrative and manufacturing activities increased by million  or  from fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead  as a percentage of revenue  were approximately and for and  respectively 
the decrease in administrative and manufacturing overhead costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in volumes during fiscal investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year increased by million  or approximately  when compared to fiscal year the increase in investment and other income reported during fiscal year is due primarily to the lease of certain facilities and provision of related services to kiewit general in connection with the construction of the hood canal floating bridge

the company generated more cash from operations in compared to  which resulted in more interest earned for gain loss on sale of available for sale securities during fiscal year  the company reported a net gain of million on the sale of available for sale securities 
the increase in gains from to was primarily due to the sale of securities to pay the extraordinary cash dividend of million on june  during fiscal year  the company reported a net loss of million on the sale of available for sale securities 
the increase in losses from to is due to a recognized pre tax charge of million for year ended april   attributable to the impairment of publicly traded debt securities 
the impairment charges were assessed by management as other than temporary as these securities were being considered for sale at a loss in order to fund the payment of an extraordinary cash dividend that was approved by the board of directors on march  as such  at april   the company no longer had the intent and ability to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery 
because management intended to sell these securities  the company recognized this loss in the income statement under loss on available for sale securities and adjusted the cost basis of the respective securities down to their estimated fair value as the new cost basis

this represents a decrease of million in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and were and respectively 
in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million  an increase of million in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year to is attributable to the fiscal year reduction of the deferred tax rate from to  the fiscal year reduction in current tax liability  and the fiscal year adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities balances 
backlog at april  the company s backlog consisted of approximately million of ship repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at april  and april   respectively 
the company s backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s navy and coast guard phased maintenance contracts are at the option of the navy and the coast guard  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options have been exercised by these customers 
environmental matters and other contingencies the company has provided total aggregate reserves of million as of april  for its contingent environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
due to the complexities and extensive history of the company s environmental and bodily injury matters  the amounts and timing of future expenditures is uncertain 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these environmental and bodily injury matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage of the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit ratings of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both parties will be able to perform under their respective policy or agreement 
as of april   the company has recorded an insurance receivable of million to reflect the contractual arrangements with the insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental and other matters 
included in the reserves are estimated final sediment remediation costs for harbor island of million that are expected to occur within the next years after certain piers reach the end of their useful lives 
these costs are reflected in the company s balance sheet under environmental and other reserves 
similarly  the insurance receivable of million relating to these reserves is reflected in the company s balance sheet under insurance receivable 
the company continues to negotiate with its insurance carriers and certain prior landowners and operators for past and future remediation costs 
the company has not recorded any receivables for any amounts that may be recoverable from such negotiations or other claims 
ongoing operations recurring costs associated with the company s environmental compliance program are expensed as incurred 
recent capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance include the multi year development of a storm water system for approximately million 
past activities environmental the company faces significant potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard the harbor island site and at several sites allegedly used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at company facilities 
information with respect to these contingencies and claims is provided in item in this report 
the company s policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
the company s estimates of its liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
the company does not discount these liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount greater than the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
in fiscal year  the company spent million for environmental site remediation 
all of these costs are reimbursable to the company through its insurance coverage 
an additional million in environmental site remediation was spent by third party vendors under the direction of the company s management 
these costs were paid directly to the third party vendors under the company s insurance policies 
most of these expenditures were related to the harbor island site 
the company spent approximately million on environmental site remediation in fiscal year all of these costs were reimbursed to the company through its insurance coverage 
an additional million in environmental site remediation was spent in fiscal year by third party vendors under the direction of the company s management 
these costs were paid directly to the third party vendors under the company s insurance policies 
most of these expenditures were related to the harbor island site 
actual costs to address the harbor island site and other environmental sites and matters will depend upon numerous factors  including the number of parties found liable at each environmental site  the method of remediation  outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcome of litigation  technological developments and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
the company entered into a consent decree with the epa during the fourth quarter of fiscal year with respect to its harbor island site and  as a result  the company increased its harbor island site reserves by an additional million 
the company was notified in november regarding the discovery of sub surface oil on the property formerly owned by the company in galveston  texas 
the subject property was sold by the company to the port of galveston in and there have been several intervening owners and operators at the site since the company is investigating the factual allegations and any potential liability 
due to the uncertainties at this time the company has not established a reserve 
past activities asbestos and related claims the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at its seattle shipyard and closed former company facilities 
the cases generally include as defendants  in addition to the company  other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all other claims of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of april  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against the company 
the previously stated claimants is the company s best estimate taking known facts into consideration 
approximately cases do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately cases assert on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases seek compensatory damages of less than million per claim 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants which claims are made or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  the company has not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
bodily injury reserves declined from million at april  to million at april  bodily injury insurance receivables also decreased from million at april  to million at april  these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from expo sure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgment of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as further discussed below  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at april   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respe ctively 
the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity 
other reserves during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a reserve of million related to the unanticipated bankruptcy of one of its previous insurance carriers 
the reserve  which reflects the company s best estimate of the known liabilities associated with unpaid workers compensation claims arising from the two year coverage period commencing october   is subject to change as additional facts are uncovered 
these claims have reverted to the company due to the liquidation of the insurance carrier 
although the company expects to recover at least a portion of these costs from the liquidation and other sources  the amount and the timing of any such recovery cannot be estimated currently and therefore no estimate of amounts recoverable is included in the current financial results 
since establishing the reserve  the company has paid approximately million  million and million in claims in fiscal years  and  respectively  which have been charged against the reserve

a change in the composition or timing of projected work could cause planned capital expenditures and shipyard repair and maintenance expenditures to change 
in the long term  the company s liquidity could be impacted by default of its insurers on environmental or bodily injury claims 
the company however anticipates that it will meet its long term liquidity needs due to its available cash reserves  ability to generate profits and lack of debt 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended april  this reflects a decrease of million or approximately from net cash provide by operating activities in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in customer cash receipts in compared to as seen from the cash collections on the statement of cash flows 
decreases in cash receipts from to are driven by timing differences  from when the customer is invoiced and when the cash is collected  and by work volumes and revenue  with work volumes and revenue being down from to net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended april  this is an increase of million or approximately from net cash provided by operating activities in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in customer cash receipts in compared to investing cash flows for the year ended april  investing activities produced million in cash  primarily due to the sale of million of marketable securities and the maturity of million of marketable securities
