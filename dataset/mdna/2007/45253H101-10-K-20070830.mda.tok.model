item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of targeted antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
the combination of our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology has resulted in the development of both proprietary product candidates and technologies 
our tumor activated prodrug  or tap  technology relates to the attachment of one of our proprietary  extremely potent small molecule cytotoxic  or cell killing  agents to monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to cancer cells 
the antibody serves to target the cytotoxic agent specifically to cancer cells and the cytotoxic agent serves to kill the cells 
our tap technology is designed to selectively kill cancer cells with limited damage to healthy tissue 
all of our and our collaborative partners tap compounds currently in preclinical and clinical testing by us or our collaborative partners contain either dm or dm as the cytotoxic agent 
both dm and dm are our proprietary derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology to develop naked  or unconjugated  antibody anticancer product candidates 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates containing their antibodies 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are generally entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in addition  under certain agreements we are entitled to research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner s request 
we are reimbursed our direct and overhead costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and  under certain collaborative agreements  the reimbursement includes a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include amgen  inc formerly abgenix  inc  biogen idec  biotest ag  centocor  inc 
a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  genentech  inc  and sanofi aventis 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
in july  we entered into a discovery  development and commercialization collaboration with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc now sanofi aventis 
under the terms of this agreement  in consideration of an upfront payment of million  sanofi aventis gained commercialization rights to three of the then most advanced product candidates in our preclinical pipeline and the commercialization rights to certain new product candidates developed within the collaboration during its research program term 
under the terms of the agreement  we also are entitled to receive committed research funding totaling not less than million over the full five years of the research collaboration  which includes the initial three year term of the research program ending august  plus the two month extensions beginning september  through the end of fiscal  we have earned million of committed research funding for activities performed under the agreement  of which million  million  and million was recognized during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of june   we have million of committed research funding remaining under this arrangement 
the collaboration agreement also provides for certain other payments based on the achievement of product candidate milestones and royalties on sales of any resulting products  if and when such sales commence 
assuming all benchmarks are met  we will receive payments of between million and million per antigen target 
through the end of fiscal  we have earned million of the potential million with the achievement of various milestones 
additionally  in october  sanofi aventis licensed non exclusive rights to use our proprietary resurfacing technology to humanize antibodies 
this license term ends on august  with the right to extend for one or more additional periods of three years each by providing us with written notice prior to expiration of the then current license term 
under the terms of the license  we are due a million license fee  half of which was paid upon contract signing and the second half is due on august   and in addition  we are entitled to receive milestone payments potentially totaling million plus royalties on sales for each compound humanized under this agreement 
we have deferred the  portion of the upfront payment we have already received and are recognizing this amount as revenue over the estimated period of substantial involvement 
in december  sanofi aventis entered into an option agreement with us that enables them to gain expanded access to our tap technology 
the option agreement provides sanofi aventis with the right to enter into a multi target agreement with us prior to or on august  by payment of an agreed upon option exercise fee 
the multi target agreement would allow sanofi aventis to evaluate our tap technology with antibodies to targets not included in the existing research collaboration between the companies with certain restrictions and to license the right to use the technology to develop products for such targets on agreed upon terms 
we received payment of  with the signing of this option agreement  which we have deferred and are recognizing over the option period 
in may  we entered into a license agreement with genentech that granted genentech exclusive rights to use our tap technology with antibodies to her we received a million upfront payment upon execution of the agreement 
in addition to royalties on net sales if and when they occur  the terms of the agreement include other payments based upon genentech s achievement of milestones 
in may  we amended this agreement which increased the potential milestone payments and royalties 
assuming all benchmarks are met under this agreement  we will receive million in milestone payments under this agreement 
in january  genentech notified us that the ind application for trastuzumab dm application submitted by genentech to the fda had become effective 
under the terms of this agreement  this event triggered a million milestone payment to us 
in july  genentech began phase ii evaluation of trastuzumab dm and we earned a million milestone payment with this event 
in july  we entered into a development and license agreement with biotest ag 
the agreement grants biotest ag exclusive rights to use our tap technology with antibodies that target a specific receptor to create anticancer therapeutics 
under the agreement  we received a million upfront payment upon execution of the agreement  and could potentially receive up to million in milestone payments  and royalties on the sales of any resulting products 
we will receive manufacturing payments for any preclinical and clinical materials made at the request of biotest 
the agreement also provides us with the right to elect to participate  at specific stages during the clinical evaluation of any compound created under this agreement  in the us development and commercialization of that compound in lieu of receiving royalties on us sales of that product and the milestone payments not yet earned 
we can exercise this right by making a payment to biotest of an agreed upon fee of million or million  depending on the stage of development 
upon exercise of this right  we would share equally with biotest the associated costs of product development and commercialization in the us along with the profit  if any  from us product sales 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate that we will have a commercially approved product within the near future 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly in the near term as we continue our development efforts  including an expanded clinical trial program and development of commercial scale production capabilities at third party suppliers 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities from million in cash and marketable securities as of june  we anticipate that the increase in total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments and the committed research funding to which we are entitled pursuant to the sanofi aventis collaboration 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition we enter into licensing and development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of monoclonal antibody based cancer therapeutics 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  or eitf in accordance with sab and eitf  we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the terms of our agreements contain multiple elements which typically include non refundable license fees  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we evaluate such arrangements to determine if the deliverables are separable into units of accounting and then applies applicable revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting 
at june   we had the following four types of collaborative contracts with the parties identified below license to a single target antigen single target license biogen idec  inc biotest ag boehringer ingelheim international gmbh centocor  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson genentech  inc multiple single target licenses millennium pharmaceuticals  inc broad option agreements to acquire rights to a limited number of targets over a specified time period broad license amgen  inc formerly abgenix  inc 
genentech  inc broad agreement to discover  develop and commercialize antibody based anticancer products sanofi aventis non exclusive license to our humanization technology sanofi aventis generally  the foregoing collaboration agreements provide that we will i at the collaborator s request  manufacture preclinical and clinical materials at our cost  or  in some cases  cost plus a margin  ii earn payments upon the collaborators achievements of certain milestones and iii earn royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or twelve years after product launch 
we are required to provide technical training and to share any process improvements and know how with its collaborators during the research term of the collaboration agreements 
generally  upfront payments on single target licenses are deferred over the period of our substantial involvement during development 
our employees are available to assist the company s collaborators during the development of their products 
we estimate this development phase to begin at the inception of the collaboration agreement and conclude at the end of non pivotal phase ii testing 
we believe this period of involvement is  depending on the nature of the license  on average six and one half years 
quarterly  we reassess our periods of substantial involvement over which we amortize our upfront license fees 
in the fiscal year ended june   this reassessment increased the recognition of license and milestone fees by approximately  from the prior year s estimate 
in the event that a single target license were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
we defer upfront payments received from our broad licenses over the period during which the collaborator may elect to receive a license 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement  but are between seven and twelve years 
if a collaborator selects an option to acquire a license under these agreements  any option fee is deferred and recorded over the life of the option  generally to months 
if a collaborator exercises an option and we grant a single target license to the collaborator  we defer the license fee and accounts for the fee as it would an upfront payment on a single target license  as discussed above 
in the event a broad license agreement were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
in the event a collaborator elects to discontinue development of a specific product candidate under a single target license  but retains its right to use our technology to develop an alternative product candidate to the same target or a target substitute  we would cease amortization of any remaining portion of the upfront fee until there is substantial preclinical activity on another product candidate and our remaining period of substantial involvement can be estimated 
when milestone fees are specifically tied to a separate earnings process and are deemed to be substantive and at risk  revenue is recognized when such milestones are achieved 
in addition  we recognizes research and development support revenue from certain collaboration and development agreements based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research agreement 
deferred revenue substantially represents amounts received under collaborative agreements and not yet earned pursuant to these policies 
where we have no continuing involvement  we will record non refundable license fees as revenue upon receipt and will record revenue upon achievement of milestones by its collaborative partners 
we produce preclinical and clinical materials for its collaborators 
we are reimbursed for our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials and  in some cases  direct and overhead costs plus a profit margin 
we recognize revenue on preclinical and clinical materials when the materials have passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
we also produce research material for potential collaborators under material transfer agreements 
additionally  we perform research activities  including developing antibody specific conjugation processes  on behalf of its collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
generally  we are reimbursed for our direct and overhead costs of producing these materials or providing these services 
we record the amounts received for the materials produced or services performed as a component of research and development support 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of dm and dm  collectively referred to as dmx  and ansamitocin p in excess of twelve month projected usage that is not supported by firm  fixed collaborator orders and projections at the time of the assessment to be excess 
to date  we have fully reserved any such material identified as excess with a corresponding charge to research and development expense 
our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and maximum tolerated dose of each clinical trial 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual twelve month usage of dmx and ansamitocin p varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
reductions in collaborators projections could indicate that we have has additional excess dmx and or ansamitocin p inventory and we would then evaluate the need to record further write downs  which would be included as charges to cost of clinical materials reimbursed 
in the fiscal year we did not incur any charges to cost of clinical materials reimbursed related to ansamitocin p and dmx inventory that we identified as excess based upon our inventory policy or write downs of ansamitocin p and dmx batches to their net realizable value 
stock compensation as of june   we have one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc employee  director and consultant equity incentive plan 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
r  share based payment  or statement r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or statement  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical data as well as current trend 
the compensation cost that has been incurred during each year ended june  and is million 
derivatives derivative instruments include a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate the risk of exchange fluctuations for manufacturing development contracts to be paid in euros 
derivatives are estimated at fair value and classified as other current assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these instruments represent the present value of estimated future cash flows under the contracts  which are a function of underlying interest rates  currency rates  related volatility  counterparty creditworthiness and duration of the contracts 
changes in these factors or a combination thereof may affect the fair value of these instruments 
we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes  and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
net gains on forward contracts for the year ended june  were  and are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as other income 
as of june   we had outstanding forward contracts with amounts equivalent to approximately million million in euros  all maturing on or before march  as of june   there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
we do not anticipate using derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging our exchange rate exposure 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to higher revenues from research development support and clinical materials reimbursement  as well as increases in license and milestone fees  as discussed below 
the million decrease in revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower revenues from clinical materials reimbursement  partially offset by higher revenues from research development support  as well as increases in license and milestone fees 
research and development support was million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent committed research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  as well as amounts earned for resources utilized under our development and license agreements with biogen idec  centocor  and genentech 
research and development support for the year ended june  also includes amounts earned for resources utilized under our development and license agreement with biotest 
under the terms of the sanofi aventis agreement  we are entitled to receive committed research funding totaling not less than million over the five years of the research collaboration  which includes the initial three year term of the research program ending august  plus the two month extensions beginning september  also included in research and development support revenue are fees related to samples of research grade material shipped to collaborators 
to date  our development fees represent the direct and overhead costs incurred in producing research grade materials and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators product candidates and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from research and development support from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  collaborative partner sanofi aventis biogen idec biotest centocor genentech other total revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased approximately  to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million related to the achievement of a milestone under the sanofi aventis agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of ave  as well as amounts earned under the humanization license and option agreements with sanofi aventis 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million related to the achievement of a milestone under the genentech agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of trastuzumab dm  along with amounts earned under the three year renewal of the broad access agreement with genentech 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million related to the achievement of milestones under the sanofi aventis agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of ave and for the preclinical advancement of sar total revenue recognized from license and milestone fees from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  collaborative partner amgen formerly abgenix biogen idec biotest boehringer ingelheim centocor genentech millennium sanofi aventis total deferred revenue of million at june  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license and supply agreements with them  which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
clinical materials reimbursement increased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of a number of clinical trials including  for certain of these years  the bivatuzumab mertansine  mln  trastuzumab dm and ave clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials in support of the development efforts of certain other collaborators 
the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to the advancement of the clinical trials of trastuzumab dm  along with significant amounts of dm used in development efforts 
the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to a reduction in demand primarily related to clinical material to support the now terminated boehringer ingelheim and millennium programs 
we are reimbursed for our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials plus  for certain programs  a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed  is directly related to i the number of on going clinical trials our collaborators have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and ii our production of clinical grade material on behalf of our collaborators  either in anticipation of clinical trials  or for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses we report research and development expense net of certain reimbursements we receive from our collaborators 
our net research and development expenses relate to i research to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic drugs  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas activities pursuant to our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  activities pursuant to our development and license agreements with various other collaborators  activities related to the preclinical and clinical development of hun dm and huc dm  process development related to production of the hun antibody and hun dm conjugate for clinical materials  process development related to production of the huc antibody and huc dm conjugate for clinical materials  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  funded development activities with contract manufacturers for the hun antibody  the huc antibody  and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing plant  process improvements to our tap technology  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and or in licensed product candidates and technologies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  the number of our research and development personnel increased to for the year ended june  compared to at june  we had research and development personnel for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the years ended june  and is million of stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r on july  also included in salaries and related expense for the year ended june  is  in severance costs related to the departure of two senior personnel  partially offset by the vacancies in those positions for balance of the year 
facilities expense  including depreciation  increased  during the year ended june  as compared to the same period in and increased million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the increase in facilities expense in was principally due to an increase in depreciation and amortization  an increase in salaries and related expenses  and higher utility costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is due to the acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements for our cambridge facilities resulting from our anticipated move from cambridge in fiscal  as well as new capital purchases 
the increase in facilities expense in was principally due to the addition of two manufacturing suites placed in service during also contributing to the increase in was an increase in administrative expenses primarily resulting from increased rent for the facilities  real estate taxes and operating expenses  and higher utility costs 
we are unable to accurately estimate which potential products  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or that we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or prevent our obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other factors  the clinical indications  the timing  size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impractical to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase as we expand our clinical trial activity 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development research and development preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations research research includes expenses associated with activities to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic agents for our product candidates and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased million to million in from and increased million to million in from the increase in research expenses in both and was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses  and to a lesser extent  facilities expense 
the increase in salaries and related expenses was principally the result of an increase in personnel required to support our collaborators research programs 
the increase in salaries and related expense in is also due to stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r as of july  preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased  to million in from and million to million in from in and there were substantial increases in salaries and related expense  the result of an increase in personnel to support both our own as well as our collaborators preclinical and clinical activities  as well as salary increases  and for the increase in  stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r as of july  contract service expense increased substantially in due principally to various toxicity studies related to huc dm and hun dm clinical trial costs increased in due to the advancement of our own clinical programs 
process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased approximately  to million in from and increased approximately  to million in from the increases in and are primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses due to increases in personnel to support our own as well as our collaborators development activities  and to a lesser extent  facilities expense 
the increase in salaries and related expenses in is also due to stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r as of july  partially offsetting these increases in  contract service expense decreased significantly due principally to a decrease in process development costs related to ansamitocins p and dmx 
manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own product candidates and costs to support the operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing plant 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our preclinical studies and clinical trials  development costs with contract manufacturing organizations  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing costs related to the production of material for our collaborators are recorded as cost of clinical material reimbursed in our accompanying statement of operations 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in from and increased million to million in from the increase in was primarily the result of i an increase in contract service expense substantially due to higher development costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the potential production of later stage materials  ii an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel  as well as salary increases  iii an increase in consulting fees  and iv an increase in the cost of disposable and chemical supplies due to increased production  batch scale  and pricing 
partially offsetting these increases was higher overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators during the year 
the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of i an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel  along with stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r as of july   ii an increase in contract service expense substantially due to higher antibody purchases as well as development costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the potential production of later stage materials  iii lower overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators  iv an increase in facilities expense related to the addition of two manufacturing suites that were placed into service during the prior fiscal year  and v an increase in administrative expense resulting primarily from increases in freight in  electricity  and recruiting fees 
partially offsetting these increases was the use of material that was reserved as excess in prior fiscal years 
antibody expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials  as well as our ongoing trials  was million in  million in  and million in the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  costs incurred related to antibody production have fluctuated from period to period and we expect these cost fluctuations to continue in the future 
during fiscal  we recorded research and development expenses of million related to ansamitocin p and dmx inventory that we identified as excess based upon our inventory policy 
we did not incur any similar expenses in fiscal or reserve requirements for excess quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx are principally determined based on our collaborators forecasted demand compared to our inventory position 
due to lead times required to secure material and the changing requirements of our collaborators  expenses to provide for excess quantities have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
see inventory within our critical accounting policies above for further discussion of our inventory reserve policy 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of i an increase in salaries and related expenses due to salary increases  ii an increase in consulting fees  iii an increase in directors fees due principally to the change in payout structure  iv an increase in patent costs resulting from expanded filings  v an increase in legal fees resulting primarily from lease activity  and vi an increase in recruiting fees to fill open positions on our board of directors and within our company 
the increases in primarily relate to increases in salaries and related expenses  and expanded patent filings 
salaries and related expenses increased due to an increase in personnel  along with stock compensation costs incurred with the adoption of statement r as of july  interest income interest income for the years ended june  and was million 
interest income for the year ended june  was million 
the increase in interest income from fiscal and fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of higher yields on investments tied to market rates partially offset by the lower average investable balances in each of the last three years 
net realized losses on investments net realized losses on investments were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the net realized losses in   and are attributable to the timing of investment sales 
other income other income for the year ended june  decreased  to  as compared to an increase of  for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recorded as other income  for consideration of the expected cost of the obligations assumed by us resulting from the amendment to the january  termination agreement executed by us and vernalis 
under the terms of the amendment  we assumed responsibility as of december   at our own expense  to complete study for hun dm offsetting this amount  we incurred foreign currency translation expenses related to obligations with non us dollar based suppliers 
other income for the year ended june  was  liquidity and capital resources june  in thousands cash and short term investments working capital stockholders equity cash used for operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash flows we require cash to fund our operating expenses  including the advancement of our own clinical programs  and to make capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through equity financings in public markets and payments from our collaborators  including equity investments  license fees and research funding 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for all periods presented was to fund our net loss 
the increase in operational cash use from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal is principally due to the increased net loss  as a result of increased research and development costs and general and administrative expenses compared to the previous years  without the benefit of the reduction in working capital that occurred in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively  and substantially represents cash inflows from the sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures

we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaborator payments  including committed research funding due us under the sanofi aventis collaboration over the remainder of the research program  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the balance of fiscal and at least a portion of the following fiscal year 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be received 
should we not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified eitf  issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years our fiscal year 
the eitf reached a conclusion that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year 
statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we have evaluated the effects of adopting statement  and we currently do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
we have evaluated the effects of adopting statement  and we do not currently believe the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or statement this includes tax positions considered to be routine as well as those with a high degree of uncertainty 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two is only addressed if step one has been satisfied ie  the position is more likely than not to be sustained 
under step two  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is used in statement ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than percent 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions 
additionally  fin requires expanded disclosure requirements  which include a tabular rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
these disclosures are required at each annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
we have evaluated the effects of adopting fin and we do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and have maturities of less than one year 
our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency  resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts 
generally  these contracts provide that we receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates at specified future dates
