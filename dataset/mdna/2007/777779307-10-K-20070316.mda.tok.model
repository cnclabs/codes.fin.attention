item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of natural gas and oil properties in the united states 
we were formed as a delaware corporation in june in july  we acquired the oil and natural gas business of calpine corporation and affiliates 
we own producing and non producing oil and natural gas properties in the sacramento basin of california  the lobo and perdido trends in south texas  the state waters of texas  the gulf of mexico  the rocky mountains and other properties located in various geographical areas in the united states 
in this section  we refer to rosetta as successor and to the domestic oil and natural gas properties acquired from calpine as predecessor 
in accounting for the oil and natural gas exploration and production business  the predecessor used the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities 
however  in connection with our separation from calpine  we have adopted the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties  see critical accounting policies and estimates oil and gas activities below for further discussion of the differences on the consolidated combined financial statements of the two accounting methods 
we plan our activities and budget based on conservative sales price assumptions given the inherent volatility of oil and natural gas prices that are influenced by many factors beyond our control 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production 
our future earnings will also be impacted by the changes in the fair market value of hedges we executed to mitigate the volatility in the changes of oil and natural gas prices in future periods 
these instruments meet the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges  and until settlement  the changes in fair market value of our hedges will be included as a component of stockholder s equity to the extent effective 
in periods of rising prices  these transactions will mitigate future earnings and in periods of declining prices will increase future earnings in the respective period the positions are settled 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases 
thus  an oil and natural gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or natural gas it produces 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling and acquiring more reserves than we produce 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 
we will maintain our focus to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce our reserves 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals 
the permitting and approval process has been more difficult in recent years than in the past due to increased activism from environmental and other groups and has extended the time it takes us to receive permits 
because of our relatively small size and concentrated property base  we can be disproportionately disadvantaged by delays in obtaining or failing to obtain drilling approvals compared to companies with larger or more diverse property bases 
as a result  we are less able to shift drilling activities to areas where permitting may be easier and we have fewer properties over which to spread the costs related to complying with these regulations and the costs or foregone opportunities resulting from delays 

table of contents at the closing of the acquisition on july   we retained approximately million of the purchase price in respect to non consent properties 
as such  our operating income does not include volumes and revenues related to these oil and natural gas properties not conveyed by calpine 
the total sec pv value of these wells and the associated leases was million pretax at december  financial highlights the consolidated financial statements reflect total revenue of million on total volumes of bcfe for the year ended december  successor 
operating income was million or of total revenue and included workover costs of approximately million and million of compensation expense for stock based compensation granted to employees 
total net other income was comprised of interest expense net of capitalized interest on our credit facility offset by interest income on short term cash investments 
overall  our net income for the year ended december  successor was million or of total revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments for our financial statements and those of our predecessor 
we believe these accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the financial statements 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies
