item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software to the global semiconductor industry 
our primary product line is automated wafer probing equipment and related network software to manage information from that equipment 
in conjunction with automated test systems from other suppliers  our semiconductor manufacturing customers use our wafer probers and network software to quality test semiconductor wafers 
electroglas installed base is one of the largest in the industry  with over  wafer probers sold 
starting in  we changed our corporate strategy and refocused the company back to its core competency of wafer probers and extending its wafer probing technologies throughout the back end of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
in december  we introduced a new extended performance mm wafer prober  the 
in january  we introduced a new mm prober  the eg  that represents a major advancement in prober design and automation and is focused on providing better performance than currently available from competitors products 
our customers include both chip manufacturers and contract test companies 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
in addition  our mm wafer probers have not yet achieved broad market acceptance  which has resulted in a significant loss in overall market share 
our initial mm product  the  served the small market for mm parametric and process development applications but did not adequately meet customers requirements for high volume production test which is the large majority of the mm prober market 
the new mm prober  the eg  was developed to serve this much larger production test market 
to stay competitive  grow our business over the long term  improve our gross margins  and generate operating cash flows  we must continue to invest in new technologies and product enhancements and at the same time  as necessary  rapidly adjust our expense structure during the hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles 
due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor equipment industry and the resulting market pressures  we are focusing our efforts in the following areas controlling and aligning our costs and revenues to move to break even and then profitable levels of operation  including positive operating cash flows  developing successful products and services to meet market windows in our target markets  successfully completing the outsourcing of our manufacturing  successfully completing new customer evaluations of our mm products  and preparing ourselves for increases in customer demand while at the same time maintaining expense control and limiting increases in our cost structure 
there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful 
in order to become profitable  our market share for our products must improve

critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  allowance for doubtful accounts  guarantee obligations  tax allowances and reserves  stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  and accruals for such items as restructuring reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the sale of the company s equipment when a customer purchase order or contract has been received  when the products or services have been delivered  when the total purchase price can be assured without making significant concessions  and when the company s ability to collect from its customer has been assured 
in recognizing revenue the company makes certain assumptions and estimates  namely i the company considers a new system routinely accepted in the marketplace when three to five successful installations  based on our acceptance criteria  have been put into customer production  ii the company considers systems delivered separately from options to have value to our customers on a stand alone basis if the options have a unique price assigned and are not significant to the total amount of the order and the options are not fundamental to the functionality of the system  iii the company considers systems delivered separately from installation and training to have value to its customers on a stand alone basis because the equipment can readily be sold by the customer  customers are capable of installing the systems without the support of our installers  installation and training are routine and inconsequential to the total value of the transaction  and these services are routinely sold on a stand alone basis  and iv for most customers the company assumes that  based on past history  it will continue to collect its receivables from them without payment or product concessions  despite the fact that they have larger financial size relative to the company and despite its dependence on them in a heavily concentrated industry 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  such as training  installation and services  the delivered items are considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met i the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  ii vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists  which is based on the average price charged when each element is sold separately  and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to a delivered item  or if performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element include in a multiple element arrangement  the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and service have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically review the carrying value of inventories and non cancelable purchase commitments by reviewing sales forecasts  material usage requirements  and by reviewing the impact of changes in technology on our products including engineering design changes 
these forecasts of changes in technology  future sales  and pricing are estimates 
we may record charges to write down inventories based on these reviews and forecasts 
if there is weak demand in the semiconductor equipment markets and orders fall below our forecasts  additional write downs of inventories may be required which will negatively impact gross margins 
inventory impairment charges are considered to permanently establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable  except when the associated inventory is disposed of or sold 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of thirteen months from the date of shipment and we accrue a current liability for the estimated cost of warranty 
for our established products  this accrual is based on historical experience  and for our newer products  this accrual is based on estimates from similar products 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience unforeseen technical problems with our products in future periods to meet our product warranty requirements  revisions to our estimated cost of warranty may be required  and our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we closely monitor the collection of our accounts receivable and record a general allowance for doubtful accounts against aged accounts and a specific reserve for identified amounts that we believe are not recoverable 
we sell primarily to large  well established semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies and we have not experienced significant accounts receivable losses in the past 
we have  however  from time to time experienced slowdowns in receivable collections  especially during semiconductor equipment down cycles  as customers extend their payment schedules to conserve their cash balances 
if our customers continue to experience down cycles or if their financial conditions deteriorate  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if a customer demonstrates a pattern of renegotiating terms or requesting concessions prior to payment  we would defer revenue until the price was considered fixed and determinable 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
tax valuation allowances and reserves we establish estimates for these allowances and reserves based on historical experience and other assumptions 
it is our policy to accrue for tax exposures or to release tax reserves in the period in which the facts and circumstances arise that suggest that the valuation allowances or reserves should be modified 
when establishing the manufacturing facility in singapore  the company received a five year exemption from income taxes beginning march  under the condition that certain capital investment and expenditure milestones are reached by march  as a result of the company s strategic initiatives  which include outsourcing of the manufacturing function  the company may be exposed to a liability for the taxes that otherwise would have been due during the first four years of the tax exemption period totaling approximately million 
as a result  during  the company initiated negotiations with the singapore government to end the tax exemption period retroactively to february   and eliminate the remaining investment milestones  in exchange for a four year tax exemption 
if the singapore government does not agree to shorten the exemption period and waive the remaining investment milestones  the company could be required to meet the remaining investment milestones or pay the estimated million retroactive tax liability 
this amount has not been accrued in the financial statements as the company has the wherewithal to meet the investment milestones and management would invest in additional capital equipment in lieu of paying this tax should the singapore government decide not to revise the tax exemption agreement 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of equipment and leasehold improvements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our market share 
changes in these estimates and business divestures could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record additional asset write downs in the future 
charges related to asset impairments are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based compensation expense we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black sholes model and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
under sfas r  the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables

net sales were down for the five months ended may  versus the prior year 
these decreases were primarily due to lower system sales  largely our mm prober product lines  as customers delayed orders in the first five months of and electroglas was in a major product transition as customers began evaluation of our new mm and mm products 
this decrease in volume was partially offset by higher average selling prices period over period 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
as a result of uncertainties in this market environment  any rescheduling or cancellation of planned capital purchases by our customers will cause our sales to fluctuate 
sales to related parties are priced in the same manner as sales to other customers 
see note related party transactions net sales amounts and as a percentage of sales were as follows years ended five months ended in thousands may  may  december  may  may  unaudited europe asia international north america we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales and fluctuate as individual manufacturers and semiconductor test companies address their capacity needs at differing stages of the semiconductor demand cycle 
during through  we experienced weakness in sales across all of our major geographic regions due to industry conditions and slow customer acceptance of our mm products 
gross profit years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited gross profit gross profit as a of net sales the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to by higher inventory provisions of million due to a reduced forecast for the strip test handler product line  net of million of that reserved inventory which was subsequently sold 
the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of prober system sales 
the decrease in gross profit in the five months ended may  compared to the same period in was primarily due to lower unit sales volumes despite higher average selling prices 
also included in gross profit for the five month period ended may was a one time warranty provision benefit of million 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories and noncancelable inventory purchase commitments by evaluating material usage and manufacturing requirements to determine inventory obsolescence and excess quantities  and we reduce the carrying value of these inventories when appropriate 
we believe that our gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including changes in demand for semiconductors  competitive pressures on average selling prices  product mix  and excess manufacturing capacity costs 
continued weak demand and changes in market conditions may cause orders to be below forecasts  which may result in additional excess inventory  which would cause additional write downs of inventories and would negatively impact our gross profit margins 
engineering  research and development expenses er d years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited er d er d as a of net sales in versus  the decrease in er d was mainly due to reduced payroll and related personnel charges of million as well as lower infrastructure and facility costs of million  partially offset by higher development and evaluation costs for the eg product line of million 
in versus  the decrease in er d was primarily due to decreased spending on materials combined with a reduction in headcount following the completion of certain new product development programs 
as a percentage of net sales  er d expense was flat in versus due to lower net sales despite lower spending 
in the five months ended may  versus  the decrease in expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to reduced employee headcount and related costs as a result of restructuring efforts 
as a percentage of net sales  er d expenses increased for the five month period ended may versus as a result of lower net sales despite lower spending 
during these hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles  we intend to control discretionary expenses and continue investing in our new product programs 
engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees  and other costs associated with our ongoing efforts in product development and enhancement 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited sg a sg a as a of net sales in versus  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased new product evaluation costs of million and audit fees of million  offset by lower payroll and related personnel charges of million and decreased infrastructure and facility costs of million

as a percentage of sales  sg a increased in as a result of lower net sales despite lower spending versus in the five months ended may  versus  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to reduced facilities costs as a result of the sale of our san jose  california campus in january in addition  the company recorded a one time benefit of million in  which was of sales in the five month period ended may   as a result of the settlement of a royalty obligation 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased for the five month period ended may as a result of lower net sales 
sg a expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  travel expenses  advertising and other promotion expenses  facilities expenses  legal expenses and other infrastructure costs 
restructuring charges during the net restructuring amount was million 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in workforce 
this was offset by a favorable million benefit related to the early termination of a facility lease previously restructured in during  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to workforce reductions 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to office space reductions and severance packages 
impairment charges we performed impairment tests as of december   and  which compared currently utilized property and equipment and non current assets net book values with the expected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the assets were sufficient to recover the net book value of these assets 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge on fixed assets no longer in use 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our san jose campus to integrated device technology for approximately million and we recorded a million impairment charge based on sales price  net of closing costs 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge on fixed assets no longer in use 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the severity of these cycles is difficult to predict 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could affect our net sales and the sufficiency of estimated future cash flows 
if the estimated cash flows are not sufficient to recover the net book value of our assets we would be required to record additional impairment charges 
indemnification release in january  the company sold its san jose campus facility 
the agreement covering this sale included a provision that allowed for a two year period for the buyer to make indemnification claims up to a maximum amount of million for breaches of the agreement s representations and warranties 
at that time  the company recorded a million reserve for the net present value of the company s guarantee obligations under these indemnification provisions 
in january  after the expiration of the two year period specified in the agreement  the company reversed this reserve as no claims had been made 
interest income years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited interest income the decrease in interest income in over was primarily due to the use of cash for ongoing operations as well as the million in cash used as partial consideration in the repurchase of million of our notes 
the increase in over and for the five month period ended may  over the same period in primarily resulted from higher average cash and investment balances resulting from the proceeds of sale of our san jose  california campus in january combined with higher yields on investments 
interest expense years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited interest expense interest expense is comprised primarily of interest on our notes 
the decrease in over is primarily due to the repurchase of million of the notes in the decrease in over primarily resulted from the repurchase of million of the notes in see note convertible subordinated notes notes conversion expense and warrants gain on sale of long term investment in the fourth quarter of  we sold our minority equity investment in cascade microtech  inc in connection with their initial public offering 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale and we recorded a net gain of million 
gain on settlement of long term liability in the third quarter of  we recognized a million gain on the settlement of a long term liability to our former parent company gsx that reduced our amounts payable under a tax benefit sharing agreement from million to an aggregate of million to be paid over seven quarters starting in the fourth quarter of as of may  there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement 
debt conversion expense during may  we exchanged million of our notes for  shares of common stock and million in cash in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
at the conversion price of per share  the million of notes exchanged would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
for accounting purposes  the additional  shares of common stock  valued at million  and the million cash paid was considered an inducement for the holders to convert their notes  which combined with unamortized bond costs of million and transaction costs of million  required us to record a non operating debt conversion expense of million during the year ended may  provision benefit for income taxes years ended five months ended may  may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited provision benefit for income taxes the provision resulted from taxes accrued on the income of various foreign branches and subsidiaries 
the income tax benefit resulted primarily from a release of tax reserves related to transfer pricing issues 
the income tax provision for  the five months ended may  and the five months ended may  resulted from taxes assessed on the income of various foreign branches 
realization of our deferred tax assets depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  management concluded that a valuation allowance of million was required at may  in october of  the american jobs protection act was signed into law 
certain provisions of this act allow multinational companies to repatriate cash related foreign earnings at a favorable rate if used to create or maintain jobs in the united states 
at may   there are no plans to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries as the only cash maintained in these entities is for working capital purposes 
any repatriation of foreign earnings would have an immaterial effect on income taxes

in january  we entered into a three year operating lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in singapore with annual lease payments of approximately million 
this lease was renewed at the same rate in december during the third quarter   we renewed this lease for two years at prevailing market of million annually 
in february  we entered into a five year operating lease for a  square foot corporate headquarters building in san jose  california 
payments are due under this new lease as follows million in fiscal year  million in fiscal years and nil thereafter 
line of credit in september and january  we renewed and amended our revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
under these amendments  we may borrow up to million based upon eligible accounts receivable balances 
this amended line of credit  which has a maturity date of august   is secured by substantially all of our assets and requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
we currently maintain cash deposits of million that will be considered restricted as compensating balances to the extent we borrow against this credit line 
there were no borrowings from the credit line as of may  and  respectively 
liquidity our principal source of liquidity as of may  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
we used million of these funds on june  to repay our maturing convertible bonds 
during  we continued to emphasize reduction of our utilization of cash  maintaining spending controls and additional headcount reductions 
we currently anticipate that our future cash from operations  our available cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from the line of credit at may  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures to support planned activities through fiscal we may be required under certain circumstances to pay the singapore government past taxes of up to million see note  income taxes 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and will take further action as necessary to align our operations and reduce expenses

fin which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to uncertainties in income tax assets and liabilities 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt fin in june management is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of fin in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of its fiscal year management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this statement 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
if the fair value method is selected  a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities eitf 
at the time of issuance  an embedded conversion option in a convertible debt instrument may be required to be bifurcated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately by the issuer as a derivative under fas  based on the application of eitf subsequent to the issuance of the convertible debt  facts may change and cause the embedded conversion option to no longer meet the conditions for separate accounting as a derivative instrument  such as when the bifurcated instrument meets the conditions of issue to be classified in stockholders equity 
under eitf  when an embedded conversion option previously accounted for as a derivative under fas no longer meets the bifurcation criteria under that standard  an issuer shall disclose a description of the principal changes causing the embedded conversion option to no longer require bifurcation under fas and the amount of the liability for the conversion option reclassified to stockholders equity 
eitf should be applied to all previously bifurcated conversion options in convertible debt instruments that no longer meet the bifurcation criteria in fas in interim or annual periods beginning after december   regardless of whether the debt instrument was entered into prior or subsequent to the effective date of eitf adoption of eitf had no material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

fsp specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fsp further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment
