item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview over the past twenty three years  implant sciences corporation has both developed and acquired technologies using ion implantation and thin film coatings 
initially this technology was used in semiconductor processing but soon expanded to include various medical device applications including the modification of orthopedic joint implant surfaces to reduce polyethylene wear generation and the manufacture of products for radiation therapy treatments 
our latest application of this technology includes the manufacturing of trace explosives detection equipment 
we currently provide ion implantation services to numerous semiconductor manufacturers  research laboratories and universities 
in october and march  we acquired two california semiconductor companies  core systems core and accurel systems international accurel  respectively 
in may  we sold our accurel subsidiary for a total purchase price of approximately  other applications of our ion beam technology had been in the area of temporary brachytherapy products 
in june  we sold certain assets associated with this product and divested the prostate seed and medical software business and will now only supply services and components of this product line 
management is currently working on a plan to keep the remaining assets in service 
however  should management be unsuccessful in formalizing this plan  there is a possibility that future periods may report discontinued operations relating to these remaining assets 
on october   the company acquired core systems incorporated core 
the result of operations for the acquired company is included in the company s results of operations since the date of acquisition 
as such  the results of operations for the years ended june   and are not comparable 
the company manages its business and reports results from operations for three business segments medical  which includes orthopedic and radiopaque coatings  medical related government contracts and other related activities  security products  which includes development contracts and product sales related to the company s trace explosives detection products  and semiconductor  which includes ion implantation  disk refurbishment and source conditioning equipment 
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation of the company for the years ended june   and it should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  and  for the prior year periods ended june  and  respectively 
our revenues by business segment are as follows year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  in the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
revenues in the security products business segment were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is the result of the completion and shipment of a significant order of the company s explosive detection equipment to a customer in china in the comparable prior year period 
the company has not realized an order of the same magnitude as it had in the year ended june  the lack of sizeable unit orders has been partially offset by the award and performance of a new government contract in the explosive detection arena 
revenues in the medical segment were  for the year ended june  as compared to  in the same prior year period  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily due to the loss of the company s primary orthopedics coatings customer during the second quarter of revenues in the semiconductor business segment were  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase is due to a slight increase in krytek source conditioner unit sales 
fiscal was the first year that revenues from core were included for the full fiscal year 
core was acquired on october  total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  in the year ended june  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to increases in our security products business line combined with an increase in revenues from core since their acquisition on october  the increase in security products revenue is primarily attributable to the first significant commercial quantities of our hand held explosive detection devices being sold in fiscal and from the performance of a significant government contract granted by the transportation security administration 
revenues from core totaled approximately  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  core is included in our semiconductor segment 
revenues in our medical business segment were  for the fiscal year as compared to  for the fiscal year  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily from our seeds business and associated treatment planning systems 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended june  was  as compared to  and  for the prior year periods ended june  and  respectively 
the cost of revenues by business segment is as follows year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total total cost of revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the prior year period  a decrease of  or 
cost of revenues for our security products segment was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily due to the variable costs associated with the delivery of a significant order of hand held explosive detectors in the comparable prior year period 
cost of revenues for our semiconductor business segment were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period  a  increase  or 
this slight increase is primarily due to the increase in semiconductor revenues 
cost of revenues for our medical business segment were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period  a  decrease  or 
this decrease in cost is primarily related to the decreased sales levels in the medical group related to the loss of the company s major orthopedics coating customer in the second quarter of which in turn reduced direct labor costs 
total cost of revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the prior year period  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues for our semiconductor business segment was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period  an increase of  or 
fiscal year was the first year that the results of core were included in our operations for a full fiscal year 
core was acquired on october  cost of revenues for core were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues for our security products segment was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period 
most of the increase is attributable to materials and manufacturing costs associated with the sales of our hand held explosives detection devices 
gross margins year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin overall gross margins were of revenues in the year ended june  as compared to in the prior year 
our medical products business segments gross profit percentage was for the year ended june  as compared to for the same prior year period 
this decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of the company losing its major orthopedics coating customer which generally had higher gross margins than our other medical products 
the semiconductor segment s gross margin slightly improved from to which was partially due to having sold more krytek source conditioning units in the current year than in the prior year 
krytek units generally have a higher gross margin than our other semiconductor products and services 
the improvement from a gross margin to a gross margin in the security products segment is due primarily to the elimination of handheld explosives detection device manufacturing costs 
while the gross margins were positive for the first three quarters of fiscal  the company recognized a negative gross margin in q primarily as a result of a decline in government contract billings combined with a decline in semiconductor revenue 
technical resources were focused on internally funded projects in q  which reduced the amount of government contract revenue recognized  in addition  certain pieces of semiconductor equipment located in the wakefield facility were dismantled and relocated to sunnyvale  ca  which impacted the revenue 
during the year ended june   all manufacturing was conducted by a contract manufacturer allowing the company to reduce its manufacturing overhead 
overall gross margins were of revenues in the year ended june  as compared to a gross margin loss of in the prior year 
the increase in gross margins comes from all of our business segments 
security products gross margins were for the year ended june  as compared to a gross margin loss of in the prior year period 
the improvement in security products margin is due to the manufacturing and sale of handheld trace explosives detection devices which covered the cost of our manufacturing organization built during the prior year 
once the initial handheld explosives detector production run was completed  and the manufacturing process was proven  manufacturing was transitioned to a contract manufacturer allowing the company to reduce its manufacturing overhead 
the medical segment gross margins were for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year period 
the improvement in gross margin came from manufacturing efficiencies gained in our seeds operations primarily from increased volumes and cost reductions 
semiconductor gross margins were for the year ended june  as compared to a gross margin loss of for the prior year period 
this improvement is partially due to an increase in krytek source conditioning revenues  which generally have a higher gross margin than our other semiconductor products 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the company continues to expend funds to further the development of new products in the area of explosives and toxic substance detection 
in addition  the increase in research and development expenses relates to the volume and timing of customer funded programs  primarily through government grants and contracts 
the company charges its research and development personnel to cost of revenues for work performed on these contracts and grants 
research and development expenses prior to starting the government contracts are charged to operating expenses 
research and development expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of  or 
these expenses include  and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses relates to the increase in customer funded programs  primarily through government grants and contracts  performed in fiscal the company charges its research and development personnel to cost of revenues for work performed on these contracts and grants 
a total of  of research and development personnel costs were charged to cost of sales in the year ended june  as compared to  in the prior year period 
in addition  other costs associated with unfunded research and development projects in the prior fiscal year were expensed to research and development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in stock based compensation and commission expense paid in conjunction with the sale of our handheld explosive detection equipment combined with a decrease in outside consulting expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  an increase of  or 
this increase is partially related to  of additional selling  general and administrative expenses incurred due to the inclusion of core for the full twelve month period in fiscal core was acquired on october  and the prior year includes their costs from the day of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative also included  of share based compensation  measured at fair value  due to the adoption of sfas r accounting for stock based compensation sfas r in fiscal as compared to  of non cash stock based compensation in the prior year period measured at fair value 
during the years ended june  and  the company also recorded  and  respectively  of impairment charges to write down goodwill and long lived assets associated with the acquisition of core 
other income and expenses  net 
for the year ended june   the company recorded other income  net  of  as compared to  of other expense  net  in the comparable prior year period  a net benefit of  the net benefit realized in as compared to is primarily due to a  loss recorded in on the modification of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  accounted for as an extinguishment of debt under eitf in the year ended june   the company recorded a loss of  representing the company s share of losses attributable to its investment in cornova  an unconsolidated subsidiary accounted for under the equity method of accounting  as compared to a loss of  for the comparable prior year period 
other income and expense also includes a  gain due to the change in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock 
interest expense for the year ending june  was  as compared to  for the year ending june   an increase of  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to interest related to a short term note with laurus along with interest related to a financing arrangement with bridge bank that both began during for the year ended june   the company recorded other expense  net  of  as compared to  in the comparable prior year period an increase of  or 
other income and expense includes a loss of  representing the company s share of losses attributable to its investment in cornova  an unconsolidated subsidiary accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
other income and expense also includes a  gain due to the change in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  since its issuance on september   and a loss on the modification of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  accounted for as an extinguishment of debt under eitf of  loss from continuing operations 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  an increase  or 
the increase in net loss is primarily due to a  impairment charge related to goodwill and long lived assets on the acquisition of core  which was partially offset by a  loss recorded in on the modification of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  combined with the overall improvement in gross margins and with lower equity losses related to the company s investment in cornova 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the comparable prior year period  an increase in net loss of  or 
the increase in net loss is primarily due to a  increase in operating expenses combined with a  increase in other expenses which was partially offset by an increase in gross margin of  the fiscal net loss includes  of sfas r share based compensation and other non cash compensation compared to  of non cash compensation in the prior year period 
the company adopted fasr in the fiscal year using the modified prospective method 
preferred distribution  dividends and accretion on series d redeemable convertible preferred stock were  in the year ended june  as compared to  in the comparable prior year period 
the company issued series d redeemable convertible preferred stock on september  all previous issues of preferred stock had been converted to common in the prior year period 
preferred distribution  dividends and accretion on series d redeemable convertible preferred stock were  in the year ended june  as compared to  in the year ended june  the company issued series d redeemable convertible preferred stock on september  all previous issues of preferred stock had been converted to common in the prior year period 
income loss from discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to net income of  in the comparable prior year period 
on may   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its subsidiary  accurel systems international corporation to evans analytical group llc 
the proceeds from the sale of the assets of accurel  less related transaction costs  were less than the book value of the net assets transferred  and therefore a loss on sale of  was recorded during the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources year ended june  cash and cash equivalents cash used in continuing operations cash provided by discontinued operations net cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in continuing operations cash provided by used in discontinued operations net cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in continuing operations cash provided by used in discontinued operations net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of june   the company had approximately  in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended june   operating activities used cash of approximately  net cash used by operating activities primarily reflects the net loss from continuing operations of  a loss from discontinued operations of  and a change in the value of derivatives of  the company has approximately  of raw materials and finished goods inventories related to its handheld explosives detection product 
this inventory was built in anticipation of future shipments of this product to customers 
orders for the explosives detection product to date have typically been from foreign governments or agencies of foreign governments 
the sales cycle to these entities can take a number of months to  close the order  set up letters of credit from the customer covering the payment  and obtain the necessary export licenses and other required documentation 
expected future shipments of these products  in the near term  can be accomplished with no further investment in inventories and current levels of inventory are expected to decrease 
investing activities provided  of cash primarily due to the net proceeds of  related to the sale of our accurel subsidiary  partially offset by  that was placed in escrow related to the sale of accurel  and by  used for investment in property and equipment 
financing activities provided cash of  and consist primarily of  of proceeds from a note from laurus   in proceeds in a note from bridge bank  partially offset by  in payments on bank loans  lines of credit and capital leases 
on december   the company executed a million secured term note the note payable to laurus 
the company received  in gross proceeds  less a management fee of  and related transaction costs of approximately the term note was collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets and two of its subsidiaries  has a month term and bears interest at a rate equal to prime plus per annum 
the note contains certain restrictive and financial covenants 
in connection with the financing  the company issued laurus a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price equal to per share 
net cash proceeds from this financing were  and were used for general working capital 
this note was paid in full on may   in conjunction with the sale of the assets of accurel systems 
on january   the company executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement which amended and restated the terms of a business financing agreement originally dated as of june  with silicon valley based bridge bank  na the bank increasing the revolving credit facility from million to million 
this revolving credit facility the line of credit has a two year term  provides for advances of up to eighty percent of the company s eligible accounts receivable and up to the lesser of  or forty percent of eligible inventory  bears interest at the prime rate  plus one half percent per annum  and is secured by all assets of the company 
in conjunction with this financing  the company drew from funds available on the line of credit and paid in full the outstanding term loan balance of approximately  at comerica bank 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement  the company converted  of the outstanding line of credit balance into a month term note bearing an interest rate at the prime rate plus one percent per annum payable in thirty equal monthly installments of principal  plus all accrued interest beginning on february  in connection with the financing  the company issued the bank a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price equal to per share 
since may  we have been developing several explosive detection systems that could be used in airports  public and government buildings  and sporting event facilities 
the systems use our proprietary technology  which includes the use of a photon based non radioactive ion source in combination with ion mobility spectrometry  to electronically detect minute quantities of explosive vapor molecules in the air 
this project is currently being undertaken by both our internal scientists and outside contractors 
the development of new applications is typically funded through government grants or internal funding 
since march  we have received seventeen contracts totaling over million for detection of toxic chemicals or explosives from agencies such as the departments of the army  air force  marine corps  navy and the department of homeland security 
we are now manufacturing several versions of our explosives detection systems  including i a table top unit  which can be used to screen passengers and carry on baggage in airports and ii a portable system  which can be used to clear buildings  aircrafts  or ships where hidden bombs are believed to exist 
we are also developing  in conjunction with a contract from the transportation security administration  a walk through passenger portal 
we are currently selling our portable and bench top version of these products both domestically and internationally 
we plan to market these systems to us government agencies for use in airports  government buildings and facilities 
we are currently expending significant resources to develop the next generation of our current product and to develop new products 
although we continue to fund as much research and development as possible through government grants and contracts in accordance with the provisions of the respective grant awards we will require additional funding in order to continue the advancement of the commercial development and manufacturing of the explosives detection system 
we will attempt to obtain such financing by i government grants  ii private financing  or iii strategic partnerships 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to raise such additional financing 
consistent with our policy to protect our proprietary technologies  we have been awarded six patents and have submitted an additional five patent applications to the united states patent and trademark office 
these patents and applications will cover specific design configurations that are responsible for our improved vapor detection sensitivity 
we will require substantial funds for further research and development  regulatory approvals and the marketing of our explosives detection products 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  the progress of our research and development programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the hiring of additional personnel and capital equipment 
based on the current sales  expense and cash flow projections  including cash flows generated from the subsequent sale of its accurel subsidiary in may  the company believes that the current level of cash and cash equivalents on hand  the net proceeds from its revolving line of credit and the funds remaining on a contract received from the us army in august  will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months 
however  because there can be no assurances that sales will materialize as forecasted  management will continue to closely monitor and attempt to control costs at the company and will continue to actively seek the needed capital through government grants and awards  strategic alliances  private financing sources  and through its lending institutions 
future expenditures for research and product development  especially relating to outside testing  are discretionary and  accordingly  can be adjusted  as can certain selling  general and administrative expenses  based on the availability of cash 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s future minimum payments under contractual obligations related to capital leases  operating leases and term notes as of june  are as follows debt and capital lease operating lease med tec total total payments include interest adjusted for sublease critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of our form k as of june  our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  inventories  investments  intangible assets and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we adopted sfas no 
and  accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather such assets are subject to annual impairment reviews or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its financial statements revenue recognition product and government contract revenues the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer which states a fixed or determinable price and terms  delivery of the product has occurred or the service performed in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  and collectibility of the sale is reasonably assured 
government contract revenue under cost sharing research and development agreements is recognized as eligible research and development expenses are incurred 
the company s obligation with respect to these agreements is to perform the research on a best efforts basis 
for government contracts with a deliverable  revenue is recognized based upon the proportional performance method 
revenues for which the company has received payment  but has not yet recognized the revenues  pending fulfilling its obligations under the sales agreement  are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenues 
treatment systems planning revenues consists of sales of software licenses and maintenance agreements  product related training  installation  and consulting  and the associated hardware 
revenue from sales of software licenses and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance contract period  which is generally one year  pursuant to the guidance provided by statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
revenue from training  installation  consulting services and the associated hardware are recognized as the services are performed or product is delivered  provided there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value which is the price charged when the services are sold separately 
revenues related to such sales generated during the year ended june  and were  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended june  were immaterial 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
judgments are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a combination of factors 
such factors include historical collection experience  credit policy and specific customer collection issues 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely impact our operating cash flows in that period 
sales returns and allowances the company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
we record estimated allowances against revenues in the same period the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis of our credit memo data and other known factors for pricing and disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
to date  allowances have not been material 
actual returns may differ significantly from our estimates if factors such as economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories we value our inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete or excess based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in warranty return rates or costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
valuation of certain marketable equity securities the company currently classifies its investment securities as available for sale securities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  such securities are measured at fair market value in the financial statements with unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the securities are sold or otherwise disposed of 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 a decline in fair market value below cost that is other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss 
to date  we have not experienced any realized losses 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of  as of june   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  management compares the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires management to make estimates based on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  management has selected august st as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with the company s acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer base  technology and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on a basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced or straight line over the estimated useful lives  if no other method provides a better result 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets with finite lives been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
equity transactions the company evaluates the proper classification of its equity transactions under sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristic of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that for instruments that embody an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring assets at a determinable date or that contain certain conditional obligations  typically classified as equity  be classified as a liability 
in many of our financing transactions  warrants have been issued 
additionally  we issue options and warrants to non employees from time to time as payment for services 
in all of these cases  we apply the principles of sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation to value these awards  which inherently include a number of estimates and assumptions including stock price volatility factors 
the company records financing and certain offering costs associated with its capital raising efforts in its statements of operations 
these include amortization of debt issue costs such as cash  warrants and other securities issued to finders and placement agents  and amortization of preferred stock discount created by in the money conversion features on convertible debt accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and issue  application of issue to certain convertible instruments  by other securities issued in connection with preferred stock as a result of allocating the proceeds amongst the securities in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  based on their relative fair values 
we based our estimates and assumptions on the best information available at the time of valuation  however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the valuation of the underlying instruments 
the company determined its series d redeemable convertible preferred stock contained certain derivative instruments and accounts for such instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 the company bifurcated these derivative instruments from the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  recorded them as a liability  and includes the changes in the fair value of the instruments within other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes sfas no 
also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of this standard and is not certain of the potential impact at this time 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
eitf fsp 
this fsp addresses an issuer s accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb no 
the guidance in this fsp amends fasb statements and and fasb interpretation no 
to include scope exceptions for registration payment arrangements 
this fsp further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment arrangement 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has adopted this fsp in the current fiscal year ending june  the company s adoption of this fsp in the current fiscal year has not had a material effect on its financial position  operations or cash flow 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas no 
also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas no 
does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards  including fair value measurement disclosures in sfas no 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of statement no 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
