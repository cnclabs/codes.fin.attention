special note to canadian investors nexen is an sec registrant and a form k and related forms filer 
therefore  our reserves estimates and securities regulatory disclosures follow sec requirements 
in  canadian regulatory authorities adopted national instrument standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities ni which prescribes that canadian companies follow certain standards for the preparation and disclosure of reserves and related information 
we have been granted the following exemptions permitting us to substitute our sec disclosures for much of the annual disclosure required by ni  prepare our reserves estimates and related disclosures in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us  and the standards of the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements  dispense with the requirement to have our reserves estimates and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein  included in the supplementary financial information  evaluated or audited by independent qualified reserves evaluators  and not disclose certain prescribed information pertaining to prospects if such disclosures would result in the contravention of a legal obligation  would likely be detrimental to our competitive interests or the information does not exist 
as a result of these exemptions  canadian investors should note the following fundamental differences in reserves estimates and related disclosures contained in the form k sec registrants apply sec reserves definitions and prepare their reserves estimates in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the us whereas ni requires adherence to the definitions and standards promulgated by the coge handbook  the sec mandates disclosure of proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein calculated using year end constant prices and costs only whereas ni also requires disclosure of reserves and related future net revenues using forecast prices  the sec mandates disclosure of proved and proved developed reserves by geographic region only whereas ni requires disclosure of more reserve categories and product types  the sec does not prescribe the nature of the information required in connection with proved undeveloped reserves and future development costs whereas ni requires certain detailed information regarding proved undeveloped reserves  related development plans and future development costs  the sec does not require disclosure of finding and development f d costs per boe of proved reserves additions whereas ni requires that various f d costs per boe be disclosed 
ni requires that f d costs be calculated by dividing the aggregate of exploration and development costs incurred in the current year and the change in estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves by the additions to proved reserves in the current year 
however  this will generally not reflect full cycle finding and development costs related to reserve additions for the year  the sec leaves the engagement of independent qualified reserves evaluators to the discretion of a company s board of directors whereas ni requires issuers to engage such evaluators and to file their reports  the sec does not consider the upgrading component of our integrated oil sands project at long lake as an oil and gas activity  and therefore permits recognition of bitumen reserves only 
ni specifically includes such activity as an oil and gas activity and recognizes synthetic oil as a product type  and therefore permits recognition of synthetic reserves 
at year end  we have recognized million barrels before royalties of proved bitumen reserves million barrels after royalties under sec requirements  whereas under ni we would have recognized million barrels before royalties of proved synthetic reserves million barrels after royalties  and the sec considers our syncrude operation as a mining activity rather than an oil and gas activity  and therefore does not permit related reserves to be included with oil and gas reserves 
ni specifically includes such activity as an oil and gas activity and recognizes synthetic oil as a product type  and therefore permits them to be included with oil and gas reserves 
we have provided a separate table showing our share of the syncrude proved reserves as well as the additional disclosures relating to mining activities required by sec requirements 
the foregoing is a general description of the principal differences only 
ni requires that we make the following disclosures we use oil equivalents boe to express quantities of natural gas and crude oil in a common unit 
a conversion ratio of mcf of natural gas to barrel of oil is used 
boe may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation 
the conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead
