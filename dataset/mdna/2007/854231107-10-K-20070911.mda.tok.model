item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading producer of a variety of products and services for diverse market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group  engraving group  hydraulics products group and engineered products group 
because these segments serve different markets  the performance of each is affected by different external and economic factors 
our strategy involves the acquisition of businesses that compliment existing operations  the disposition of businesses that no longer fit strategically with the other operations and a continued reduction in operating costs through the implementation of lean manufacturing processes  sourcing materials and manufacturing product in lower cost countries 
we call our strategy focused diversity 
in fiscal we took several steps in advancing the company s focused diversity strategy involving both the disposition and acquisition of multiple businesses 
we continued to source and manufacture more components and products in lower cost areas including china and mexico 
we also faced several economic cycles that affected the performance of our businesses in fiscal some of our major accomplishments included disposing of the consumer group businesses in the first quarter of the fiscal year  acquiring two food service equipment businesses  expanding our product offerings and our distribution channels  bringing fully operational two new facilities in china serving our engineered products and engraving groups  selling off excess real estate resulting in a gain of million 
we also established plans that will benefit future periods including the creation of a new entity in turkey and the identification of additional sourcing opportunities from china 
we continued our implementation of lean manufacturing techniques across all of our businesses  continually focusing on improving the efficiencies within our operations 
these activities will position our businesses to take advantage of their market positions now and  for some of our businesses  when the economic cycles swing into growth again 
during fiscal  our air distribution products  hydraulics products and engraving groups experienced declines in sales and profits 
sales in our air distribution products group adp declined almost year over year 
this business supplies galvanized steel duct work to the residential housing market  which saw significant declines during fiscal sales in our hydraulics products group  which supplies telescoping cylinders used in the heavy construction vehicle market  also declined due to the decline in its principal market 
finally  our engraving group  which supplies mold texturization services to the automotive industry  saw declines year over year 
the combination of our acquisitions and performances in some of our other businesses offset these declines in sales  resulting in an overall increase in sales of over 
 as part of our strategy  we are focusing our resources on those businesses where synergies can be leveraged to enhance the performance of the individual businesses 
consistent with our strategy  we divested the businesses of the consumer products group 
we determined that this group had no synergies with any of our other business groups or among themselves 
the businesses of the group include standard publishing  berean christian stores and standex direct 
for fiscal  the results from these operations and the gain from the dispositions have been included in discontinued operations throughout this report 
we made two acquisitions during fiscal in january  we completed the purchase of all the outstanding stock of associated american industries  inc aai or apw wyott 
with annual sales of million  aai is a leader in hot side food service equipment and has brands with global recognition among customers in the food service market 
aai s apw wyott brand manufactures primarily counter top products used in cooking  toasting  warming and merchandising food for applications in quick service restaurants  convenience stores  small restaurants and concession areas 
in addition to apw wyott  aai s brands include bakers pride  which provides a wide selection of deck ovens  pizza ovens  conveyor ovens and counter top ranges  griddles and char broilers to meet the needs of the restaurant  pizza  supermarket and conveni ence store market segments  and bevles  which produces strong  durable heated proofer and holding cabinets for the restaurant and baking market segments 
the addition of aai will complement our existing hot side business  bki  while providing us with opportunities to cross market to new customers our existing portfolio of products 
this acquisition will also provide us a sizeable presence in the hot food preparation  storage and merchandising equipment market 
also in january  we acquired substantially all the assets of american foodservice company afs  a food service equipment manufacturer with expertise in stainless steel fabrication  millwork and solid surface stonework 
with annual sales of approximately million  afs will enable us to capture demand for high end  custom fabricated foodservice equipment across a spectrum of new cafeteria and commissary applications in markets including corporate offices  healthcare facilities and hospitals  colleges and universities  and casinos and hotels 
there are a number of key external factors other than general business and economic conditions that can impact the performance of our businesses 
the key factors affecting each business are described below in the segment analysis 
there are several items that affect the comparability of our performance information between the periods discussed in this report 
these items included the completion of our manufacturing facility in mexico  the million in start up costs in connection with the start up of this operation in fiscal and the pre tax restructuring costs of  in connection with the relocation of manufacturing activities to the mexico plant in fiscal we monitor a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin other operating income restructuring expense income from operations backlog net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales decline growth the increase in net sales of million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year  is entirely attributable to acquisitions made during the year 
sales in our adp  hydraulics products and engraving groups all experienced declines  as downturns in the housing  heavy truck and automotive industries impacted the sales of these groups 
in addition to these sales declines  our master bilt refrigeration walk in and cabinet business experienced a sales decline in fiscal this decline was offset by improvements in several of the other businesses of our food service equipment group 
discussions of these performances are more fully detailed below in the segment analysis 
net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
the two acquisitions completed in fiscal added million while the effect of exchange rates reduced sales by  the remaining sales increase of million represents organic growth 
organic sales are defined as sales from businesses which were included in our results for both the current reporting period and the same period of the previous year  and include the effect of price changes 
the increase in organic sales growth was led by businesses within the food service equipment  engraving and hydraulics products groups 
price increases accounted for over of the organic growth with the remainder due to volume increases 
a further discussion by segment follows 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin  like our sales  declined in fiscal to from in during fiscal  the sales decline caused our output volumes to decrease  resulting in negative impacts to our gross margins 
in addition many of our businesses experienced material cost increases which we were unable to pass onto our customers 
of the businesses impacted  our adp and master bilt businesses experienced the greatest declines year over year 
our consolidated gross profit margin improved to in fiscal from in the increase is attributable to significant improvements in the adp group  resulting from a combination of price increases and lower steel costs 
the margin improvement in the adp group was partially offset by reduced margins in the engineered products group 
the reduction was attributable to the favorable impact on margins in of the renegotiation of a long term supply contract discussed further below 
margins within the remaining operating segments were largely unchanged from the prior year 
other operating income expense and restructuring the company includes restructuring charges and certain other operating expenses and income as separate line items 
other operating income expense includes gains or losses on the sale of real property 
during fiscal  we completed the closure of one manufacturing location and the consolidation of those operations into an existing facility within our engineered products group 
we incurred restructuring costs of  in connection with this closure 
we also completed the sale of excess land located at our corporate location  resulting in a gain of million in fiscal we incurred restructuring costs during fiscal of  compared to million in the prior year 
during fiscal  we completed construction of a manufacturing facility in mexico 
the restructuring costs in were due to the relocation of two us plants  one in the food service equipment group and one in the adp group  to the new manufacturing facility in mexico 
the sale of the two closed us locations resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately  which was offset by  in losses on the disposition of excess operational assets within various segments 
income from operations our income from operations decreased over million  or when compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  the decline was over million 
this decline is due to several factors 
our adp group s income from operations declined by million  or over  when compared to fiscal our food service equipment group  excluding the impact of acquisitions  declined by million  or  when compared to fiscal our engraving and hydraulics products groups also declined year over year 
these declines were partially offset by reduced corporate expenses 
these changes are more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income from operations increased million in fiscal  an increase over fiscal both the adp and engraving groups had double digit increases  fueling the consolidated improvement 
these positive performances were offset by declines in the food service equipment and engineered products groups 
a further discussion is included in the segment discussions that follow 
income taxes our effective income tax rate declined to compared to the prior year s effective rate of 
the effective tax rate in fiscal includes a benefit from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves  that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes and a benefit from the impact resulting from retroactive extension of the r d credit  recognized in the second quarter 
these benefits were offset by an accrual  that the company made in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for income taxes in special areas apb 
the company decided to repatriate a certain portion of its previously undistributed foreign earnings 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  an increase from in the prior year 
the increase was largely attributable to the reduction in qualified research and development activities and the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december  capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in fiscal  we reduced our capital expenditures due in large part to the re direction of our capital to the two acquisitions 
we spent million during fiscal in fiscal  we spent million  an increase of million when compared to one year earlier  primarily due to the million spent for the new manufacturing facility in mexico 
backlog backlog at june  increased million when compared to fiscal  a increase year over year 
this increase is due largely to the acquisitions  which resulted in an additional million in backlog at the end of the fiscal year 
backlog at the end of fiscal increased million  a increase from the prior year 
increased order activity within the engraving and engineered products groups led the improvement 
within the food service equipment group  the refrigerated walk in and cabinet businesses experienced decreases from the prior year 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group hydraulics products group engineered products food service equipment with the completion of two acquisitions in the food service equipment group fseg during fiscal  sales increased more than million when compared to fiscal  a increase 
the increase in sales is almost completely attributable to acquisitions  which added million 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  sales within the fseg were largely unchanged from the prior year  increasing  or less than when compared to fiscal during the fiscal year  several of our existing businesses experienced double digit increases in sales in their core markets served 
the organic growth rate of our pump and display case businesses was over during the fiscal year while our nor lake refrigeration walk in and cabinet business experienced a increase 
the combination of these increases added an additional mill ion to sales in fiscal a combination of the strength of the core markets and price increases obtained were the primary drivers behind the sales performances 
the relocation of the pump business s manufacturing activities to mexico in fiscal resulted in a decline in sales in that year 
the pump sales rebounded in fiscal these positive sales performances were offset by a decline of  or million  in our master bilt refrigeration walk in and cabinet sales 
in the first half of our fiscal year  a combination of quality and delivery issues resulted in a deterioration in sales volume during that period 
during the second half of the fiscal year  sales increased as both the quality and delivery issues were resolved 
in the most recently completed quarter  sales returned to substantially the same level as the prior period 
net sales in fiscal increased million  a increase when compared to fiscal acquisitions accounted for million of the increase while unfavorable exchange rates reduced sales by  excluding those items  sales increased million  or 
volume improvements in certain core products  including refrigerated walk in and cabinet units  were the primary reasons for the overall increase in sales while price increases in a number of the products offered by fseg accounted for the remainder 
during fiscal  fseg continued penetrating dealer buying groups serving the foodservice markets 
during the second half of the year  our brands sold well through this type of sales channel 
the sales improvement for fseg came during a period of transition  with the closure and relocation to mexico of our pump manufacturing activities and the manufacturing operations of kool star  the acquisition made in november these moves necessitated fseg  especially our pump business  to focus on the manufacture and delivery of beverage pumps causing some reduction in sales in pumps for commercial applications when compared to the same period one year earlier 
air distribution products our adp group experienced the most significant decrease in sales in fiscal of all our segments 
sales in fiscal decreased by over million  a decrease compared to fiscal this group serves the residential new home market 
this market experienced significant declines year over year 
new housing starts decreased over from their peak levels reached in prior years 
our business generally lags behind the impact of these declines by one quarter 
our sales were impacted the most during the second half of fiscal a number of steps were taken during fiscal which benefited sales and are expected to continue to benefit sales into the future 
several regional competitors have ceased operations 
we believe that this positions our group to take advantage of our national delivery capabili ties to gain market share in these various regions 
a number of new opportunities are being pursued with some success already impacting our fiscal results 
we continue to focus on our current customers while looking for additional opportunities in geographical areas currently viewed by management as under penetrated 
our current indications are that the slowdown in housing starts will continue to negatively impact sales for this group through fiscal net sales in fiscal were relatively flat when compared to the same period one year earlier  decreasing  or a change from the prior year levels 
the decrease was a combination of decreased volume with product price increases during the year 
the volume decline can be largely attributed to the slow down in housing starts and permits in the geographical regions served by our plants 
engraving group sales in our engraving group declined by million  or  from the level in fiscal  due primarily to the mold texturization side of the business 
during fiscal  acquisitions added million in sales while the effects of foreign exchange added an additional million 
excluding these impacts  sales declined by million when compared to fiscal the largest industry served by the texturization business is the automotive industry 
sales to this industry are driven by the number of new model introductions and redesigns manufacturers do to the interior and exterior of models their various models 
during fiscal  sales to the automotive industry experienced a decline in orders due to the reduction in model introductions and redesigns 
we expect volumes to increase in fiscal in the mold texturizati on side of the business 
we have taken several steps within this group that are expected to benefit the future periods 
during fiscal  we opened a second texturization facility in china to serve customers in the shanghai area 
this facility will complement our facility in southern china 
we are also opening a new facility in turkey in fiscal to serve a number of our existing and potentially new customers in that area 
we continue to believe that our structure and technology make us capable of taking advantage of our customers desires to deal with one company worldwide and deliver the design consistency that we believe our customers require in this global marketplace 
sales will continue to be impacted by design cycles within the automotive industry 
from time to time  we may need to close facilities as our customers leave areas 
we believe that our current geographical locations and our future location in turkey position our group to continue to serve our customers more effectively than our competitors 
net sales increased million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase while favorable exchange rates added an additional  the remaining increase of million was attributable to strong demand within the group s mold texturization business  especially from its automotive customers 
the automotive business benefited in from a large number of interior and exterior redesigns that many automotive manufacturers performed during the fiscal year in response to customer demands for a wider variety of choice 
the mold texturization business also grew internationally  especially in china  where the engraving group has decided to open an additional operation in central china  in the first quarter of fiscal to complement the existing facility in southern china 
the positive sales performance of the mold texturization business was offset by declines in the engraving group s other two businesses  roll and plate engraving and embossing equipment 
many of the customers served by these businesses  including consumer and building products suppliers  reduced their orders in hydraulics products group sales declined by million  or  in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the declines were in the us market  where several events occurred over the last year causing a decline in the group s sales 
the most significant of these events was a change in epa regulations that impacted the heavy trucking industry 
these changes were designed to reduce emissions on long haul trucks 
the changes required to meet the new emissions standards were expected to reduce the fuel efficiency on engines 
this prompted a large number of orders for dump truck and trailers before the effective date of january  this advanced buying impacted positively our fiscal performance  making the year over year comparison more difficult 
we are taking several steps to position the group to take advantag e of the potential global markets growth 
in fiscal  we opened a repair shop in china  housed in one of our existing operations  to serve this growing market 
cylinders were manufactured in the us and shipped to a dealer network we were developing in china 
in fiscal we will commence the manufacturing of these cylinders in china 
in addition  we have established a new operation in portugal and have established a relationship with a hydraulics pump manufacturer in that country whereby both parties will use each others distribution and sales channels to expand sales in europe and diversify sales in the us these steps are expected to impact sales favorably in fiscal and beyond 
net sales increased by million  or in fiscal over fiscal this increase was all organic  brought about by increases in volume and  to a lesser extent  price increases 
sales increases were most noticeable in the dump truck and trailer industry served by the group 
market share gains in the us  significant order activity in the north american market and increased penetration into europe and asia have contributed to the increased sales 
engineered products sales in this group increased million  or  in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
this group is comprised of three businesses  two metal spinning and fabrication businesses and one electronics business 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses  which serve customers in the energy  aviation and aerospace industries  experienced growth year over year  accounting for the majority of the increase in this group 
recent trends within the energy  aerospace  and aviation industries show that manufacturers are increasingly sourcing fabricated metal parts from third parties rather than manufacturing these parts themselves 
this trend is expected to benefit our metal spinning businesses 
our sales to the energy  aviation and aerospace industries are expected to continue to increase at a pace above gdp fo r the next several years  which will require us to invest additional capital into these businesses 
our electronics business also experienced growth during the year due to the combination of price increases and volume increases 
net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal when compared to fiscal in fiscal  the metal spinning business renegotiated a supply arrangement with a large aerospace customer which resulted in a reduced sales volume under the arrangement in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result  sales of that business decreased million year over year 
this decrease was partially offset by improved sales volume for energy and other aerospace projects 
sales of electronic components were consistent with levels in the prior year 
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group hydraulics products engineered products restructuring other expenses  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment performance decreased  in fiscal  a decline from fiscal acquisitions added million in income from operations during fiscal  consistent with our expectations 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  income from operations declined by million  or  compared to fiscal the decline is attributable to several factors 
first  the positive sales performances discussed above added an additional million in income from operations 
our pump business s income from operations increased more than while our nor lake refrigeration walk in and cabinet business s income from operations increased more than when compared to fiscal these positive performances were offset by a decline in our master bilt business  whose year over year income from operations declined over million 
this business was negatively impacted by decreased sales volumes  an inability to pass on material cost increases to customers and increased warranty costs associated with quality issues early in our fiscal year 
the reduction of costs  including material and warranty costs  continues to be one of our key focuses 
we continue to look for opportunities to leverage our size in negotiations with key vendors such as steel  compressor and freight carriers 
we also continue to look for opportunities to source components from china and other low cost countries 
we are also focusing on integrating our recent acquisitions 
several steps were taken during fiscal that are expected to benefit and beyond 
we have already used the different customers among our existing businesses and our newly acquired businesses to create cross selling opportunities 
we have combined sales channels for bki  our existing hot side business  with those of apw wyott  creating opportunities to expand bki s products into the quick serve and casual dining restaurant markets  which we believe will benefit both the sales and bottom line of that brand 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  an decline from fiscal the decline can be attributed to several factors 
first  the relocation of the pump manufacturing operations to the new facility in mexico resulted in start up costs and related inefficiencies of million 
second  the shutdown and relocation to mexico of our newly acquired kool star business resulted in higher shipping  labor and travel costs of  third  fseg was affected by a combination of sales mix changes when compared to the prior year  increased buying group activity at lower margins and material cost increases in excess of price increases 
many of the materials used in our refrigerated products  such as steel  foam insulation and copper  have experienced price increases and fluctuations throughout the fiscal year due to worldwi de demand and other market forces 
during fiscal  fseg implemented price increases to partially offset the higher material costs 
air distribution products income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or 
this decrease is due to the combination of the sales declines discussed above and margin deteriorations due to material price increases and other costs 
in response to the continued negative outlook and the inability to pass the material price increases fully through to customers  adp is implementing raw material cost reduction strategies 
in fiscal  we relocated some of our manufacturing activities into mexico to take advantage of a lower cost structure and to geographically position us to deliver product to the southwest us housing market 
with the housing market declines widespread  we have not yet achieved the sales volume needed in that region to support the cost structure of the mexican facility  including the freight costs  adding additional costs to our b ottom line over the last six months 
recent wins in that region have proven to be difficult to achieve reasonable profit margins 
thus  unless additional sales volume is obtained in the region or prices are increased  additional costs would continue to be added to the performance of adp into fiscal therefore  we committed to a plan to no longer manufacture product from our mexico plant in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the performance 
income from operations increased million in fiscal  or 
the improvement is attributable to price increases in advance of material cost increases 
adp procures a significant amount of steel from a foreign source  with generally lower prices and longer lead times than are offered by local sources 
the increase included approximately  in start up related costs associated with our relocation of manufacturing activities to the new facility in mexico 
engraving group income from operations decreased by million  or  when compared to fiscal the positive performance of the business acquired in was more than offset by decreases in our mold texturization businesses 
the sales delays in that business and the high level of fixed costs associated with those businesses caused income from operations to be depressed during the year 
income from operations increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
a combination of the acquisition of innovent in november and sales increases contributed to the improvement in income from operations 
with the higher volume of mold texturization business in fiscal combined with technology improvements  the engraving group was able to gain efficiencies while increasing output 
this was most noticeable in our international operations  the year over year income from operations which increased over due largely to the automotive demand of the mold texturization business 
these positive performances were partially offset by sale volume decreases in the roll engraving and embossing machinery businesses 
in fiscal  the engraving group benefited from increased embossing machinery orders that did not repeat in fiscal due to softening markets 
hydraulics products income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the combination of sales declines of and costs associated with our expansion into china resulted in the decrease in income from operations 
we have been testing several materials sourced from china  with recent batches tested yielding the results desired by management 
this is encouraging both as a potential reduction in material costs and for the commencement of manufacturing operations in china 
income from operations increased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the hydraulics products group hydraulics was able to leverage the increase in sales volume without increasing costs incrementally 
during fiscal  hydraulics introduced several new products including a new cylinder designed for the european market to expand the geographical reach of hydraulics 
in connection with this introduction  additional costs were incurred including increased selling and marketing costs  increased distribution costs and other operating cost increases 
we believe that these costs represent a necessary investment in the introduction of a new product that is important to the continued growth of hydraulics 
engineered products income from operations increased million in fiscal  a increase when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the improvement is largely due to our electronics business 
in fiscal  we initiated manufacturing activities in china for this business 
by the end of fiscal  we achieved our goal of producing in china nearly of all of our product sold 
this contributed to the improvement in income from operations performance for this business 
in addition  we consolidated our us based operations into two locations  from three previously 
the reduction in fixed costs resulting from this consolidation contributed to the improved operating performance of this unit s business 
we are planning to increase the amount of product manufactured in china to by the end of fiscal our met al spinning businesses contributed an additional  in income from operations to the group on the strong sales performances discussed above 
the improvement in income from operations lagged the sales performance primarily due to a shift between products sold into the energy and aviation industry verses the aerospace business 
margins within the energy and aviation products generally are lower than those for aerospace products 
recently  our business was named the sole source supplier of fuel tank domes for the atlas v launch vehicle program 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  a decline when compared to the same period one year earlier 
during fiscal  the electronics business experienced increases in material costs coupled with duplicative costs associated with restructuring activities undertaken during the year 
this business was in the process during the year of consolidating two existing us locations into one  which will improve efficiency going forward 
in fiscal  however  the business found it necessary to hire and train a workforce to replace the workforce in the location being consolidated 
this resulted in increased headcount and inefficiencies in the manufacturing activities 
this business also undertook the relocation of manufacturing activities from our second mexico location to northern china  which resulted in cost increases due to travel 
the reduction in overhead costs and the lower operating costs associated with the move to china were expected to improve the performance of the electronics business in fiscal  especially in the second half of the year once all relocation activities have been completed 
during fiscal  our metal spinning and fabrication businesses experienced a modest decline in income from operations 
the decline is largely attributable to the favorable adjustment received in fiscal from the renegotiation of a long term supply contract with a major aerospace customer 
this decline was partially offset by improved margins within several core products for energy and aerospace industries 
this business continues to diversify with a focus on the general aviation and energy industries 
corporate operating expenses for corporate decreased million in fiscal  a decrease when compared to the same period one year earlier 
this decrease is largely the result of reductions in stock based compensation  professional fees and pension expenses 
the decrease in stock based compensation is due primarily to performance share units 
we have issued a number of restricted stock units which have performance criteria that determine the number of shares of stock to be issued at the end of each performance cycle 
we call these awards performance share units 
we account for these awards by using the fair value of the awards on the grant date and an estimate of the probability of the achievement of the performance criteria 
with the decline in performance for the company during fiscal  we determined that the achievement o f the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable  resulting in the reversal of any recognized compensation expense 
the net effect of this reversal to the current year expenses was a million reduction in stock based compensation at corporate 
operating expenses for corporate increased million in fiscal  a increase when compared to the same period one year earlier 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
r  which resulted in an increase in compensation expense associated with equity based compensation of  plus an additional  in compensation for awards issued to retirement eligible employees 
expenses for corporate were otherwise largely unchanged 
reductions in professional fees incurred in fiscal associated with the sarbanes oxley act were offset by executive search fees incurred 
discontinued operations in march  we entered into a plan to dispose of certain assets of our useco product lines 
useco  which was part of our food service equipment group  manufactures and sells rethermalization systems for meal deliveries to institutions  including governmental institutions  and under sink food disposals 
we determined that the product lines of useco did not strategically fit with the other products offered by the food service equipment group 
we also determined that the markets that this business serves are not growing 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we were able to complete the sale of the under sink food disposals product line resulting in a gain on the sale of approximately  which offset losses from the useco operations 
in the third quarter we determined that the remaining rethermalization systems business coul d not be sold 
we shutdown the operations  accelerating the depreciation expense on the remaining manufacturing equipment and ceasing the manufacturing operations 
any inventory remaining was analyzed and  where usable  transferred to our other businesses 
the remaining inventory was fully reserved for 
in connection with the shutdown  we retained the warranty risk for previously sold units 
we have analyzed those needs and believe that the current recorded balance of  is sufficient to cover future costs to support residual warranty claims 
in addition to the gain recognized on the sale of the under sink food disposals product line the results from discontinued operations during fiscal include the gains recognized upon the completion of the sales of the standard publishing and berean christian stores businesses 
standard publishing and berean christian stores were formerly part of the consumer products group 
during the quarter ended march   we announced our plan to sell the businesses in our consumer products group 
the businesses within the consumer products group were determined not to fit strategically with our other operating segments as these businesses have few synergies to leverage across the other segments 
we also determined that our capital resources could be better allocated among those businesses in our other operating segments that offers us opportun ities for growth 
in july  we sold substantially all the assets of the standard publishing business in an all cash deal 
we recognized a pre tax gain of million in this transaction 
in august  we sold substantially all the assets of the berean christian stores business in an all cash deal resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of  in connection with berean  we were party under a number of operating leases for existing stores and one closed store 
the store leases in this transaction were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the lease at the stated lease costs 
we recognized a liability of  representing the difference between the expected sub lease rental income and the rental costs for the store closed in connection with this sale 
the majority of the recent dispositions of businesses have been accomplished via asset sales 
as such  liabilities and contingencies such as workers compensation  product liability and environmental matters for properties not sold are retained by the company after the disposition 
the company can and does estimate those amounts and records the amount considered probable when incurred 
as of june   there were a number of open workers compensation claims  product liability claims and some environmental matters associated with operations which had been discontinued or sold through asset dispositions 
the company has recorded liabilities for these amounts and management does not believe that the outcome of these matters will be material to the financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company does not have any continuing involvement in any of these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from continuing operating activities and our revolving credit facility with nine banks 
continuing operations generated million in cash flow for the year ended june   compared to million in fiscal the increase is largely attributable to the continued focus on net working capital 
net working capital is defined as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable 
in  total net working capital increased million from the prior year level 
excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions  net working capital decreased  year over year 
discontinued operations used million of the cash generated by continuing operations  largely due to the payment of the taxes related to the gains realized from the disposition of the consu mer products group and shutdown costs associated with our discontinued operations 
we spent million in capital expenditures during and paid dividends of million 
we used the remaining cash flows from operations plus additional borrowings to fund the acquisitions of apw wyott and afs for million 
the sale of the remaining consumer group businesses generated million in proceeds while the sale of excess real estate generated million  the total of which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings by million 
in fiscal  continuing operations generated million of cash flow  compared to million in fiscal the increase is largely attributable to our decision to contribute million to the pension plans in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding pension contributions  cash flows from continuing operations decreased by million when comparing to the decrease is attributable to an increase in our working capital 
our net working capital increased million when compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to increases in receivables and inventory to support the higher sales volumes which were offset by the increase in accounts payable 
in addition  the sale of certain real estate generated million of incremental cash during the year while discontinued operation s generated million in cash primarily through the proceeds from the sale of standex direct of million 
we redeployed those resources by investing million in cash for capital expenditures  returning million to stockholders through dividends and using million in cash for acquisitions 
the expenditures for acquisitions were funded through a combination of borrowings and remaining cash flows from operating activities 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  operating lease payments  pension contributions  mandatory debt payments and dividends 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of any remaining cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
capital structure we have a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with nine participating banks 
proceeds under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
the agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness to ebitda 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate  plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of june   the effective rate of interest for outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
we are required to pay an annual fee of on the maximum credit line 
as of june  and  we had borrowings of million and million  respectively under the revo lving facilities 
available borrowings under the facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
at june   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the facility 
we also utilize money market credit facilities with two banks to help manage daily working capital needs 
the agreements  which expire annually  provide for a maximum aggregate credit line of million and are unsecured 
outstanding borrowings under the money market facilities reduce available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of june  and  we had  and  respectively  outstanding under these agreements 
at june  and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding for insurance purposes of million and million  respectively 
the company s long term debt also includes amounts associated with note purchase agreements with institutional investors 
as of june   we have two note purchase agreements with institutional investors of million each  dated october and october the notes bear interest at annual rates of and  respectively 
each note purchase agreement requires payment of interest semi annually 
the note purchase agreement dated october requires an annual payment of million commencing in october the note purchase agreement dated october is due and payable in october as of june  and  the balance outstanding under the note purchase agreements aggregated million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of the net income of million less the dividends paid of million less changes in the pension values  net of any tax benefit  of million and favorable foreign currency movements of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises in the current year 
the company s net debt to capital percentage increased to from  due to the increased borrowings to fund the recent acquisitions 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
additionally  sfas requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
as a result  we have included a million after tax charge in stockholders equity in fiscal to reflect the previously unrecognized actuarial losses under these plans 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an amount known as the additional minimum liability to equity 
the additional minimum liability was calculated based on the funded status of the plans at the end of the measurement period 
the after tax equity charge and the change year to year does not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
during fiscal  the retirement plans committee of the board of directors voted to freeze the pension benefits accruing under the salaried defined benefit plan and the supplemental defined benefit plan 
effective on january  all participants will no longer accrue any future benefits under the plans 
we expect that this action will reduce pension expenses by approximately million in there are no cash contribution requirements in for any of our defined benefit plans 
the company is also implementing an enhanced defined contribution plan in the us to supplement the freezing of the defined benefit plan 
the company expects the defined contribution plan to be implemented beginning on january  and the cost of this plan will offset a portion of the savings expected from the decision to freeze the defined benefit plan 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was million and million at june  and  respectively 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest payments post retirement benefit payments purchase obligations total estimated interest payments are based upon effective interest rates as of june  see item a for further discussions surrounding interest rate exposure on our variable rate borrowings 
post retirement benefit payments are based upon current benefit payment levels plus estimated health care costs trends of in the first year trending to through fiscal off balance sheet items in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
we are a guarantor under the initial remaining terms of each assigned lease  totaling million 
we do not expect to make any payments as a result of these guarantees 
we had no other material off balance sheet items at june  and at june   other than the operating lease and purchase obligations summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro and the british pound sterling pound 
during the current year  both these currencies have experienced increases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  and the pound has appreciated by relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters we are party to various claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to our business 
as explained more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality typically  the fourth quarter represents the best quarter for our consolidated financial results 
fourth quarter performance is generally enhanced by increased activity in the construction industry and activity in the food service equipment industry 
employee relations we maintain a solid working relationship with all of our unions and good employee relations are a focus of our management 
the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there were no work stoppages during fiscal year and a total of collective bargaining contracts covering employees will expire in fiscal although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill is not amortized  however  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  annually in the fourth quarter we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method and comparing that amount to the carrying value 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
the nature of the estimates made in projecting future cash flows could adversely affect the calculations made by us 
in addition  the estimate of fair value includes the use of a discount rate and a rate of future growth 
a basis point change in the discount rate used could resul t in an impairment of goodwill in our adp group 
a basis point change in the rate of future growth  independent of other variables  would not affect our analysis materially 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some post retirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our ex pected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a ten basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  per year 
a basis point decrease increase in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
additionally  sfas requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
as a result  we have included a million after tax charge in stockholders equity in fiscal to reflect the previously unrecognized actuarial losses under these plans 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an amount known as the additional minimum liability to equity 
the additional minimum liability was calculated based on the funded status of the plans at the end of the measurement period 
the after tax equity charge and the change year to year does not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
effective july   we changed our measurement date for our plans to june our fiscal expense will be measured based on assumptions as of june  we are electing to adopt the transition guidance of this standard by adjusting beginning retained earnings for the period between the old measurement date and the new measurement date in fiscal in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r reduced reported income and earnings per share by  in fiscal year we previously used the intrinsic value method as permitted by opinion no 
in prior periods 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for share purchase rights granted under our employee stock option and employee share purchase plans 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
interpretation no 
will be effective july  the company does not anticipate the adoption of fin will materially affect our financial position or result of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas becomes effective for us on july  upon adoption  the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits an entity to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilit ies 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods with those financial years 
at the effective date  an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date 
the entity shall report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this standard  but would not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  we mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june   we have no open foreign currency forward contracts 
at june  we had one open foreign currency forward contract  the fair value exposure of which was immaterial 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro and the british pound sterling 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at june  would not result in a material increase in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk is with the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  at june  and  we have no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the company also has million of long term debt and million of short term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with our long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
concentration of credit risk the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
in certain segments  some customers represent greater than of the segments revenues 
in the food service equipment group  seven customers account for approximately of annual sales 
in our engineered products segment  one aerospace customer accounts for approximately of segment annual revenues and one energy customer accounts for approximately of annual sales 
in many of our businesses our national accounts regularly review their selection of vendors 
although our companies have historically prevailed and even gained market share under these circumst ances  the outcome of future reviews can not be predicted 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortages 
prices for steel products have fluctuated over the last several fiscal years 
the adp  engineered products and food service equipment groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
during fiscal  we experienced price increases for a number of materials including copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
our affected divisions have generally implemented price increases intended on fully offsetting the increases in steel 
the implemented price increases in the food service equipment and engineered products group did not fully offset the higher material costs 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact o f material prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
