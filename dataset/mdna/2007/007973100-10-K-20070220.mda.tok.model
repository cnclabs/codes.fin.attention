business overview and presentation we design  manufacture and support complex power conversion and control systems and gas flow control devices used in plasma based  thin film processing equipment 
this equipment is essential to the manufacture of products including the following semiconductor devices for electronics applications  flat panel displays for hand held devices and computer and television screens  compact discs  dvds  magnetic hard drives and other digital storage media  solar panels or photovoltaics  optical coatings for eyeglasses  barrier coatings for architectural glass  industrial laser and medical applications  and other markets where thin film deposition is a critical part of the manufacturing process 
our vast installed base enables a recurring revenue opportunity as we sell spare parts  repair services and field upgrades worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
we provide solutions to a diverse range of markets and geographic regions 
however  we are focused on the semiconductor capital equipment industry and market and sell our products primarily to large  original equipment manufacturers oems in this industry 
sales to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry comprised of our sales in and of our sales in and our customers in non semiconductor industries are also large oem s that sell flat panel display  data storage  architectural glass  solar cell and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  including the notes thereto

years ended december  v v v v in thousands united states europe asia rest of world total sales years ended december  united states europe asia rest of world the increase in total sales from to and the decrease from to principally reflects fluctuations in demand in the semiconductor capital equipment 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
our sales to our largest semiconductor capital equipment customers represented the majority of the fluctuating sales volume 
applied materials is our largest customer and accounted for  and of our total sales  and  respectively 
our ten largest customers accounted for  and of our total sales in  and  respectively 
with the exception of applied materials and ulvac  inc  our largest customer in the flat panel display industry  accounting for of our sales in  no other customer exceeded of our sales during these annual periods 
gross profit our gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in our gross margin was attributed to increased volume of production and advanced manufacturing processes in our china manufacturing facility  lower freight costs  increased utilization of local asian suppliers  design led cost reductions and the increase in sales 
additionally  our gross margin in was positively impacted by our discontinuance of the allocation of human resource and finance department costs to cost of sales 
as part of our significant operational restructuring  we have reviewed all aspects of our management reporting and determined that the continued allocation of such costs was no longer appropriate 
in  these costs are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
human resource and finance department costs included in our gross margin represented percentage points in 
table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  of sales in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative litigation settlement restructuring charges impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development the market for our products for thin film deposition systems and related accessories is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new highly differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support oem requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
the increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased variable compensation and non cash stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r and additional research projects in response to customer requests and to support the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
the decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily due to less engineering support needed in connection with the transition of high volume product manufacturing to china  prioritization of our research and development projects and increased scrutiny of our costs 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  patent  tax  financial  corporate governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
the increase in our selling  general and administrative sg a expense from to was primarily due to increased variable compensation expense  increased commissions  non cash stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no r and severance and related expenses related to the reorganization of our operations in germany 
the decrease from to was due primarily to the benefit of our cost reduction measures and decreased commissions  partially offset by the increased allocation of certain costs from cost of sales to sg a expenses discussed above 
patent litigation expenses in and have comprised a portion of our sg a expenses 
in addition to the litigation settlement paid to mks instruments  inc mks as described below  we have recorded legal fees and expenses related to litigation with mks and others of approximately to of our total sg a expenses for each of the years ended december  and patent litigation expenses in comprised less than of our sg a expenses 
litigation settlement on october   we executed a settlement agreement with mks instruments  inc mks  resolving all pending claims worldwide relating to our xstream with active matching network reactive gas generator products 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we paid mks million in cash 
we also stipulated to a final judgment of infringement and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering to sell  or importing into the united states  or any country in which a counterpart patent exists  our xstream products and all other toroidal plasma generator products  except as permitted under the settlement agreement 
sales of these products have accounted for less than of our total sales each year since introduction of the products 
restructuring charges at the end of  we announced major changes in our operations planned to occur through these included establishing the manufacturing location in china  consolidating worldwide sales forces  a move to lower cost asian suppliers  and the intention to close or sell certain facilities 
associated with these changes  we recorded restructuring charges of  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents our restructuring charges throughout and were incurred primarily in conjunction with our transition of our high volume manufacturing to shenzhen  china  which was substantially complete as of september  in  we recorded million of restructuring charges  primarily attributable to employee severance and termination costs for employees in the fort collins facility 
related to this operations restructuring  and the transition of certain product lines from certain of our locations in europe and japan  we recorded restructuring charges in of million  consisting primarily of million for employee severance and termination costs and  for impairments of facilities related assets in the united states and japan  as a result of consolidation of certain of our facilities 
the employee severance and termination costs were associated with employees in the united states  employees in europe and three employees in japan 
as of december   all employee severance and termination costs have been paid and there is no remaining facility closing liability associated with those actions 
impairment of intangible assets we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter 
however  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we perform tests for impairment of these assets and record impairment charges  as necessary 
such events or circumstances include downturns or anticipated downturns in the industries in which we serve  changes in customer technology requirements  and other changes in circumstances affecting the underlying value of the recorded asset 
during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our financial forecasting for future periods  it was evident that projected cash flows from certain customers of the dressler product line were substantially below amounts previously projected 
the projected cash flows were considered in determining the fair value of certain contract based and other amortizable intangible assets recorded at acquisition and also in subsequent periods to assess such assets for potential impairment 
due to the decline in projected cash flows  we performed assessments of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets 
these assessments consisted of estimating the intangible asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value through the use of projected cash flows based upon projected revenue streams over the life of the asset  discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the respective carrying values  and recorded impairment charges of approximately million  which has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
also during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our restructuring plan  employees who were the subject of certain contract based amortizable intangibles left the company or their responsibilities were significantly altered 
as a result  we performed assessments of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets 
these assessments consisted of estimating the intangible asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the intangible asset s fair value through the use of a lost profits method of determining the fair value  arriving at projected cash flows which were then discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows 
based on this analysis we determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the respective carrying values  and recorded impairment charges of approximately  which has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
income from investments and cash was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in income from investments was primarily due to our higher level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities generated from operations and net proceeds from our public offering of million shares 
this was offset in by our use of those proceeds to redeem our convertible subordinated notes in september interest expense consisted principally of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  on borrowings under capital lease facilities and senior debt  and amortization of our deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense was approximately  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in september our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency loss of  in and a net foreign currency gain of  and million in and  respectively 
debt extinguishment expense of million in resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million 
the expense of million is comprised of million for redemption premium and million for the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
net other income expense consists principally of miscellaneous gains and losses  including gains and losses on the sale of investments and impairments of investments 

table of contents provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
since  we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have incurred significant losses 
given such experience  prior to december   management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
based on our operating results  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 evaluated the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of net deferred tax assets would be realized and recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately million at december  the reduction in the valuation allowance was million for the entire year 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those difference become deductible the timing and amount of which is uncertain 
approximately million of net deferred tax assets at december  related to certain us net operating losses that are subject to limitations under the us tax code 
these assets continue to have a full valuation allowance as management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
additionally  approximately million of the december  valuation allowance relates to the benefit from stock based compensation 
any reversal of valuation allowance from this item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
please refer to note income taxes included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding income taxes 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of our remaining net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
the income tax benefit of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
this negative rate includes the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the income tax provision of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of and the income tax provision of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of negative  due to taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the company s income from discontinued operations earned in prior periods was earned in the united states 
no provision for income taxes is attributed to these discontinued operations  due to the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the united states that existed in those periods  including those generated by net operating losses 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
at december   approximately million of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets obtained through acquisition 
any reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
for the year ended december   million of valuation allowances established in purchase accounting were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we sold the assets of our emco product line and our ikor product line  as they were not critical to our core operations 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the emco product line of million and a gain on the sale of the ikor product line of million 
because the emco product line has not represented a significant portion of our operations  with revenues representing of annual consolidated sales in and through its sale on june   and represents an insignificant portion of our operating results for all periods presented  we have not reclassified the results of operations of the emco product line to income from discontinued operations 
the results of operations of the ikor product line have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations  which results include income of million and million in and  respectively 
no provision for income taxes is attributed to these operations due to the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the united states  as the income from our discontinued operations was earned in the united states 
in the second quarter of   held in escrow relating to the emco product line was released and in the forth quarter of  million held in escrow relating to the ikor product line was released as various contingencies were resolved 
these amounts were recorded as gains on the sale of discontinued assets 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding at december  borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement are limited based upon letters of credit outstanding under this agreement and the lenders borrowing base calculation  which considers among other factors  our accounts receivable and inventory balances 
advances under the revolving line of credit would bear interest at the prime rate at february  minus 
any advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in july we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  net worth  acquisitions and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  we have historically financed our operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  the issuance of long term debt and common stock  bank loans  capital lease obligations and operating leases 
during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million  or  to million from million at december   primarily due to cash generated from our operations 
during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes for million  offset by the million of net proceeds from our public offering of million shares of common stock and million of net cash provided by operating activities 
operating activities provided cash of million and million in the increase in cash generated from operations is primarily attributed to our increased profitability in operating activities used cash of million in primarily due to working capital changes 
investing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in due to the significant cash generated from operations  in we purchased million of marketable securities  compared to purchases of million and sales of million of marketable securities used to redeem a portion of the convertible subordinated notes in capital expenditures in were million  compared to capital expenditures of million in cash provided by investing activities in also reflects million received on the sale of our ikor product line and million on the sale of our emco product line 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which primarily consisted of million from proceeds on the net sale of marketable securities  offset by million for the purchase of property and equipment 
with the significant capital expenditures related to our investment in our manufacturing operations as well as our information technology infrastructure  we expect to increase our capital expenditures in to approximately million 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions as our business experiences sudden changes 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly impact our capital expenditures in a particular period 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we 
table of contents convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our current operations  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
financing activities used cash of  in  due primarily to million in payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes offset in part by our public offering of common stock 
during the third quarter of  we raised million in net proceeds from a public offering of million shares of common stock 
with these proceeds we fully redeemed the convertible subordinated notes due november  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment   for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
after the redemption of the convertible subordinate notes  proceeds of approximately million remained 
these proceeds together with approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were used to redeem the convertible subordinated notes due september  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment  million for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
financing activities used cash of million in  which primarily consisted of payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and in proceeds of a senior borrowing used to purchase a building in south korea 
we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our payments under capital lease obligations and other borrowings may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or change the level of our bank financing 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet liabilities primarily consist of lease payment obligations incurred under operating leases 
the following table sets forth our future payments due under operating lease obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands thereafter total operating lease obligations other commitments as of december  include million in non cancelable purchase order obligations related primarily to inventory purchases 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in in the normal course of business 
please refer to note commitments and contingencies included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
we believe that our working capital  together with cash anticipated to be generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes under part ii  item of this form k and believe that our accounting policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  are most critical as they relate to our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our standard shipping term is free on board fob shipping point  for which revenue is recognized upon shipment of its products  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for certain customers  we have fob destination terms  for which revenue is recognized upon receipt of the products by the customer  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contracts that contain certain customer acceptance provisions are deferred until customer acceptance occurs 
generally  we do not have obligations to our customers after its products are shipped under fob shipping point terms  after its products are received by customers under fob destination terms  and after the products are accepted by customers under contractual acceptance provisions  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in limited instances  we provide installation of our products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item  generally the product  and the undelivered item  installation  based on their respective fair values 
revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed 
in certain instances  we require our customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to building or shipping these products 
cash payments received prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheets  and then recognized as revenue as appropriate based upon the transfer of title of the products 

table of contents we do not offer price protections to its customers or allow returns  unless covered by its normal policy for repair of defective products 
warranty policy we offer warranty coverage for our products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical cost of the repairs  adjusted for inflation  and expected failure rates 
unanticipated product failures or exceptional product performance can result in changes to our future liability 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally due to engineering changes to a product  discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable value of inventory 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded  as necessary  within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
we analyze both forecasted and historical demand on a quarterly basis 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r to account for our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in the statement of operations 
the fair value of stock options and purchase rights pursuant the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected life of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based upon our closing stock price on the grant date 
the fair value of stock based awards is amortized over the requisite service period  typically the vesting period  of the award on a straight line basis 
commitments and contingencies from time to time we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business see item within part i and note within part ii  item 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies  including litigation  when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the tax rates expected in the period that the assets or liabilities are realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and income projections for each jurisdiction 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that it will realize a portion or all of its remaining net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to periodic at least annual tests for impairment 
for the periods presented  we did not have any indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i we assess goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit with the carrying value  and ii if potential impairment is indicated because the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year beginning january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin no 
and at this time have not determined what the impact will be 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and early application is encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

among other items  fas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity s defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements  requires the measurement of defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and requires recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
fas is effective for fiscal years ending after december   and early application is encouraged 
the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and institutional money markets 
these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
we 
table of contents believe that a decrease in average interest rates on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we have entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  south korean won and chinese yuan 
the notional amount of our foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to the underlying assets 
at december  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts  maturing through january  primarily to purchase us dollars and sell various foreign currencies
