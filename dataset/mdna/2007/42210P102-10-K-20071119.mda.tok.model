item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we made one acquisition in and several insignificant acquisitions in these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with our results  their operations up to the dates of acquisition have not been included in the consolidated results for any period 
we currently operate in three industries construction materials  coal combustion products ccps and alternative energy 
in the construction materials segment  we design  manufacture  and sell architectural stone and resin based exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents and other products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
we are a nationwide leader in the management and marketing of ccps 
revenues in the ccp segment consist primarily of fly ash and other product sales 
in the alternative energy segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
revenues for the alternative energy segment consist primarily of sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
operations and strategy 
during the past several years  we have executed our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying from over reliance on the legacy alternative energy segment section k formerly section business 
with the addition and expansion of our ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions in and in  and the growth of our construction materials business  through several large and small acquisitions in  and  we have achieved revenue growth and diversification in three business segments 
because we also incurred increased indebtedness to make strategic acquisitions  one of our ongoing financial objectives is to continue to focus on increased cash flows to reduce debt 
a material amount of our and prior fiscal year consolidated revenue and net income has been derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which depend on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generates tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code 
we have also claimed section k tax credits for synthetic fuel sales from facilities in which we own an interest 
the following issues exist related to tax credits 
by law  section k tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expire for synthetic fuel sold after december  when section k expires  we expect our licensees synthetic fuel facilities to close because we do not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
when our licensees close their facilities or significantly reduce production activities  it will have a material adverse effect on our revenue  net income and cash flow  in addition to the current material adverse effect caused by phase out concerns 
section k tax credits are subject to phase out after the average annual us wellhead oil price reference price reaches a beginning phase out threshold price  and are eliminated entirely if the reference price reaches the full phase out price 
there was a partial phase out of tax credits for calendar of approximately and 
table of contents we currently expect a significant phase out of tax credits for calendar most of our licensees stopped production for a period of time in calendar as of september   all of our licensees were producing synthetic fuel  but some have indicated intent to stop production prior to december  these events have materially adversely affected both the amount and timing of recognition of our revenue  net income and cash flow in and  and will likely have a material adverse effect in  until section k expires at the end of calendar and the calendar reference price and phase out range are published in the quarter ending june  reference is made to notes and to the consolidated financial statements where there is more information on phase out and other uncertainties related to section k tax credits that have affected our business historically and that will continue to affect our business in our acquisition strategy targets businesses that are leading players in their respective industries and that enjoy healthy operating margins  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of our existing businesses 
in addition  in  we began to acquire small companies with innovative products that can be marketed using our existing distribution channels 
we are also committed to continuing to invest in research and development activities that are focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology 
we participate in joint ventures which operate an ethanol plant located in north dakota and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea 
we are also investing in other alternative energy projects such as coal cleaning and the use of nanocatalysts to engineer coal for emissions reduction and to enhance the refining of heavy crude oils into lighter transportation fuels 
our ccps and construction materials businesses are affected by seasonality  with the highest revenue and profitability produced in the june and september quarters 
with ccps  our strategy is to continue to negotiate long term contracts so that we can invest in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
we also intend to continue our efforts to expand usage of high value ccps  develop more uses for lower value ccps  such as blending  and expand the use of ccps in our construction materials businesses 
in and  we focused on the integration of our large acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse construction materials products through our national distribution network 
we became highly leveraged as a result of those acquisitions  but have reduced our outstanding debt since that time through cash generated from operations  from an underwritten public offering of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
we intend to continue to focus on repaying long term debt while continuing to look for diversification opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
we currently license our technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the us license agreements contain a quarterly earned royalty fee generally set at a prescribed dollar amount per ton or a percentage of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
recurring license 
table of contents fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which coincides with the sale of alternative fuel by our licensees  provided standard revenue recognition criteria such as amounts being fixed or determinable are met 
in most instances  we receive timely reports from licensees notifying us of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due us under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  we have experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees with whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information available to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  we use such information as is available and where possible  substantiate the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  we are unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
in  we entered into an agreement with ajg financial services  inc the agreement provided for ajg to pay royalties and allowed ajg to purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from us 
in october  we filed a complaint in the fourth district court for the state of utah against ajg alleging that it had failed to make payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement 
we asserted claims including breach of contract and sought money damages as well as other relief 
ajg s answer to the complaint denied our claims and asserted counter claims based upon allegations of misrepresentation and breach of contract 
this litigation came to the trial phase in january the jury reached a verdict substantially in our favor and the court entered a judgment for us against ajg in the amount of approximately million which included approximately million in prejudgment interest 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with ajg which provided for payments to us in the amount of million at the time of settlement which payment was received in may  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for the first three quarters of calendar year were received in january  with all other quarterly payments for through payable days after the end of each quarter 
payments based upon tax credits for through are subject to downward adjustment or elimination if a phase out of section tax credits occurs due to high oil prices 
we recognized the million contract litigation settlement gain  net of payments due to a third party  as a reduction in operating costs and expenses in the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through the ongoing quarterly payments based upon tax credits are being recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  we also recognized approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all of which related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
the amount of license fee revenue recognized during and was negatively affected by reduced revenues being recognized for certain licensees whose license agreements call for us to be paid a portion of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
therefore  due to uncertainties related to phase out of section k tax credits and other licensee specific factors  the timing of revenue recognition was delayed for certain licensees during fiscal and 
table of contents due to publication of the section k calendar reference price and the phase out range  finalization of calendar phase out was made possible during the quarter ended june  as a result of the availability of this information and the clarification of other licensee specific factors  certain calendar and prior year license fee revenue totaling approximately million was recognized in this amount related to periods ending on or prior to december  and was recognized in when it met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in the future 
we have applied the same policy in with regard to the recognition of revenue for calendar tax credit based license fees 
the final determination of revenue to be collected pertaining to fiscal and calendar year will not occur until the calendar reference price and phase out range are published in the quarter ending june  income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments were required in the calculation of our income tax provisions for the years presented  most particularly in and one of the key estimates affecting our and tax provisions is the amount of section k formerly section tax credits that will ultimately be available related to our interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility  plus two other smaller alternative fuel facilities that we own and operate see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calendar section k tax credit phase out percentage was not finalized until the quarter ended june  the calendar phase out percentage will not be finalized until the quarter ending june  as of september   an estimated phase out percentage of is our best estimate of what the phase out percentage for calendar would be  using available information as of that date 
it is certain that the phase out percentage for calendar will be different from this estimate 
as of october   the estimated phase out percentage for calendar would be 
we estimate that nymex average oil prices would need to exceed for the period october  through december  for full phase out to occur in calendar the effect of the finalization of the calendar phase out percentage  which was published in  was a decrease in income tax expense of approximately million which amount was included in the tax provision 
likewise  the effect on income taxes of the change in the calendar phase out percentage from to the actual percentage for the year will be recorded to income tax expense in fiscal  when the calendar actual oil prices and the phase out range are known 
the effect of this adjustment could be material to our income tax expense 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes and therefore had a significant negative effect on our reported effective tax rate for as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  approximately million of stock based compensation in resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for the grant date fair value that had not been recognized as of the cancellation dates 
as a result of the cancellation of the stock based awards  approximately million of deferred tax assets were written off 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to adopt interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin at the beginning of our fiscal year  or october   with a transition adjustment to retained earnings as of october   if material 
based upon our evaluation as of september   the cumulative effect of adopting fin could be a decrease in retained earnings and an increase in income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions of approximately million  however  this amount is subject to revision when we complete our evaluation 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax 
table of contents jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer probable or necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
these intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  all of which relates to acquisitions that occurred from through sfas no 
requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment at least annually  or more frequently if evidence of possible impairment arises 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of june  using the two step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of june   there were five distinguishable reporting units with goodwill  three of which were in the construction materials segment 
there was one reporting unit with goodwill in each of the ccps and alternative energy segments 
as a result of ongoing changes in the operations and management of the businesses in the construction materials segment  and in accordance with the requirements contained in sfas no 
 sfas no 
and eitf abstract topic d  clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of sfas no 
 we expect goodwill in the three historical reporting units in this segment will be aggregated and tested for impairment as one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing in with the exception of the tapco reporting unit for  all of the step tests indicated that the fair values of the reporting units  calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows  exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed for those reporting units  and no impairment charges were necessary 
as a result of the depressed residential housing and remodeling market and changes in cost of capital  the tapco reporting unit failed step  requiring completion of step  which resulted in a determination that tapco s goodwill was impaired 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the impairment did not affect our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or senior debt covenants  and will not have any impact on future operations 
in addition to the annual review  we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful lives  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on 
table of contents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance indicators  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
in  the construction materials segment revised downward the estimated useful lives of certain assets resulting in accelerated depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over shorter periods 
this is the primary reason for the increased depreciation expense in as compared to and in as compared to it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that resulting write downs could be material 
stock based compensation 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we early adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation required by sfas no 
r  effective as of october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
most of the stock based compensation resulted from the expense associated with grants of immediate vested sars and from the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options 
approximately million of the stock based compensation resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for the grant date fair value that had not been recognized as of the cancellation dates 
we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of stock based awards for all awards expected to vest  over the period during which the related service is rendered by grantees 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined primarily using the black scholes merton option pricing model b s m model  developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of certain subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
for stock based awards  we use the graded vesting or accelerated method to allocate compensation expense over the requisite service periods 
our estimated forfeiture rates are based largely on historical data and ranged from to from to  depending on the type of award and the award recipients 
as of september   the estimated forfeiture rate for most unvested awards was per year 
the fair values of stock options and sars were estimated using the b s m model  adjusted where necessary to account for specific terms of awards that the b s m model does not have the capability to consider 
we used the services of an independent valuation firm to validate our fair value estimates and assumptions and also to determine certain necessary adjustments to the b s m model output 
one such adjustment was used in determining the fair value of sars which had a cap on allowed appreciation 
for those sars  the output determined by the b s m model was reduced by an amount determined by a quasi monte carlo simulation to reflect the reduction in fair value associated with the appreciation cap 
expected stock price volatility was estimated using primarily historical volatilities of our common stock 
implied volatilities of traded options on our stock  volatility predicted by a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model  and an analysis of volatilities used by other public companies in comparable lines of business were also considered 
risk free interest rates used were the us treasury bond yields with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the awards being valued 
in estimating expected lives  we considered the contractual and vesting terms of awards  along with historical experience  however  due to insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives  we used estimates based on the simplified method set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 where expected life is estimated by summing the award s vesting term and the contractual term and dividing that result by two 
the reduction in value related to grantee payment for certain immediate vested sars was estimated by management based on the terms of the payment requirements and other factors 
as of september   there was approximately million of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a 
table of contents weighted average period of approximately years 
due to the grant of stock based awards subsequent to september   the amount of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards has increased  and the weighted average period over which compensation cost will be recognized has changed 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  combined with the settlement of the ajg litigation described above  was a contributing factor in our decision to grant employee incentive awards in  in particular to grant fewer options and more sars  including many that vested immediately  the granting of performance based awards  and the acceleration of vesting of stock options 
the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards in was a direct result of the low stock price as compared to the exercise prices of the cancelled sars 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by approximately to billion as compared to billion for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the decrease in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to the effects of a depressed residential housing and remodeling market which impacted sales across most of our product lines 
the housing market slowdown also was the primary reason for the decline in gross margin percentage from to because a substantial amount of our revenues in this segment are dependent on the housing market  we anticipate continuing impact in from the current slowdown in the housing industry 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues and in the gross margin percentage during were due primarily to a combination of continued strong demand for ccps and upward pricing trends in most concrete markets 
the growth in demand for ccps is due in part to certain regional shortages of portland cement for which ccps are a substitute 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
alternative energy segment 
our alternative energy segment revenue consists primarily of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies  and to a lesser extent  sales of synthetic fuel from two solid alternative fuel production facilities that we own 
the major components of revenue for the alternative energy segment are discussed in the sections below 
as described previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements  a material amount of our and prior fiscal year consolidated revenue has been derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which depend on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generates tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code 
by law  section k tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expire for synthetic fuel sold after december  when section k expires  we expect our licensees synthetic fuel facilities to close because we do not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
when our licensees close their facilities or significantly reduce production activities  it will have a material adverse effect on our revenue  in addition to the current material adverse effect caused by phase out concerns 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding 
table of contents direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales in were higher than in primarily due to increased synthetic fuel production by most of our licensees resulting in increased sales of million and other customers with whom we do not have a license agreement resulting in increased sales of million 
we believe there has been less concern in over phase out of section k tax credits than existed in  due partly to mitigation efforts such as hedging  which has resulted in increased synthetic fuel production 
the gross margin percentage for of was lower than the gross margin percentage of due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn was related to increases in the costs of petroleum based materials 
license fees 
during  we recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million from million of license fee revenue recognized during the amount of license fee revenue recognized during and was negatively affected by reduced revenues being recognized for certain licensees whose license agreements call for us to be paid a portion of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
due to uncertainties related to phase out and other licensee specific factors  revenue recognition was deferred for certain licensees during fiscal and due to publication of the calendar reference price and the phase out range for that year  finalization of calendar phase out was made possible during the quarter ended june  as a result of the availability of this information and the clarification of other licensee specific factors  certain calendar and prior year license fee revenue totaling approximately million was recognized in this amount related to periods ending on or prior to december  and was recognized in when it met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in the future 
we have applied the same policy in with regard to the recognition of revenue for calendar tax credit based license fees 
the final determination of revenue to be collected pertaining to fiscal and calendar year will not occur until the calendar reference price and phase out range are published in the quarter ending june  reference is made to our policy disclosures discussed previously 
other alternative energy segment revenues 
the majority of other alternative energy segment revenue is comprised of sales of synthetic fuel  which during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
revenue from the sale of synthetic fuel has a negative gross margin  which is more than compensated for by the income tax credits expected to be earned from the sales of the synthetic fuel 
amortization and research and development expenses 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to intangible assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expense increased by million from to primarily because of increased spending in our joint research efforts with evonik industries ag formally degussa ag related to hydrogen peroxide and in developmental efforts related to our nanotechnologies 
both amortization and research and development expenses are currently expected to decrease somewhat in from the reported amounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in payroll and incentive pay at the operating business unit level  a million increase in litigation related costs  and a million increase in stock based compensation 
a majority of the increase in payroll costs relates to growth initiatives at the operating business unit level  and increased incentive pay related to improved performance at certain operating business units 
the increase in litigation costs was due to a net credit recorded in because of positive developments in certain legal matters 
those developments resulted in reduced likelihood of ultimate legal liability and the reversal of previously expensed litigation costs 
the higher stock based compensation was due to the cancellation of sars and other stock based awards in and the resultant acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 
other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was comprised of a decrease in net 
table of contents interest expense of million and an increase in other expenses of million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to the lower interest rate on the million of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in  and lower average levels of long term debt in as compared to the decrease in interest expense caused by those factors was partially offset by million of accelerated amortization of debt issue costs related to early repayments of senior debt in  a majority of which were funded by net proceeds from the new lower rate convertible notes 
we currently expect interest expense in to be somewhat less than the amount 
the increase in other expenses of million consisted primarily of an increase in costs related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax provision 
we recorded income tax provisions with an effective tax rate of approximately in and in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  which is not tax deductible 
the effective tax rates are lower than statutory rates primarily due to tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we own and operate  plus our interest in an entity that owns and operates another alternative fuel facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section k formerly section of the internal revenue code  subject to the uncertainties of phase out  irs audit and other risks associated with the tax credits  all as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the tax credits in both years and the goodwill impairment charge in  our effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
as discussed in note  the section k tax credits used in calculating the income tax provision are estimated as of september  while the calendar phase out percentage can not be finalized at the current time  as of september   the estimated phase out percentage of represents our best estimate of what the phase out percentage would be  using available information as of that date 
the effect on income taxes of any change in the calendar phase out percentage from to the actual percentage for the year will be recorded to income tax expense in subsequent periods  when the calendar actual oil prices and the phase out range are known 
any such effect could be material to our income tax expense 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by approximately to billion as compared to billion for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to increases in volume  which occurred across all major product lines  with a lesser impact from price increases related to passing on to customers a portion of raw material cost increases 
the primary reasons for the decline in gross margin percentage from to were acceleration of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate certain assets over shorter estimated useful lives  additional operating costs as production levels were managed downward to account for the downturn in the residential housing market and higher raw material costs  only a portion of which were passed on to customers 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the 
table of contents increase in ccp revenues and in the gross margin percentage during were due primarily to a combination of continued strong demand for ccps  upward pricing trends in most concrete markets  and increased project revenues 
in addition  weather conditions in the south central region of the united states have generally been favorable in the growth in demand for ccps is due in part to certain regional shortages of portland cement for which ccps are a substitute  which can result in an increased percentage of ccps being used in concrete 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
alternative energy segment 
the major components of revenue for the alternative energy segment are discussed in the sections below 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the decrease in chemical reagent sales during was due to decreased synthetic fuel production by our licensees resulting in decreased sales of million  and by customers with whom we do not have a license agreement resulting in decreased sales of million 
the primary reason for decreased synthetic fuel production in was the potential for significant phase out of section k tax credits  resulting in licensees and other customers stopping or significantly curtailing production for a period of time during the gross margin percentage for of was lower than s gross margin percentage of due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn is related to increases in the costs of petroleum based materials 
license fees 
during  we recognized license fee revenue totaling million  a decrease of million or from million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reason for the decrease in license fee revenue in compared to related to significantly reduced revenues being recognized for several licensees whose license agreements call for us to be paid a portion of the value of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
because the calendar phase out percentage for section k tax credits could not be finalized as of september   only approximately million of revenues for these licensees was recognized for the nine months ended september  the amount recognized met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in the future 
additional revenues for these licensees was dependent on the calendar phase out percentage of section k  which was not finalized until other alternative energy segment revenues 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of synthetic fuel from to was due to the synthetic fuel facilities starting operations in spring amortization and research and development expenses 
there were no material changes in either amortization or research and development expenses from to selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses decreased million  or to million for from million for the decrease in was due primarily to significant one time stock based compensation costs in related to the implementation in of sfas no 
r million 
offsetting this decrease was a million increase in marketing expense related to efforts in the construction materials segment to increase awareness and sales of new products 
contract litigation settlement 
in  we settled our litigation with ajg 
in connection with the litigation settlement  a payment of million was received in this amount  net of payments due to a third party and less the amount recognized as a reimbursement of legal fees approximately million  was reflected as a reduction in operating costs and expenses 
other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to a decrease in net 
table of contents interest expense of million and a decrease in other expenses of million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to significantly lower average levels of long term debt in compared to the decrease in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a decrease in costs of approximately million related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary reason for decreased costs for this facility was related to the estimated phase out percentage for section k tax credits for calendar of approximately 
partially offsetting the decrease in costs related to our investment in the alternative fuel facility was an increase of million in charges primarily related to a joint venture investment and the disposition of property  plant and equipment 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision for both and resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 
the low effective tax rate for both years is primarily due to tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we own and operate  plus our interest in an entity that owns and operates another alternative fuel facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the tax credits  our estimated effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
impact of inflation and related matters in addition to the effects of rising oil prices as discussed elsewhere  our operations have been impacted by i increased cement  polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride costs in the construction materials segment  ii rising costs for chemical reagents in the alternative energy segment  iii increased fuel costs that have affected transportation costs in most of our business units  and iv certain regional shortages of cement and aggregate materials 
the increased costs of polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride  chemical reagents and fuel are directly related to the increase in prices of oil and other petroleum based materials 
the increased costs of cement appear to be caused by a lack of adequate supplies in some regions of the us and international supply  demand and transportation costs 
we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  of the increased material and transportation costs to customers 
it is not possible to predict the future trend of material and transportation costs  nor our ability to pass on any future price increases to customers 
it is also not possible to predict the impact of potential future cement supply shortages on our ability to procure needed supplies in our construction materials business 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was million compared to million for the year ended september  
the primary reason for the change in cash provided by operations from to was the collection in of a million receivable related to the litigation settlement reached with ajg in  along with other changes in working capital 
in and  the primary investing activities consisted of payments for acquisitions  the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and investments in joint ventures 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of the issuance of a new series of convertible senior subordinated notes and the early repayment of a portion of our senior debt 
in  the primary financing activity consisted of repayments of long term debt 
more details about our investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
total expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were not materially different from most of the capital expenditures in both periods were incurred by the construction materials segment  however  in  a higher proportion of total capital expenditures were incurred by the alternative energy segment as compared to a significant portion of our planned future capital expenditures  which in 
table of contents are currently expected to exceed the amount  represent expansion of operations  rather than maintenance of operating capacity  primarily due to growth initiatives in the alternative energy segment 
capital expenditures are limited by our senior debt covenants to million annually  however  the cumulative unused amounts of annual capital expenditures limits can be carried forward and used in subsequent years 
as of september   we had approximately million of unused amounts of capital expenditures from prior years and we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion  primarily in the alternative energy segment 
in  we acquired of the ownership interests of a privately held company in the construction materials business 
total consideration paid at the date of acquisition of approximately million consisted primarily of cash 
an additional amount  currently estimated to be approximately million  is payable in the future  based on earnings of the acquired entity for the month period ended september  that exceed an agreed upon threshold 
during  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several privately held companies in the construction materials industry 
total consideration paid or accrued for these acquisitions was less than million 
pursuant to contractual terms for some of the acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march if future earn out consideration is paid in excess of amounts accrued for any acquisition  goodwill will be increased accordingly 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform 
acquisitions are an important part of our business strategy and to that end  we routinely review potential complementary acquisitions  including those in the areas of construction materials  ccp marketing  and coal and catalyst technologies 
it is possible that some portion of future cash and cash equivalents and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt will be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses in the chemical  energy  building products and related industries 
the senior secured credit agreement limits acquisitions in the aggregate to million of cash consideration and million of non cash consideration annually  with no more than million of cash consideration for any one acquisition  unless our total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  after giving effect to an acquisition  in which case the foregoing limitations do not apply 
the senior secured credit agreement also limits the amount we can invest in joint ventures and other less than owned entities 
we have invested in several joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  but do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in those entities 
financing activities 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of the repayment of long term debt 
in  as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due february substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately million  along with million of available cash  were used to repay million of senior debt and the remaining balance approximately million of notes payable to a bank 
subsequently  we repaid an additional million of senior debt 
in  we also paid approximately million for the convertible note hedge and related warrants associated with the issuance of the convertible debt 
as of september   we have no long term debt repayments that are due prior to we may  in the future  make optional prepayments of the senior debt depending on actual cash flows  our current and expected cash requirements and other applicable factors we deem to be significant 
due to covenants associated with our senior debt  we currently have restrictions on our ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  we have historically experienced strong positive cash flow from operations which has enabled us to repay a substantial amount of our long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
we expect our positive cash flow to continue in the future in addition to our ability to access the equity markets if necessary 

table of contents in january  we announced that we were planning an exchange offer for our convertible senior subordinated notes due  whereby new notes with similar  but not identical  terms  along with an exchange fee  would be issued upon tender of the existing notes 
in april  we announced that the commencement of an exchange offer had been indefinitely postponed 
we continue to evaluate the merits of an exchange offer 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information about our outstanding long term debt  interest rate hedges  and compliance with debt covenants  as well as the available million revolving credit arrangement 
subject to obtaining additional revolving loan commitments  we can increase the revolving credit limit to million 
the senior credit facility contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset sales and liens  annual capital expenditures in excess of million annually  and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  we must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases totaled million  compared to million in option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts  reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were not material in or in october  we announced that our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
the purchases will be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
the extent to which we repurchase our common shares and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors  including our stock price  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 
working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million 
notwithstanding the expiration of section k tax credits as of december  and the resulting impact on cash flow  we expect operations to produce positive cash flow in future periods and believe working capital  along with available borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement  will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months 
income taxes 
our cash requirements for income taxes generally approximate the income tax provision  however  there is usually some lag in paying estimated taxes during a fiscal year due to the seasonality of our operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s income based on year to date results 
there is also some lag in realizing the cash benefits from the utilization of tax credits due to the interaction of our september fiscal year end and the different fiscal year ends of the entities through which we receive the tax credits 
in and  there has been more variability in the relationship between the income tax provision and income tax payments because the tax provision calculation is materially dependent upon the estimated phase out percentage of section k tax credits see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the calendar phase out percentage is subject to material change because it is dependent on oil prices for all of calendar  which are not predictable 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which amount was not material in option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price which is not predictable  and likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash uses  in addition to operational working capital requirements  including income tax payments  are currently expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service payments on outstanding long term debt 

table of contents legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  but otherwise do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured debt convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations capital expenditures acquisition related liabilities other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our senior debt credit facility provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit arrangement  with the ability to increase this amount to million  subject to obtaining additional revolving loan commitments 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement as of september   or subsequent thereto 
the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   six stand by letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from march to september during  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several privately held companies in the construction materials industry 
total consideration paid or accrued for these acquisitions was less than million 
pursuant to contractual terms for some of the acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march in  we acquired of the ownership interests of a privately held company in the construction materials business 
total consideration paid at the date of acquisition  of approximately million  consisted primarily of cash 
an additional amount  currently estimated to be in excess of million  is payable in the future  based on earnings of the acquired entity for the month period ended september  that exceed an agreed upon threshold 
reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under 
table of contents employment agreements  long term incentive cash bonus awards  change in control agreements  performance unit awards  and a contingent commission agreement 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of these agreements  depending upon the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
in  we incurred approximately million of expense for legal matters  which consisted primarily of costs for outside legal counsel 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability 
it is not possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require us to incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
recent accounting pronouncements reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been recently issued which we have not yet adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  but have entered into certain hedge transactions  primarily to limit our variable interest rate exposure 
the blue flint joint venture also has hedges in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  our senior debt  totaling million as of september   bears interest at a variable rate 
as required by the senior secured credit facility  we entered into agreements to limit our variable interest rate exposure through september  the agreements effectively fix the libor rate at for million of this debt 
we accounted for these agreements as cash flow hedges  with their fair market value reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities 
the market value of all cash flow hedges at september  was not material 
total comprehensive income  considering all cash flow hedge agreements in which we are or were a party  was not materially different from net income for any period 
considering our current balance of variable rate debt  a change in the interest rate of would change our interest expense by approximately million during the months ending september
