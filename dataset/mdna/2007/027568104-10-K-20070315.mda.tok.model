as a result  these charges have been recorded in impairment losses on investments on our consolidated statements of income 
there were no such losses recognized in the and periods 
during  we entered into fair value swaps to which we do not apply hedge accounting 
as a result  changes in the market value of these derivatives have been recorded as gains and losses in other income on our consolidated statements of income 
there were no such gains or losses recorded in prior comparable periods 
during august  we sold our membership interests in arcap  resulting in a significant gain on the sale  as well as additional equity income recognized from a special distribution prior to the sale  while eliminating any further equity income 
prior comparable periods  included equity income from the investment and included a conversion premium for when we converted a portion of our preferred membership units to common units 
during  we sold twenty debt securities  resulting in a reduction of net income from impairment charges recorded  as well as the recognition of a loss on the sale 
there were no such losses or impairments recorded in prior comparable periods 
during march  we issued million of floating rate preferred securities through a subsidiary 
due to the mandatory redemption feature of these securities  the payments or accruals of dividends and other amounts to be paid to the holders of these securities are reported as interest costs 
as a result  these interest costs are classified as interest distributions to preferred shareholders of subsidiary subject to mandatory repurchase 
there were no such interest costs in periods prior to during september  the gnma certificate and mezzanine loan investments relating to one property were repaid prior to its maturity date 
this pay off resulted in significantly higher levels of fees earned and gain on redemption

interest income from mortgage loans increased significantly in and due to the funding of first mortgage loans  bridge notes  mezzanine loans  and subordinated b notes in  as well as the funding of three mezzanine loans during the second half of and seven mezzanine loans during the decrease in the weighted average interest rates on mortgage loans during was due to a large portion of investments made in the form of first mortgage loans  which are significantly lower yielding than the mezzanine loan investments we acquired in interest income from debt securities decreased during  primarily due to the sale of fnma certificates in november  as well as the payoff of three gnma certificates during the year 
the increase in the weighted average interest rate on debt securities during is due to the lower yields of the fnma certificates sold relative to the yields of those retained 
during  interest income from debt securities increased because of the funding of various fnma certificates during the latter half of and during  which were lower yielding debt securities than the ones we previously held  thus decreasing the weighted average interest rate 
interest income from notes receivable decreased during both and  primarily due to the payoff of several notes during these periods  as well as three loans which defaulted in interest income from revenue bonds decreased during both and primarily due to the payoff of two revenue bonds in and two others in the latter half of interest income from temporary investments increased during and primarily due to excess cash on hand resulting from the payoff of several mortgage loans and debt securities  as well as the funds received from the sale of our investment in arcap and debt securities in fees related to prepayment of assets in represent the recognition of fees relating to an early payoff of a gnma certificate and a mezzanine loan during that year  which were significantly larger than fees received for investments prepaid in there were no such fees recognized in as the prepayment fee on a comparable transaction was deferred and will be recognized over the life of a refinanced loan we originated

there were no such securities outstanding during general and administrative expenses increased for both and  primarily due to increased legal fees  trustee fees and insurance 
the period also includes higher share based compensation costs due to the accelerated vesting of certain options in the first half of and a  legal settlement 
these increases were partially offset by decreased investor services expenses  as compared to due to costs in related to changes in our trust agreement for which we needed shareholder approval and a decrease in excise taxes because distributions were in excess of taxable earnings for the year

funds from operations funds from operations ffo  represents net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  excluding depreciation and amortization related to real property and including funds from operations for unconsolidated joint ventures calculated on the same basis 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our management considers ffo a supplemental measure of operating performance  and  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities  and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures  and to fund other cash needs

liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we expect that cash generated from our investments  as well as our borrowing capacity  will meet our needs for short term liquidity and will be sufficient to pay all expenses and distributions to our shareholders in amounts sufficient to retain our reit status in the foreseeable future 
in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  as amended  we must  among other things  distribute at least of our taxable income 
we believe that we are in compliance with the reit related provisions of the code 
as of december   our credit facilities consisted of o a mortgage loan repurchase facility  o debt securities repurchase facilities  and o a line of credit with chartermac 
mortgage loan repurchase facility during  we began financing our investment growth by utilizing cdo securitizations 
prior to a securitization  we finance investments through a mortgage loan repurchase facility  which is repaid from the proceeds received when the cdo securitization is complete 
during december  we executed a repurchase agreement with citigroup global markets  inc citigroup for the purpose of funding investment activity for loans that are to be placed into a second cdo securitization 
advance rates on the borrowings from this facility  ranging from to of collateral value  are determined on a loan by loan basis 
interest on the borrowings  which ranges from libor plus to libor plus  is also determined on a loan by loan basis 
the repurchase facility expires upon inception of the cdo securitization  or twelve months after the inception of the repurchase facility  whichever comes first 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under this facility  at a weighted average interest rate of

we have capacity to raise approximately million of additional funds by issuing either common or preferred shares pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
if market conditions warrant  we may seek to raise additional funds for investment through further offerings  although the timing and amount of such offerings cannot be determined at this time 
summary of cash flows during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million 
operating cash flows decreased by million primarily due to lower cash earnings  offset by an increase in distributions received from arcap and the favorable variance in timing of liabilities payable 
an increase in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and a corresponding increase in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to a higher level of investing activity in mortgage loans  subordinated b notes and bridge loans during the period 
the higher level of investing in corresponded to the increase in net borrowings 
during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million 
operating cash flows improved by approximately million primarily due to higher earnings 
an increase in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and an increase in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to an increase in proceeds received from repurchase and warehouse facilities used for purchases of mortgage loans and debt securities

application of critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events which cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statement o assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes  o classification and valuation of mezzanine loan investments  and o classification and valuation of real estate owned 
assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  establishes standards regarding impairment issues related to our mortgage loans and notes receivable 
our portfolio of mortgage loans and notes is periodically evaluated for impairment to establish appropriate loan loss reserves  if necessary 
our advisor has a credit review committee which meets monthly and reviews the status of each loan and note and maintains a watch list of loans including loans for which we have issued guarantees for which the underlying property may be experiencing construction cost overruns  delays in construction completion  occupancy shortfalls  lower than expected debt service coverage ratios  or other matters which might cause the borrower to be unable to make scheduled interest and principal payments 
if a loan is experiencing difficulties  members of this credit committee work with the borrower to try to resolve the issues  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of our advisor  it is determined that it is probable that we will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan or note would be deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
classification and valuation of mezzanine loan investments our mezzanine loan investments bear interest at fixed or variable rates  and some also include provisions that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  our management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate  using the guidance contained in the third notice to practitioners issued by the aicpa 
although the accounting methodology does not affect our cash flows from these investments  this determination affects the balance sheet classification of the investments as well as the classification  timing and amounts of reported earnings 
accounting for the investment as real estate is required if we expect that the amount of profit  regardless of its nature  is over percent of the property s total expected residual profit 
if a mezzanine investment were accounted for as an investment in real estate  our consolidated balance sheets would show the underlying property and its related senior debt if such debt were not also held by us  and our consolidated statements of income would include the property s rental revenues  operating expenses and depreciation 
if we expect to receive less than percent of the property s residual profit  then loan or joint venture accounting is applied 
loan accounting is appropriate o if the borrower has a substantial equity investment in the property  o if we have recourse to substantial assets of the borrower  o if the property is generating sufficient cash flow to service normal loan amortization  or o if certain other conditions are met 
under loan accounting  we recognize interest income as earned and additional interest from participations as received 
joint venture accounting would require that we only record our share of the net income from the underlying property 
our management must exercise judgment in making the required accounting determinations 
for each mezzanine arrangement  we project total cash flows over the loan s term and our share in those cash flows  and consider the borrower s equity  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to us over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making an assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  we have determined that all mezzanine investments should be accounted for as loans 
classification and valuation of real estate owned the accounting for the foreclosure  ownership and subsequent sale of real estate is governed by o sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  o sfas no 
 accounting for the sale or disposal of long lived assets  and o sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
during  we exercised our rights under subordinated promissory notes and other documents to take possession of certain real estate collateral 
we have also purchased the first mortgage loans on all of the respective properties  and acquired the real estate at foreclosure auctions 
all of the properties were subsequently sold  although the sale transaction for three of the properties did not meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 despite the fact that the purchaser later secured permanent first mortgage financing 
when a loan is in the process of foreclosure  it is our policy to initially reclassify the balance of the loan into real estate owned held for sale at the lower of fair value of the real estate  less estimated disposal costs or the carrying amount of the loan  and to cease accrual of interest 
we obtain independent appraisals of all foreclosed real estate to assist management in evaluating property values 
to date  no losses have been recorded upon foreclosure 
it is our intent to sell foreclosed properties within a short time period 
due to the held for sale classification  we do not initially depreciate the properties 
if we do not sell a property or do not meet sale criteria within the permissible timeframe for held for sale classification  we reclassify the property into real estate owned held and used or subject to sales contract categories and account for it as an operating asset 
depreciation is recorded for the asset including a retroactive adjustment for the full period that the property was classified as real estate owned held for sale 
income from property operations is recorded provided realization and collectibility of the amounts are considered likely 
likewise  interest income on notes receivable for properties sold that do not meet the criteria for sale recognition is recorded to the extent that collectibility is considered likely 
this accounting for real estate owned requires substantial judgment as to the fair value of the assets  the likelihood of collecting income and our ability to sell the properties 
as of december   we believe that the amounts reported are fairly stated and realizable 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements we have no unconsolidated subsidiaries  special purpose off balance sheet financing entities  or other off balance sheet arrangements

the sec staff believes that a registrant should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab was effective for and its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement was issued with the intent to provide an alternative measurement treatment for certain financial assets and liabilities 
the alternative measurement would permit fair value to be used for both initial and subsequent measurement  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
this fair value option would be available on a contract by contract basis 
the effective date for this statement is the beginning of our fiscal year 
the company is currently assessing the impact adoption may have on its financial statements 
there are no other new pending accounting pronouncements which we are required to adopt that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect our income in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets net of credit losses and our borrowing costs 
although we have originated variable rate loans  most of our assets generate fixed returns and have terms in excess of five years 
we fund the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have variable interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as weekly  monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence our net income 
our borrowings under repurchase facilities and our trust preferred securities bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow our management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings 
we enter into certain hedging transactions to protect our positions from interest rate fluctuations and other charges in market conditions 
these transactions include interest rate swaps and fair value hedges 
based on the million unhedged portion of million of borrowings outstanding at december   a change in libor would impact our annual net income and cash flows by approximately  however  as the interest income from some of our loans is also based on libor  a change in libor would impact our annual net income and cash flows from such loans by approximately  the net effect of a change in libor would therefore result in a change of our annual net income by approximately  in addition  a change in libor could also impede the collections of interest on our variable rate loans  as there might not be sufficient cash flow at the properties to pay the increased debt service 
because the value of our debt securities fluctuates with changes in interest rates  rate fluctuations will also affect the market value of our net assets 
management s report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting the management of american mortgage acceptance company and its subsidiaries the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of trustees regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations

our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by  or under the supervision of  the company s principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  and effected by the company s board of directors  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
