table of contents business strategy of portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business historically  firstcity has leveraged its expertise in asset resolution and servicing by investing in a wide variety of asset types across a broad geographic scope 
firstcity continues to follow this investment strategy and seeks expansion opportunities into new asset classes and geographic areas when it believes it can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns 
the following items are significant elements of firstcity s business strategy in the portfolio acquisition and resolution business traditional markets 
firstcity believes it will continue to invest in portfolio assets acquired from financial institutions and government agencies  both for its own account or through investment entities formed with cargill or one or more other co investors 
niche markets 
firstcity believes it will continue to pursue profitable private market niches in which to invest 
the niche investment opportunities that firstcity has pursued to date include i the acquisition of improved or unimproved real estate  including excess retail sites  and ii periodic purchases of single financial or real estate assets from banks and other financial institutions with which firstcity has established relationships  and from a variety of other sellers that are familiar with the company s reputation for acting quickly and efficiently 
foreign markets 
firstcity believes that the foreign markets for portfolio assets are less developed than the us market  and therefore provide a greater opportunity to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns 
firstcity has purchased portfolio assets in france  germany  japan sold in  mexico  the virgin islands  dominican republic  puerto rico  chile and argentina and expects to continue to seek purchase opportunities outside of the united states 
sba lending 
in november  the company  through its subsidiary american business lending  inc abl acquired a license from the us small business administration the sba to originate and service sba a loans 
the company believes that the ability to originate these types of loans provides the diversity to create an attractive growth opportunity within the domestic market 
consumer lending discontinued operations on september   firstcity and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement to sell the remaining beneficial ownership interest in drive and its general partner  drive gp llc  to ifa gp  ifa lp and mg lp for a total purchase price of million in cash  resulting in distributions and payments to firstcity in the aggregate amount of million in cash  from various sources 
the sale was completed on november   and the net cash proceeds from these transactions were primarily used to pay off debt 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations  assets and liabilities of the consumer business segment as discontinued operations 
the assets and liabilities of such operations have been classified as discontinued consumer assets held for sale and liabilities from discontinued consumer operations 
government regulation certain aspects of the company s portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business are subject to regulation under various foreign  federal  state and local statutes and regulations that impose requirements and restrictions affecting  among other things  disclosures to obligors  the terms of secured transactions  collection  repossession and claims handling procedures  multiple qualification and licensing requirements for doing business in various jurisdictions  and other trade practices 

table of contents competition the portfolio asset acquisition business is highly competitive 
some of the company s principal competitors are substantially larger and better capitalized than the company 
because of these resources  these companies may be better able than the company to acquire portfolio assets  to pursue new business opportunities or to survive periods of industry consolidation 
generally  there are three aspects of the distressed asset business due diligence  portfolio management  and servicing 
the company is a major participant in all three areas 
in comparison  certain of its competitors including certain securities and banking firms have historically competed primarily as portfolio purchasers and have customarily engaged other parties to conduct due diligence on potential portfolio purchases and to service acquired assets  and certain other competitors including certain banking and other firms have historically competed primarily as servicing companies 
the company believes that its ability to acquire portfolios for its own account and through acquisition partnerships will be an important component of the company s overall future growth 
acquisitions of portfolios are often based on competitive bidding  which involves the danger of bidding too low which generates no business  or bidding too high which could result in the purchase of a portfolio at an economically unattractive price 
employees the company had employees as of december  no employee is a member of a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes that its relations with its employees are good 
foreign operations we have investments in various acquisition partnerships and servicing entities in europe and central and south america 
revenues outside of the us are a material part of our business  and they accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in each year in the three year period ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in maintaining foreign operations  our business is exposed to risks inherent in such operations  including those of currency fluctuations

item a 
risk factors 
this section highlights specific risks that could affect our company and its businesses 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
based on the information currently known to us  we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company 
however  the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur  these events or circumstances could have a material 
table of contents adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
we may not predict the availability of portfolio assets 
long term cycles in the general economy affect the business of acquiring and resolving portfolio assets 
we cannot predict our future annual acquisition volume of portfolio assets 
moreover  our future purchase of portfolio assets will depend on the availability of portfolios offered for sale  the availability of capital and our ability to submit successful bids to purchase portfolio assets 
due to the highly competitive environment of the business of acquiring portfolio assets in the united states  we may be required to acquire portfolio assets at higher prices lowering our profit margins on the resolution of such portfolios 
to offset these changes in the domestic arena  we continue to develop our presence in other markets 
under certain circumstances  we may choose not to bid for portfolio assets that we believe cannot be acquired at attractive prices 
as a result of all the above factors  we may be materially adversely affected by variations on our portfolio asset purchases  and the revenue derived from the resolution of such portfolio assets 
our ability to manage risks associated with growth and entry into new businesses and foreign markets may be limited 
we have entered into new business related to the portfolio asset acquisition business and new foreign markets in the portfolio asset acquisition business 
we have also recently entered into the business of originating and servicing loans as a small business lending company through our ninety six percent investment in american business lending  inc abl and acquisition by abl of unguaranteed portions of certain business loans  certain loan servicing rights and obligations including certain fees to be earned on the portion of such loans that are guaranteed by the us small business administration 
additionally  we have entered into a special situations platform that will buy or finance distressed debt and companies  originate junior and senior bridge loans  and execute lower middle market buyouts through our eighty percent investment in firstcity crestone 
we are also expanding operations in latin america and europe 
the entry into these new businesses and foreign markets has resulted in increased demands on our personnel and systems 
the development and integration of the new businesses and operations in foreign venues requires the investment of additional capital and the continuous involvement of our senior management 
we also must manage a variety of businesses and operations in foreign venues with differing markets  customer bases  financial products  systems and managements 
an inability to develop  integrate and manage our businesses and operations in foreign venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
risks related to the start up of a business or entry into a new foreign market  including the ability to implement the new business plan and strategy to generate sufficient revenues necessary to avoid losses common to start up companies  the availability of opportunities for investment in the markets to be entered  the dependency of new businesses for liquidity and our ability to support and manage continued growth is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to attract and retain senior management for each of our businesses  to hire  train  and manage our workforce and to continue to develop the skills necessary for us to compete successfully in our existing and new businesses and operations in foreign venues 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully meet all of these challenges 
it is likely that our actual experience will not be consistent with the assumptions underlying our portfolio asset performance and that the differences may be material and adverse 
we determine the purchase price and carrying value of portfolio assets acquired by us by estimating expected future cash flows from such assets 
we develop and revise such estimates based on our historical experience and current market conditions  and based on the discount rates that we 
table of contents believe are appropriate for the assets comprising the portfolios 
in addition  many obligors on portfolio assets have impaired or poor credit history  low income or other adverse credit events 
we are subject to various risks associated with these borrowers  including  but not limited to  the risk that the borrowers will not satisfy their debt service obligations and that the realizable value of the assets securing their loans will not be sufficient to repay the borrowers debt 
if our portfolio asset performance differs from our assumptions and estimates  we may be materially adversely affected 
investments in and revenues from our foreign operations are subject to the risks associated with transactions involving foreign currencies 
we have acquired  and manage and resolve  portfolio assets located in europe and latin america and are actively pursuing opportunities to purchase additional pools of distressed assets in these locations 
foreign operations are subject to various special risks  including currency translation risks  currency exchange rate fluctuations  exchange controls and different political  social and legal environments within such foreign markets 
to the extent future financing in foreign currencies is unavailable at reasonable rates  we will be further exposed to currency translation risks  currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls 
in addition  earnings of foreign operations may be subject to foreign income taxes that reduce cash flow available to meet debt service requirements and our other obligations  which may be payable even if we have no earnings on a consolidated basis 
fluctuation in our reported results from operations in foreign countries could materially adversely affect us 
we may be materially adversely affected by fluctuation in interest rates 
most of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest 
we will be materially impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
in addition  a substantial and sustained decline in interest rates may adversely impact the amount of distressed assets available for purchase by us 
the value of our interest earning assets and liabilities may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates  including the valuation of any residual interests in securitizations that would be severely impacted by increased loan prepayments resulting from declining interest rates 
our liquidity or ability to raise capital may be limited 
the successful execution of our business strategy depends on our continued access to financing 
in addition  we must also have access to liquidity to invest as equity or subordinated debt to meet our capital needs 
we rely upon access to the capital markets and the cash flow from our subsidiaries to fund asset growth and to provide sources of liquidity 
our ability to issue and sell common equity including securities convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  common equity is limited as a result of the tax laws relating to the preservation of the nols available to us as a result of the merger 
there can be no assurance that our funding relationships with commercial banks  investment banks and financial services companies including the bank of scotland will continue past their respective current maturity dates 
if these credit facilities are not extended and we cannot find alternative funding sources on satisfactory terms  or at all  we may be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we may be materially adversely affected by the decline in value of collateral securing loans acquired for resolution 
the value of the collateral securing loans acquired for resolution  as well as real estate or other acquired distressed assets  is subject to various risks  including uninsured damage  change in location or 
table of contents decline in value caused by use  age or market conditions 
we may be materially adversely affected by any material decline in the value of such collateral 
we may not have access to the estimated net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that  as a result of the merger  approximately million of nols were available to us to offset future taxable income as of december  since december   we have generated an additional million in tax operating losses  utilized million of nols  written off million of nols  and had expiring nols of million in and million in accordingly  as of december   we believe that we have approximately million of nols available to offset future taxable income 
out of the total million of nols  we estimate that we will be able to utilize million  which equates to a million deferred tax asset on our books and records 
however  because our position in respect of the million nols resulting from the merger is based upon factual determinations and upon legal issues with respect to which there is uncertainty and because no ruling has been obtained from the internal revenue service the irs regarding the availability of the nols to us  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the availability of such nols and  if challenged  that the irs will not be successful in disallowing this portion of our nols  with the result that our million deferred tax asset would be reduced or eliminated 
some of the nols may be carried forward to offset our future federal taxable income through the year  however  the availability of some of the nols began to expire beginning in our ability to utilize such nols will be severely limited if there is a more than ownership change at our company during a three year testing period within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code 
if we were unable to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income  we would lose our ability to generate capital to support our expansion plans on a tax advantaged basis  to offset our pretax income and our consolidated subsidiaries pretax income  and to have access to the cash flow that would otherwise be represented by payments of federal tax liabilities 
it is possible that our actual experience will not be consistent with the assumptions regarding recognition of deferred tax asset and that the differences may be material and adverse 
as noted above  we have nols available for federal income tax purposes to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the year a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to a level  which  more likely than not  will be realized 
realization is determined based on our management s expectation of generating sufficient taxable income in a look forward period over the next four years 
the ultimate realization of the resulting net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax asset  net of the allowance  will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change 
the change in valuation allowance represents a change in the estimate of the future taxable income during the carryforward period since the prior year end and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards since the merger 
our ability to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly 
see discussion of critical accounting policies deferred tax asset 
we may incur significant costs relating to removal of hazardous substances or waste from real property in its portfolio assets 
we acquire through our subsidiaries and affiliates real property in our portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business 
there is a risk that properties acquired by us could contain hazardous 
table of contents substances or waste  contaminants or pollutants 
we may be required to remove such substances from the affected properties at our expense  and the cost of such removal may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by such properties 
furthermore  we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties to recover our costs  either as a matter of law or regulation  or as a result of such prior owners financial inability to pay such costs 
we may find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties either prior to or following any such removal 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the business in which we operate 
the business in which we operate is highly competitive 
some of our principal competitors are substantially larger and better capitalized than us 
because of their resources  these companies may be better able than us to acquire portfolio assets  to pursue new business opportunities or to survive periods of industry consolidation 
access to and the cost of capital are critical to our ability to compete 
many of our competitors have superior access to capital sources and can arrange or obtain lower cost of capital  resulting in a competitive disadvantage to us with respect to such competitors 
in addition  certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments  which could allow these competitors to establish lower margin requirements and pricing levels than those established by us 
in the event a significant number of competitors establish pricing levels below those established by us  our ability to compete would be materially adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by a general deterioration in economic conditions 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  or declining demand for commercial real estate or commercial or consumer loans may adversely affect our business 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  whether general  regional or industry related  may adversely affect the resolution of portfolio assets  lead to a decline in prices or demand for collateral underlying portfolio assets  or increase the cost of capital invested by us and the length of time that capital is invested in a particular portfolio 
all or any one of these events could decrease the rate of return and profits to be realized from such portfolio and materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
we may be adversely affected by the regulated environment in which we operate 
some aspects of our business are subject to regulation  examination and licensing under various federal  state and local statutes and regulations that impose requirements and restrictions affecting  among other things  credit activities  maximum interest rates  finance and other charges  disclosures to obligors  the terms of secured transactions  collection  repossession and claims handling procedures  multiple qualification and licensing requirements for doing business in various jurisdictions  and other trade practices 
we believe to be currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such compliance 
failure to comply with  or changes in  these laws or regulations  or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business  could have an adverse effect on our company by  among other things  limiting the income we may generate on existing and additional loans  limiting the states in which we may operate or restricting our ability to realize on the collateral securing its loans 
see item business government regulation 
we may be adversely affected by the result of certain legal proceedings 
periodically  our company  our subsidiaries  our affiliates and the acquisition partnerships are parties to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by a termination of our relationship with cargill 
our relationship with cargill is material in a number of respects 
cargill  a subsidiary of cargill  incorporated  a privately held  multi national agricultural and financial services company  has provided equity and debt financings for some of the acquisition partnerships 
cargill beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  and a cargill designee  jeffery leu  is a member of our board of directors 
we believe that our relationship with cargill significantly enhances our credibility as a purchaser of portfolio assets and facilitates its ability to expand into other businesses and foreign markets 
although our management believes that our relationship with cargill is excellent  there can be no assurance that such relationship will continue in the future 
as we have begun to acquire more portfolios on our own or with other partners and have secured alternative sources of financing  our dependence on cargill has diminished 
there can be no assurance that such alternative financing will continue to be available 
any termination of such relationship could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
we may be adversely affected by a termination of employment of certain key personnel 
we are dependent on the efforts of our senior executive officers  particularly james t 
sartain president and chief executive officer 
we are also dependent on several of the key members of our management who are instrumental in developing and implementing the business strategy for the company 
in addition  our borrowing facilities include key personnel provisions 
these provisions generally provide that if certain key personnel are no longer employed and suitable replacements are not found within a defined time limit  certain facilities become due and payable 
we may be adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of one or more of these individuals to continue in his present role 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing individuals will continue to serve in his current capacity or for what time period such service might continue 
we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of its senior executive officers 
our directors and executive officers may effectively control any vote of stockholders of our company 
our directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own of the common stock 
although there are no agreements or arrangements with respect to voting such common stock among such persons  they  if acting together  may effectively be able to control any vote of our stockholders and thereby exert considerable influence over the affairs of our company 
james t 
sartain  president and chief executive officer of our company  is the beneficial owner of of the common stock 
there can be no assurance that the interests of management or the other entities and individuals will be aligned with our other stockholders 
restrictions on transfer of shares may prevent certain holders of our common stock from transferring such stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the certificate of incorporation contains provisions restricting the transfer of its securities that are designed to delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company by deterring unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals and compelling negotiations with our board of directors rather than non negotiated takeover attempts even if such events may be in the best interests of our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also contains certain provisions restricting the transfer of securities in our company that are designed to prevent ownership changes that might limit or eliminate our ability to use our nols resulting from the merger 
such restrictions may prevent certain holders of common stock from transferring such stock even if such holders are permitted to sell such stock without restriction under the securities act of  as amended  and may limit our ability to sell common stock to certain 
table of contents existing holders of common stock at an advantageous time or at a time when capital may be required but unavailable from any other source 
we may be adversely affected by period to period variances 
the revenue of our company and acquisition partnerships is based on proceeds realized from the resolution of the portfolio assets  which proceeds have historically varied significantly and likely will continue to vary significantly from period to period 
consequently  our period to period revenue and results of operations have historically varied  and are likely to continue to vary  correspondingly 
such variances  alone or with other factors  such as conditions in the economy or the financial services industries or other developments affecting us  may result in significant fluctuations in our reported operations and in the trading prices of our securities  particularly the common stock 
we may be adversely affected by tax  monetary and fiscal policy changes 
we originate and acquire financial assets  the value and income potential of which are subject to influence by foreign regulations  various state and federal tax  monetary and fiscal policies in effect from time to time 
the nature and direction of such policies are entirely outside our control  and we cannot predict the timing or effect of changes in such policies 
changes in such policies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
we may be adversely affected by changes in future cash receipts 
we have in the past been able to establish with reasonable accuracy the estimated future cash receipts over the life of a purchased asset pool 
changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  deterioration of collateral values  and other factors described in this section could cause the estimates of future cash flows to be materially different than actual cash receipts 
the effects of an increase in the estimated future cash receipts would generally increase revenues from portfolio assets by increasing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and increasing the effective yield on a performing or sop portfolio while a decrease in future cash receipts would generally have the effect of reducing revenues by reducing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and decreasing the effective yield on a performing or sop portfolio 
in some cases a reduction in the total future cash receipts by collecting those cash receipts sooner than expected could have a positive impact on our revenues from portfolio assets due to reduced interest expense and other carrying costs associated with the portfolio assets 
although such trend is a generally positive trend  we may be adversely affected by the higher levels of interest expense and other carrying costs of the portfolios negating any potentially positive effects

results of independent investigation the audit committee of the board of directors conducted an independent investigation to review whether firstcity and its subsidiaries received inadequate compensation  or other improprieties occurred  with respect to the sale of a loan portfolio to a third party  and firstcity s compliance with laws applicable to its foreign operations as a result of allegations against an officer of an affiliate of firstcity regarding matters that occurred prior to the individual s becoming an officer of that affiliate 
the audit committee engaged an outside law firm to act as independent counsel and conduct the investigation 
independent counsel worked with external forensic accountants to conduct its review 
the independent investigation found that the loan portfolio sale was initiated by other portfolio investors  who owned a majority investment in the portfolio  and that the portfolio appeared to have been sold for the best price available at the time 
the independent investigation found no evidence indicating that firstcity or any officer  manager or full time employee personally benefited from the transactions relating to the portfolio sale 
the independent investigation concluded that the sales price received by firstcity and the other portfolio investors was reasonable based upon the information that was available at the time of the sale 
the independent investigation concluded that it was unable to complete its review of the issues relating to allegations against the officer of an affiliate of firstcity due to its inability to access certain documentation outside firstcity s custody and control 
firstcity has reviewed these issues  performed on site procedures at the affiliate location and has determined that no adjustment to firstcity s financial statements is required in connection with this issue 
the independent investigation recommended improvements designed to provide additional assurances for accurate financial reporting  particularly with respect to firstcity s latin american operations  and to improve firstcity s internal control structure 
the independent investigation also recommended changes in firstcity s approach to foreign business relationships

revenue recognition portfolio assets on january   firstcity adopted the provisions of sop as defined under effect of new accounting standards 
for loan portfolios acquired prior to january   firstcity 
table of contents designated these loans as non performing portfolio assets or performing portfolio assets 
such designation was made at the acquisition of the pool and does not change even though the actual performance of the loans may change 
firstcity accounts for all nonperforming loans acquired after in accordance with sop following is a description of each classification and the related accounting policy accorded to each portfolio type 
loans acquired prior to non performing portfolio assets non performing portfolio assets consist primarily of distressed loans and loan related assets  such as foreclosed upon collateral 
accounting for non performing portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
prior to january   portfolio assets were designated as non performing if a majority of all of the loans in the portfolio were significantly under performing in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements at the date of acquisition 
net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets is recognized as income to the extent that proceeds collected exceed a pro rata portion of allocated cost from the pool 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual proceeds divided by total estimated proceeds of the pool 
no interest income is recognized separately on non performing portfolio assets 
all proceeds  of whatever type  are included in proceeds from resolution of portfolio assets in determining the gain on resolution of such assets 
all non performing portfolio assets are purchased at discounts from their outstanding legal principal amount  the total of the aggregate of expected future sales prices and the total payments to be received from obligors 
subsequent to acquisition  the adjusted cost of non performing portfolio assets is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  which represents the net realizable value of the non performing pool 
once it is determined that there is impairment  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded no allowance for impairment in and and  in the actual future proceeds of the pool could vary materially from the estimated proceeds of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  deterioration of collateral values  deterioration in the borrower s financial condition and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future proceeds of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets 
in the event that actual future proceeds of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in lower net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool 
performing portfolio assets performing portfolio assets consist primarily of portfolios of loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate amount of the borrowers obligation 
prior to january   performing portfolio assets were accounted for using the interest method acquisition discounts for the portfolio as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the portfolio 
performing portfolio assets are carried at the unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans  net of acquisition discounts and allowance for loan losses 
significant increases in expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the internal rate of return irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
income on performing portfolio assets is accrued monthly based on each loan pool s effective irr 

table of contents cash flows greater than the interest accrual will reduce the carrying value of the pool 
likewise  cash flows that are less than the accrual will increase the carrying balance 
the irr is estimated and periodically recalculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection model 
gains are recognized on the performing portfolio assets when sufficient funds are received to fully satisfy the obligation on loans included in the pool  either from funds from the borrower or sale of the loan 
the gain recognized represents the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the individual loan in the pool 
the actual future cash flows of the pool could vary materially from the expected future cash flows of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  changes in collateral values  deterioration in the borrowers financial condition  restructure or renewal of individual loans in the pool  sale of loans within the pool and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future cash flows of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher level of interest income due to greater amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from the performing portfolio assets as well as higher gains recognized on the sale of individual loans from a pool 
in the event that actual future cash flows of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in a lower level of interest income and reduced gains from the sale of assets from a pool  lower levels of interest income as a result of lower amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool due to a decline in the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of loans acquired prior to management s best estimate of irr as of january   is the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
if it is probable that all cash flows estimated at acquisition plus any changes to expected cash flows arising from changes in estimates after acquisition would not be collected  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
prior to january   impairment charges would be taken to the income statement with a corresponding write off of the receivable balance 
consequently  no allowance for loan loss was recorded prior to january  the company recorded provisions for impairment of loans in the amounts of  in   in and  in a pool can become fully amortized zero carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as revenue when received 
additionally  the company uses the cost recovery method when timing and amount of collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the portfolio  or until such time that the company considers the collections to be probable and estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
loans acquired after loans acquired with credit deterioration at acquisition  firstcity reviews each loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that firstcity will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  firstcity determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics including loan type  collateral type  geographical location  performance status and borrower relationship 

table of contents firstcity considers expected prepayments  and estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows expected at acquisition for each loan and each subsequently aggregated pool of loans 
firstcity determines the excess of the loan s or pool s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over all cash flows expected at acquisition as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the loan s cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment in the loan or pool is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool accretable yield 
over the life of the loan or pool  firstcity continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
firstcity evaluates at the balance sheet date whether the present value of its loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased below book value and if so  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the present value of any subsequent increase in the loan s or pool s actual cash flows or cash flows expected to be collected is used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increases in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected will be used to recalculate the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for all acquired loans subject to sop to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition that are not expected to be collected 
the company established a valuation allowance of  in and none in on these loans 
loans acquired with no credit deterioration loans acquired without evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition for which firstcity has the positive intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and reported at their unpaid principal balance net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums 
interest accrual ceases when payments become days contractually past due 
an allowance for loan losses is established when a loan becomes impaired 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the company established a valuation allowance of  in and  in on these loans 
real estate portfolios real estate portfolios consist of real estate acquired from a variety of sellers 
such portfolios are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
costs relating to the development and improvement of real estate for its intended use are capitalized  whereas those relating to holding assets are charged to expense 
income or loss is recognized upon the disposal of the real estate 
rental income  net of expenses  on real estate portfolios is recognized when received 
accounting for the portfolios is on an individual asset by asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
subsequent to acquisition  the amortized cost of real estate portfolios is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  net of costs to sell  which represents the net realizable value of the real estate portfolio 
impairment losses are charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded impairment losses of   and  as of december   and  respectively 

table of contents deferred tax asset as a part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves calculating the company s current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or changes in tax rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets  if any  is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
as a result of the merger  the company has substantial federal nols that can be used to offset the tax liability associated with the company s pre tax earnings until the earlier of the expiration or utilization of such nols 
the company accounts for the benefit of the nols by recording the benefit as an asset and then establishing an allowance to value the net deferred tax asset at a value commensurate with the company s expectation of being able to utilize the recognized benefit in the foreseeable future 
such estimates are reevaluated on a quarterly basis with the adjustment to the allowance recorded as an adjustment to the income tax expense generated by the quarterly operating results 
significant events that change the company s view of its currently estimated ability to utilize the tax benefits result in substantial changes to the estimated allowance required to value the deferred tax benefits recognized in the company s periodic consolidated financial statements 
the company s analysis resulted in no change in  and the company has a net deferred tax asset of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which is composed of a gross deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  firstcity sold its remaining interest in drive in november the ultimate realization of the resulting net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income from its continuing operations prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that the deferred tax asset  net of allowance  has been carried at low levels  and thus  the sale of drive has no impact on firstcity s ability to realize all of the deferred tax asset  net of allowance 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change 
the ability of the company to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly

risk factors 
equity investments in acquisition partnerships firstcity accounts for its investments in acquisition partnerships and their general partners using the equity method of accounting 
this accounting method generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings from the partnerships activities as if it had a direct investment in the underlying portfolio assets held by the partnerships 
the revenues and earnings of the partnerships are determined on a basis consistent with the accounting methodology applied to portfolio assets as described in the preceding paragraphs 
firstcity has ownership interests in the various partnerships that range from to 
the company also holds investments in servicing entities that are accounted for under the equity method 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 

table of contents generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are comprised of two components previously reported as the company s residential and commercial mortgage banking business and the consumer lending business conducted through firstcity s minority interest investment in drive 
in november  firstcity completed the sale of its interest in drive  and as of december   the company had zero assets remaining from the discontinued consumer operations  but certain income realized from such operations 
the only asset remaining from discontinued mortgage operations is an investment security resulting from the retention of a residual interest in a securitization transaction 
this security is in run off  and the company is contractually obligated to service this asset 
prior to the fourth quarter of  firstcity classified these securities as held to maturity and considered the estimated future gross cash receipts for such investment securities in the computation of the value of such investment securities 
in the fourth quarter of  firstcity s management elected to pursue a strategy to liquidate these assets and carry them as held for sale 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the remaining security is recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the cash flows are collected over a period of time and are valued using a discount rate of and prepayment assumptions of for fixed rate loans and for variable rate loans 
overall loss rates are estimated at of collateral 
the assumptions used in the valuation model consider both industry as well as the company s historical experience and are reviewed quarterly in light of historical evidence in revising the prospective results of the model 
these revised assumptions could potentially result in either an increase or decrease in the estimated cash receipts 
an additional provision is booked based on the output of the valuation model if deemed necessary 
the company recorded provisions of  in   in and million in for additional losses from discontinued mortgage operations 
in  the provision primarily relates to firstcity adjusting the carrying value of the residual interests to fair value 
the additional provision in primarily related to a decrease in the estimated future gross cash receipts on residual interests in securitizations as a result of the actual losses exceeding the losses projected by the valuation model 
estimates of future cash receipts the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from acquired portfolio asset pools are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of sales of non performing portfolios  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in a pool of portfolio assets 
calculation of the estimates of future cash receipts the company uses a proprietary asset management software program to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects 
table of contents future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset and the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
risks associated with these estimates the company has in the past been able to establish with reasonable accuracy the estimated future cash receipts over the life of a purchased asset pool 
changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  deterioration of collateral values  and other factors described in the risk factors section could cause the estimates of future cash flows to be materially different than actual cash receipts 
the effects of an increase in the estimated future cash receipts would generally increase revenues from portfolio assets by increasing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and increasing the effective yield on a performing or sop portfolio while a decrease in future cash receipts would generally have the effect of reducing revenues by reducing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and creating impairment on a performing or sop portfolio 
in some cases a reduction in the total future cash receipts by collecting those cash receipts sooner than expected could have a positive impact on the company s revenues from portfolio assets due to reduced interest expense and other carrying costs associated with the portfolio assets 
likewise an increase in future cash receipts  although generally a positive trend  could have a negative impact on future revenues of the company if collected over a longer period  resulting in higher levels of interest expense and other carrying costs of the portfolios negating any potentially positive effects 
consolidation policy in addition to consolidating entities in which firstcity has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest  firstcity evaluates the consolidation of entities to which common conditions of consolidation  such as voting interests and board representation  do not apply 
firstcity performs this evaluation pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r provides that  in the absence of clear control through voting interests  board representation or similar rights  a company s exposure  or variable interest  to the economic risks and potential rewards associated with its interest in the entity is the best evidence of control 
in connection with fin r  when evaluating an entity for consolidation  firstcity first determines whether an entity is within the scope of fin r and if it is deemed to be a variable interest entity vie 
if the entity is considered to be a vie  firstcity determines whether it would be considered the entity s primary beneficiary 
firstcity consolidates those vies for which it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary 
generally  firstcity will consolidate an entity not deemed either a vie upon a determination that its ownership  direct or indirect  exceeds fifty percent of the outstanding voting shares of an entity and or that it has the ability to control the financial or operating policies through its voting rights  board representation or other similar rights 
for entities where firstcity does not have a controlling interest financial or operating  the investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity 
firstcity applies the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee in accordance with apb opinion no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s operations are materially impacted by net gains on sales of loans and net interest margins 
the level of gains from loan sales the company achieves is dependent on demand for the products originated 
net interest margins are dependent on the company s ability to maintain the spread or interest differential between the interest it charges the customer for loans and the interest the company is charged for the financing of those loans 
the following describes each component of interest bearing assets held by the company and how each could be affected by changes in interest rates 
the company invests in portfolio assets both directly through consolidated subsidiaries and indirectly through equity investments in acquisition partnerships 
portfolio assets consist of investments in pools of non homogenous assets that predominantly consist of loan and real estate assets 
earnings from these assets are based on the estimated future cash flows from such assets and recorded when those cash flows occur 
the underlying loans within these pools bear both fixed and variable rates 
due to the non performing nature and history of these loans  changes in prevailing benchmark rates such as the prime rate or libor generally have a nominal effect on the ultimate future cash flow to be realized from the portfolio assets 
loans receivable consist of investment loans made to acquisition partnerships and other unrelated entities  and bear interest at predominately fixed rates 
the collectibility of these loans is directly related to the underlying portfolio assets of those acquisition partnerships  which are non performing in nature 
therefore  changes in benchmark rates would have minimal effect on the collectibility of these loans 
firstcity had million in debt outstanding at december  the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its variable rate debt  which totaled million or of the company s total debt 
a basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease firstcity s annual interest expense by approximately 
million annually 
foreign currency risk the company currently has loans and equity investments in europe  latin america ie mexico  argentina  dominican republic and chile and canada 
in europe and in mexico  the company s investments are primarily in the form of equity and represent a significant portion of the company s total equity investments 
as previously discussed  the revolving acquisition facility with bank of scotland for million allows loans to be made in euros up to a maximum amount in euros that is equivalent to million us dollars 
at december   the company had million in euro denominated debt for the purpose of hedging a portion of the net equity investments in europe 
in november the company acquired a line of credit facility with banco santander  sa that allows loans to be made in mexican pesos up to a maximum that is equivalent to million us dollars 
at december   the company had million in mexican peso denominated debt 
management of the company feels that these loan agreements will help reduce the risk of adverse effects of currency changes on these investments 

table of contents a sharp change in the foreign currencies related to the investments in europe  latin america and canada relative to the us dollar could materially adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
a and incremental depreciation of these currencies would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s foreign investments and are indicated in the following table 
these amounts are estimates  consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
