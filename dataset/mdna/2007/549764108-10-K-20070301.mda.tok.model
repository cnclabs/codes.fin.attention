item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general lufkin industries is a global supplier of oil field  power transmission and trailer products 
through its oil field segment  the company manufactures and services artificial reciprocating rod lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for industrial applications 
through its trailer segment  the company manufactures various highway trailers  including van  float and dump trailers 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s strategy is to differentiate its products through additional value added capabilities 
examples of these capabilities are high quality engineering  customized designs  rapid manufacturing response to demand through plant capacity  inventory and vertical integration  superior quality and customer service  and an international network of service locations 
in addition  the company s strategy is to maintain a low debt to equity ratio in order to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities and pay dividends even during unfavorable business cycles 
in support of the above strategy  the company has been making capital investments in oil field to increase manufacturing capacity and capabilities in its three main manufacturing facilities in lufkin  texas  canada and argentina 
these investments should reduce production lead times and improve quality 
investments also continue to be made to expand the company s presence in automation products and international service  as with the recently opened service facility in oman 
in power transmission  the company continues to expand its gear repair network by opening and expanding facilities in various locations in the us and canada 
the company is making targeted capital investments to expand capacity and reduce manufacturing lead times as well as certain capital investments targeting cost reductions 
trends outlook oilfield demand for pumping unit equipment primarily depends on the level of onshore oil well drilling activity as well as the depth and fluid conditions of that drilling 
drilling activity is driven by the available cash flow of the company s customers as well as their long term perceptions of the level and stability of the price of oil 
the recent demand for pumping units has also been impacted by the use of artificial lift in natural gas and coal bed methane applications as higher energy prices have made certain extraction methods more economical 
in addition  the availability of used pumping unit equipment impacts the demand for new pumping units  especially in the north american market 
the higher energy prices experienced since have increased the demand for new pumping units and related service and products from higher drilling activity  activation of idle wells and the upgrading of existing wells 
lower average energy prices in the latter half of caused some reduced activity levels in the north american market 
while a majority of the segment s revenues are in north america  international opportunities continue to increase as new drilling increases and existing fields mature  requiring increased use of pumping units for artificial lift 
despite recent lower energy prices  general demand levels experienced in are expected to continue throughout  assuming energy prices stay at recent levels 
power transmission power transmission services many diverse markets  with high speed gearing for markets such as petrochemicals  refineries  offshore production and transmission of oil and slow speed gearing for the gas  rubber  sugar  paper  steel  plastics  mining  cement and marine propulsion  each of which has its own unique set of drivers 
favorable conditions for one market may be unfavorable for another market 
generally  if general global industrial capacity utilizations are not high  then spending on new equipment lags 
also impacting demand are government regulations involving safety and environmental issues that can require capital spending 
recent market demand increases have come from energy related markets such as refining  petrochemical  drilling  coal and power generation in response to higher global energy prices 
despite recent lower energy prices  these market trends are expected to continue throughout  assuming energy prices stay at recent levels 
trailer the company primarily sells its trailer products in the united states to small and medium size fleet freight hauling companies through a dealer network 
demand in this market is driven by the available cash flow or financing capabilities of the industry  age of the trailer fleets  changes in government regulations  availability of quality used trailers and the medium term outlook for freight volumes 
the profitability of the freight hauling market is driven by freight volumes  fuel prices  wage levels and insurance costs 
during and  the freight market improved after several years of low volumes and higher operating cost 
freight hauling demand and freight pricing increased and aging trailers required replacement 
however  the recent demand for van trailers has not increased enough to meet trailer industry capacity  increasing price competition 
van demand has been impacted by freight haulers focusing purchases on new tractors before new diesel emission requirements are required on new tractors beginning in in light of these market conditions  the company decided in the third quarter of not to participate in the van market until market conditions support better operating margins 
the company plans to redeploy certain personnel and equipment to increase the manufacturing capacity of flatbed and dump trailers 
recent flatbed and dump trailer demand has increased significantly due to the increased activity in the home and road construction markets and the rebuilding effort resulting from the hurricanes 
summary of results the company generally monitors its performance through analysis of sales  gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales and net earnings  as well as debt equity levels  short term debt levels  and cash balances 
overall  sales for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december   or 
sales for were million 
this growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of new oil field equipment  but also by growth in power transmission sales 
additional segment data on sales is provided later in this section 
gross margin for the year ended december   increased to from for the year ended december   and for year ended december  this overall gross margin improvement from was primarily due to price increases in late and to compensate for the increased raw material prices experienced by all segments in and the benefit of higher production volumes on fixed cost coverage 
the gross margin improvement in over was primarily related to certain cost reductions related to capital expenditures and improved margins in power transmission due to increased sales of higher margin energy related high speed units 
additional segment data on gross margin is provided later in this section 

table of contents the changes in sales and gross margin primarily drove the changes in net earnings  but net earnings also benefited from leverage on selling  general and administrative expenses and a lower total tax rate 
the net tax rate in was lowered to due to the benefits of r e tax credits  current and deferred state tax rate adjustments and other estimate revisions 
the company reported net earnings of million or per share diluted for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million or per share diluted for the year ended december  net income of million or per share diluted was reported for the year ended december  debt equity long term debt net of current portion as a percentage of total equity levels were as of december   december  and december  short term debt was million at december   down from million at december  cash balances at december   were million  up from million at december   due to higher net earnings offsetting increased capital expenditures  working capital growth and higher dividends 
other events in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded certain expenses related to the previously announced decision not to participate in the trailer van market due to current market conditions 
these expenses of approximately million pre tax relate to equipment idled but not disposed and the estimated loss on disposal of van related inventory 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s sales and gross profit by operating segment in thousands of dollars increase increase year ended december decrease decrease sales oil field power transmission trailer total gross profit oil field power transmission trailer total oil field oil field sales increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the benefit of the stronger canadian dollar in and new service centers contributed percentage points of this increase 
increased sales of new pumping units accounted for a majority of the balance of the increase of percentage points 
sales of new pumping units and related service  increased from higher drilling and production primarily in the north america and middle east markets 
also  sales of automation equipment continued to increase due to market share growth from new product offerings 
sales growth also was impacted from price increases instituted throughout in response to dramatic raw material price increases experienced in in addition to price increases instituted in oil field s backlog remained at million as of december   from million at december  despite higher sales volumes  backlog levels have not increased due to a targeted effort to reduce lead times through higher manufacturing capacity 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales for the oil field segment increased to for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
gross margins benefited from certain cost reduction related to capital expenditures and the full year impact of price increases instituted in this margin improvement was partially offset by employee training and other expansion related costs associated with manufacturing facility expansions in the us  canada and argentina and higher inbound freight costs 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased current and expected sales volumes  third party commissions and the impact of expensing stock options 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained at for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  power transmission sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this growth was the result of increased sales of high speed units to the energy related markets  such as power generation and oil and gas production and refining  and from the new gear repair facilities 
power transmission backlog at december   increased to million from million at december   primarily from sales of new units for the energy related markets 
gross margin for the power transmission segment increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   from the benefit of price increases and from increased sales of higher margin high speed units  partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead costs 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales volumes and the impact of expensing stock options 
however  direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   from leverage on higher sales volumes 
trailer trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million  or  from million for the year ended december  higher sales of new flatbed and dump trailers was offset by lower sales of new van trailers and used trailers 
sales growth in flatbed and dump trailers was strong due to the introduction of new models and demand from the home and road construction market 
new van sales were impacted by the company not booking lower margin orders as competitors have lowered prices in response to industry manufacturing overcapacity and trucking industry issues such as soft freight demand and driver shortages 
in light of current conditions in the trailer van market  the company has declined to take additional orders for van trailers in order to expand manufacturing capacity for the production of flatbed and dump trailers and will be converting part of the trailer factory to the production of oil field equipment 
backlog for the trailer segment decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the backlog decrease was primarily from lower van trailer backlog related to the decision to not take additional van trailer orders  partially offset by increased orders for new flatbed trailers  as described above 
trailer gross margin increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   or percentage points 
excluding the impact of the van related equipment and inventory expenses described above  margins would have improved approximately an additional percentage pints 
this increase was due to higher selling prices for  and the favorable mix impact of  higher margin flatbed and dump trailers  partially offset by increases in aluminum costs for van trailers and plant inefficiencies from flatbed and dump trailer production ramp up 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer decreased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  in  bad debt expense was increased due to a disputed receivable 
this also caused direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  corporate other corporate administrative expenses  which are allocated to the segments primarily based on historical third party revenues  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily from the impact of expensing stock options and higher employee related expenses 
interest income  interest expense and other income and expense for the year ended december   totaled million of income compared to income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances 
pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales  increased to million for the year ended december   or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to higher expected returns from increased asset balances 
pension income in is expected to increase slightly to million 
the net tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the year ended december  this lower net tax rate was the result of several items 
a tax initiative to claim research and experimentation tax credits for the through tax years and the recent legislation passed to allow a research and experimentation tax credit for the tax year produced a significant benefit to the tax rate 
a lower effective state tax rate  and the related benefit to deferred tax balances  combined with the favorable impact on state deferred tax balances due to the new texas margin tax also produced a benefit to the net tax rate 
other items such as the lower international tax rates and revisions to prior period estimates produced additional benefits to the net tax rate 
the effective tax rate in is expected to return to an approximate level

year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s sales and gross profit by operating segment in thousands of dollars increase increase year ended december decrease decrease sales oil field power transmission trailer total gross profit oil field power transmission trailer total oil field oil field sales increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the added sales from acquisitions and the benefit of the stronger canadian dollar in contributed percentage points of this increase 
increased sales of new pumping units account for a majority of the balance of the increase of percentage points 
sales of new pumping units in the us  canada and argentina  and related service  increased from higher drilling and production 
also  sales of automation equipment continued to increase due to market share growth from new product offerings 
in addition  sales growth was impacted from price increases instituted throughout and in response to dramatic raw material price increases experienced in oil field s backlog increased to million as of december   from million at december  this backlog increase was from increased bookings of new pumping units in the us  canada and argentina markets 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the oil field segment increased to for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
during  higher raw material prices  especially steel  and higher fuel prices in the service operations impacted margins 
throughout and  sales prices were increased to recover these higher material costs  contributing to the improved gross margin in direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales volumes 
however  direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   from leverage on higher sales volumes 
power transmission sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this growth was the result of increased sales of high speed units to the energy related markets  such as power generation and refining  and low speed unit sales to the steel and sugar markets 
the growth from the new gear repair facilities also contributed to the sales increase 
the company s power transmission backlog at december   increased to million from million at december   primarily from new high speed units and gear repair for the reasons noted above 
gross margin for the power transmission segment increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this increase resulted from the favorable impact of higher volumes on plant efficiencies and fixed cost coverage as well as from the benefit of increased selling prices 
also  increased inter segment production in support of the oil field segment provided additional manufacturing volume that contributed to improved gross margins 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased million to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales volumes 
however  direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   from leverage on higher sales volumes 
trailer trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million  or  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher sales of all models of new trailers 
freight industry demand has continued to improve due to replacement trailer demand and from increases in freight volume levels 
sales growth in flatbeds was particularly strong due to the introduction of new models and demand from the construction market 
backlog for the trailer segment increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the backlog increase was primarily from orders for new van and flatbed trailers for the reasons mentioned above 
trailer gross margin increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this margin improvement was due to higher selling prices on new trailers and the favorable mix impact of higher margin flatbed and dump trailers  partially offset by plant inefficiencies from flatbed and dump trailer production ramp up and late supplier deliveries 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   from higher bad debt expense associated with an account receivable that had been in dispute 
in the fourth quarter of  the dispute was settled and the receivable was converted to a note 
however  the note has been fully reserved until the note holder establishes an acceptable credit status 
despite these higher expenses  direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   from leverage on higher sales volumes 
corporate other corporate administrative expenses  which are allocated to the segments primarily based on historical third party revenues  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily from higher employee related and audit expenses 
investment income  interest expense and other income and expense for the year ended december   totaled million of income compared to expense of million for the year ended december   due to an increase in investment income 
pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales  decreased to million for the year ended december   or  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower expected returns on plan assets from lowering the expected return rate from to  from lowering the discount rate from to for the first nine months of and to for the last three months of and from higher benefits granted to bargaining employees in the new three year collective bargaining agreement signed october  pension income in is expected to decrease to approximately million primarily due to the full year impact of lowering the discount rate to and the higher benefits granted 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation rate are not projected to change from and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ending december   was compared to for the year ended december   due primarily to the lower percentage impact of permanent differences due to higher pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically relied on cash flows from operations and third party borrowing to finance its operations  including acquisitions  dividend payments and stock repurchases 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and its available borrowing capacity under its credit agreements will be sufficient to fund its operations  including planned capital expenditures  dividend payments and stock repurchases  through december  the company s cash balance totaled million at december   compared to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities totaled million and net cash used in financing activities amounted to million 
significant components of cash provided by operating activities included net earnings  adjusted for non cash expenses  of million and an increase in working capital of million 
this working capital increase was primarily due to higher inventory balances  which used million  primarily from increased oil field inventory related to higher sales volumes compared to the prior year and from higher receivable balances  which used million  due to higher sales volumes in all segments in the last quarter of compared to the last quarter of these increases were partially offset by increased other accrued liabilities balances  which provided million  primarily from higher customer installment payments 
net cash used in investing activities included net capital expenditures totaling million and an increase in other assets of million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for the expansion of manufacturing capacity and efficiency improvements in the oil field and power transmission segments 
capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately to million  primarily for the expansion of manufacturing capacity and efficiency improvements in the oil field and power transmission segments and will be funded by operating cash flows 
significant components of net cash used by financing activities included the repayment of short term notes payable of million and dividend payments of million  or per share  partially offset by the impact of stock option exercises  including the excess tax benefit from actual gains on stock option exercises  of million 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt associated with the bank facility discussed below 
total debt decreased by million from short term note repayments during the year ended december the company has a three year million credit facility with a domestic bank the bank facility consisting of an unsecured revolving line of credit that provides up to million of committed borrowing along with an additional million discretionary line of credit 
this bank facility expires on december  borrowing under the bank facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the greater of i the prime rate  ii the base cd rate plus an applicable margin or iii the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin or the london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin  depending on certain ratios as defined in the bank facility 
as of december   no debt was outstanding under the bank facility and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the terms of the bank facility 
deducting outstanding letters of credit of million  million of borrowing capacity was available at december  the company currently has a stock repurchase plan under which the company was authorized to spend up to million for repurchases of its common stock 
pursuant to this plan  the company has repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million

no shares were repurchased in as of december   the company held  shares of treasury stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
authorizations of approximately million remained at december  the following table summarizes the company s expected cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments as of december  information on recurring purchases of materials for use in manufacturing and service operations has not been included 
these amounts are not long term in nature less than three months and are generally consistent from year to year 
in thousands of dollars payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures total since the company has no significant tax loss carryforwards  the company expects to make quarterly estimated tax payments in based on taxable income levels 
also  the company has various qualified retirement plans for which the company has committed a certain level of benefit 
the company expects to make contributions to its pension plans of approximately million and to its post retirement health and life plans of approximately million in  depending on participation levels in these plans 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in accordance with fin  the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step requires determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination or appeals based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step requires that a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable and or an increase in a deferred tax liability 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is met and previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   but earlier adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
sfas defines the funded status of a benefit plan as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans 
previously unrecognized items such as gains or losses  prior service credits and transition assets or liabilities will be recognized in other comprehensive income and will be subsequently recognized through net periodic benefit cost pursuant to the provisions of statements and employers with issued equity securities must recognize the funded status of postretirement plans as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  on december   the company adopted sfas the incremental effect of applying sfas on individual line items of the balance sheet is disclosed in footnote management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated condensed financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in some cases  a customer is not able to take delivery of a completed product and requests that the company store the product for defined period of time 
the company will process a bill and hold invoice and recognize revenue at the time of the storage request if all of the following criteria are met the customer has accepted title and risk of loss  the customer has provided a written purchase order for the product  the customer  not the company  requested the product to be stored and to be invoiced under a bill and hold arrangement 
the customer must also provide the business purposes for the storage request  the customer must provide a storage period and future shipping date  the company must not have retained any future performance obligations on the product  the company must segregate the stored product and not make it available to use on other orders  and the product must be completed and ready for shipment 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
generally  annual increases in the inflation rate or the fifo value of inventory cause the value of the lifo reserve to increase 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  such as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company s fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows  which requires management to make judgments about future operating results  working capital requirements and capital spending levels 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in a determination that goodwill is impaired and a corresponding impairment charge 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers defined benefit plans and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following estimated impact on results pension other thousands of dollars benefits benefits discount rate effect of change on net periodic benefit cost income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company s accounts receivable are not concentrated in one customer or industry and are not viewed as an unusual credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
due to the lack of current debt  the company does not have any significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations
