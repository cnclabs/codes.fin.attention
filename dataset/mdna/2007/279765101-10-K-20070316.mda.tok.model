we continue to focus on growing our subscription and corporate customer base while maintaining stringent cost controls 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase from net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  this is primarily due to continued increases in sales and marketing and product development expenses related to our i metrix suite of products 
capital expenditures  primarily for computers and equipment  totaled  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  the purchases were made to support our expansion and increased infrastructure 
in connection with our acquisition of fis in october  we issued  in promissory notes to the former owners of fis 
the notes were originally scheduled to mature on october  in march  we extended the maturity date of the notes such that the holders of  in principal amount of the notes agreed to amend and restate their notes to provide for  among other things  the following schedule of principal payments  on april    on april  and  on january  all payments have been made and no further obligations remain under these notes 
in may  we sold  units for per unit in a public offering 
each unit consisted of two shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock 
an additional  units were sold to cover over allotments 
of the  shares of our common stock included in the over allotment units   were offered by a selling stockholder and we did not receive any proceeds from that portion of the over allotment 
we also issued to the underwriter of the public offering a warrant to purchase  units for a price of per unit 
prior to the redemption described below  the warrants issued as part 
table of contents of the units had an exercise price of and were exercisable until may  beginning november   we had the right to redeem some or all of the warrants at a price of per warrant at anytime after the closing price for our common stock equaled or exceeded per share for any five consecutive trading days by giving certain notice to the then warrant holders 
in march  we exercised our redemption rights by sending notices to holders of the outstanding public warrants issued in the may offering 
pursuant to the redemption notice  holders of the public warrants were given the opportunity to exercise their warrants until the close of business on april  after april   we redeemed any unexercised public warrants at a price of per warrant 
as a result   warrants were exercised in march resulting in gross proceeds of  and  warrants were exercised in april resulting in gross proceeds of million 
we paid  to redeem  warrants which were not exercised during the redemption period 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
our future contractual obligations  which consist solely of operating leases  at december   in thousands  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from three primary sources subscriptions to our web services  licenses with corporate customers for customized data  and advertising and other e commerce based revenues 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
revenue from data licenses is recognized over the term of the contract or  in the case of certain up front fees  over the estimated customer relationship period 
advertising and e commerce revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance  and delivery if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 

table of contents several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these evaluations include assumptions regarding future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas  accounting for stock based compensation in our consolidated financial statements 
under sfas r  the company is required to recognize compensation expense for all employee and director stock based compensation awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
the company estimates the fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires the company to make assumptions about the expected life of options  stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend yields 
the company recognizes the expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adopting sfas r  the company estimated expected forfeitures over the life of each individual award and will included the impact of these expected forfeitures in stock based compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 the company does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
it does not increase the use of fair value measurement 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 
 the company does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we generally invest in short term  low risk instruments 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments
