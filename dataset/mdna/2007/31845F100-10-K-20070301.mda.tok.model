critical accounting estimates first advantage believes the following are the more critical accounting estimates that impact its financial statements 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  management is required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
management s assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
although first advantage believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  financial statement and supplementary data  of this annual report on form k 
basis of presentation and consolidation first advantage s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s operating results for the years ended december   and include results for the acquired entities  excluding the cig business  from their respective dates of acquisition 
the acquisition of the cig business by first advantage is a transaction between businesses under the common control of first american 
in an acquisition of businesses under common control  the acquiring company records acquired assets and liabilities at historical costs 
the historical income statements and statement of cash flows of first advantage for the years ended december   and have been restated to include operations of the cig business at historical cost assuming the acquisition was completed on january  the company uses the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
the consolidated net income includes the company s share of the net earnings of dealertrack 
first advantage s judgment regarding the level of influence over the investment of dealertrack includes considering key factors such as ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  and participation in policy making decisions 
the elimination of intra segment revenue and cost of service revenue is included in corporate 
these transactions are recorded at cost 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of reports and leads is recognized at the time of delivery  as the company has no significant ongoing obligation after delivery 
revenue from investigative and litigation support services is recognized as services are performed 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company includes reimbursed government fees in revenue and in cost of service 
revenue via the eadvertising network of leadclick media  inc is recognized when transactions are completed as evidenced by qualifying actions by end users of the publishers and or advertiser on the proprietary eadvertising network 
revenue as a result of list management services is recognized when transactions are completed as evidenced by qualifying actions of end users 
in most instances  the qualifying action that completes the earnings process is the submission of an on line form that generates a sales lead via the internet 
membership fees  billed monthly to member s accounts  are recognized in the month the fee is earned 
a portion of the membership revenue received is paid in the form of a commission to clients and is reflected in other operating expenses 
revenue earned from providing services to third party issuers of membership based consumer products is recognized at the time the service is provided  generally on a monthly basis 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
custom programming and professional consulting service revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method pursuant to accounting research bulletin arb no 
long term construction type contracts 
to the extent that interim amounts billed to clients exceed revenue earned  deferred income is recorded 
other revenue is recognized upon completion of the contractual obligation  which is typically evidenced by delivery of the product or performance of the service 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all probable uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by management to arrive at an estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may ultimately be uncollectible 
in circumstances where first advantage is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  first advantage records a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
this analysis requires making significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for uncollectible receivables 
capitalized software development costs first advantage capitalizes costs associated with developing software for internal use  which costs primarily include salaries of developers 
direct costs incurred in the development of software are capitalized once the preliminary project stage is completed  management has committed to funding the project and completion and use of the software for its intended purpose are probable 
first advantage ceases capitalization of development costs once the software has been substantially completed at the date of conversion and is ready for its intended use 
the estimation of useful lives requires a significant amount of judgment related to matters  specifically  future changes in technology 
the company believes there have not been any events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
database development costs database development costs represent expenditures associated with first advantage s databases of information for customer usage 
the costs are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is established until the information is ready for use 
the estimation of useful lives requires a significant amount of judgment related to matters such as future changes in technology  legal issues related to allowable uses of data and other matters 
the company believes there have not been any events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets first advantage carries intangible and long lived assets at cost less accumulated amortization where applicable 
accounting standards require that assets be written down if they become impaired 
intangible and long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
at such time that an impairment in value of an intangible or long lived asset is identified  the impairment will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique  which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect the range of possible outcomes and an appropriate discount rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company completed a goodwill impairment test  for the year ending december   for all reporting units 
a valuation date of september  was used for this impairment test and was performed by management 
the test determined that each reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value  therefore  no goodwill impairment was recorded 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgments to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
purchase accounting first advantage completed eleven acquisitions in  fifteen acquisitions in  and fourteen acquisitions in the purchase method of accounting requires companies to assign values to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair values 
in most instances  there is not a readily defined or listed market price for individual assets and liabilities acquired in connection with a business  including intangible assets 
the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in many instances requires a high degree of estimation 
the valuation of intangibles assets  in particular  is very subjective 
first advantage generally uses internal cash flow models and  in certain instances  third party valuations in estimating fair values 
the use of different valuation techniques and assumptions can change the amounts and useful lives assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets and related amortization expense 
amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities as of december  are based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised in the company does not anticipate that revisions to the amounts allocated to acquired assets and liabilities  if any  will be significant to the company s financial statements

r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
the cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  results of prior periods are not restated 
share based compensation expense for the twelve months ended december  was million million after tax or per basic and diluted share 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of the company s stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock options exercise behaviors 
management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share base compensation 
income taxes the company estimates its effective income tax rate based upon a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the expected revenues and resulting pretax income for the year  the composition and geographic mix of the pretax income and the ratio of permanent differences to pretax income 
any changes to the estimated rate are made prospectively in accordance with accounting board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
additionally  management makes estimates as to the amount of reserves  if any  that are necessary for known and potential tax exposures 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no
