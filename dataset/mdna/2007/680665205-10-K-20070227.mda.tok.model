item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially impact our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our manufacturing operations are concentrated in three business segments chlor alkali products  metals  and winchester 
all three are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with operating rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
while a majority of metals sales are of a commodity nature  this business has a significant volume of specialty engineered products targeted for specific end uses 
in these applications  technical capability and performance differentiate the product and play a role in product selection and thus price is not the only selection criterion 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year on february   we announced that  in connection with the ongoing cost reduction efforts of our metals business  we decided to close our waterbury rolling mills brass manufacturing facility in waterbury  ct waterbury facility and consolidate those production activities into our east alton  il mill 
in addition  on march   we decided to reduce the utilization of one of our metals service center facilities by consolidating certain activities into another service center facility  and make overhead reductions in the metals business affecting approximately employees 
we based our decision on our evaluation of the size  location  and capability of our facilities and staffing in light of anticipated business needs 
we substantially completed these activities by june  as a result of these cost reduction efforts  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of million in the first quarter 
in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of realizing more proceeds from equipment sales than expected  we reduced our previously established restructuring reserve related to the waterbury facility by million 
the net restructuring charge of million primarily included lease and other contract termination costs million  write off of equipment and facility costs million  and employee severance and related benefit costs million 
we expect to incur cash expenditures of million related to this restructuring charge 
these actions are expected to generate million to million of annual pretax savings  and the implementation of these actions was cash neutral in the impact of this restructuring charge was substantially offset by a last in  first out lifo inventory liquidation gain of million realized related to the closure of our waterbury facility 
on november   we announced that  in connection with the ongoing cost reduction efforts of our metals business  we decided to close our new haven copper company facility in seymour  ct seymour facility and consolidate some of those production activities into other olin locations 
we currently expect to complete the closing of the seymour facility during the second quarter of we based our decision on our evaluation of the size  location  and capability of our facilities and staffing in light of anticipated business needs 
we recorded a one time pretax restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter 
this restructuring charge included facility costs and equipment write offs million  employee severance and related benefit costs million  and other contract termination costs million 
we expect to incur cash expenditures of million related to this restructuring 
these actions are expected to generate million of annual pretax savings 
the impact of this restructuring charge was more than offset by a lifo inventory liquidation gain of million realized related to the closure of our seymour facility 
our total restructuring charge for was million 
it is expected that an additional restructuring charge of approximately million will be recorded in associated with these metals restructuring actions

as a result  income tax expense in was reduced by million associated with the settlement and other tax matters 
on june   we commenced an offer to exchange a new series of notes due in and cash for up to million of the million senior notes due in notes 
on july   we announced that approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes had been validly tendered for exchange 
since more than million of the notes had been tendered  the new notes were issued on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer 
on july   we issued million of senior notes due in notes and paid a premium of million to the existing note holders in exchange for million of notes 
we expensed million of third party fees associated with the exchange 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million insurance recovery for hurricane katrina business interruption experienced in our chlor alkali products operations in and early in the second quarter of  we recorded a million gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to the fire that occurred in the electrical control room at the hot mill located in east alton  il 
year during  we received a total of million from real estate dispositions  including interest of million 
the first disposition in march represented the settlement of a condemnation award relating to land associated with a former warehousing facility 
the other two transactions represented the disposition of land associated with former manufacturing plants 
during  we recovered environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods and related interest of million from third parties  which relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations 
the first recovery in april was for million 
the second occurred in september and was for million 
the last occurred in november and was for million  which included million in interest 
during the third quarter of  both supply and demand in the chlor alkali industry were interrupted by three hurricanes  which caused customer outages and disruptions to the transportation system

by the end of  we had completed the relocation of a portion of our corporate services personnel from norwalk  ct to our main office building in east alton  il 
we also established our new corporate headquarters in clayton  which is in st 
louis county  mo  for logistical and other reasons 
the relocation of the corporate offices was accompanied by a downsized corporate structure more appropriate for us in today s competitive business environment 
the headquarters relocation was completed by the end of the majority of the corporate personnel have been co located with the brass and winchester businesses resulting in 
table of contents corporate headcount being reduced by approximately forty percent  generating total projected annual savings of approximately million in as a result of the relocation  we incurred costs of million in and incurred an additional million of costs in this restructuring charge included primarily employee severance and related benefit costs  relocation expense  pension curtailment expense and the incurred cost for outplacement services for all affected employees 
the sale of the indianapolis facility in november resulted in a reduction of a previously established reserve related to our indianapolis restructuring of million  which reduced the total restructuring charge to million 
on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds from the sale were million and were used to make a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan 
in march  we used million from the proceeds of the stock offering to repay the illinois industrial pollution control revenue bond  which became due in march of the remaining balance million of the proceeds was used in april to pay a portion of federal income taxes related to prior periods 
in  we were accepted to participate in the irs settlement initiative pertaining to tax issues related to our benefits liability management company 
in addition  we settled with the irs relative to our company owned life insurance coli program 
in the third quarter of  a final settlement agreement was reached with the irs on these and certain other outstanding issues related to tax audits covering the through tax years 
in connection with these settlements we made payments in the second quarter of of million 
these payments resolved all open issues regarding our benefits liability management company and our coli program 
these tax issues had been recorded as a liability prior to in the third quarter of  the income tax provision included a million reduction in income tax expense associated with the finalization  in the third quarter of  of the settlement of certain issues related to income tax audits for the years through on april   a fire occurred in the electrical control room for the hot mill located in east alton  il 
the hot mill was returned to full operation in mid may 
the full year costs relative to the fire were incurred by the metals segment in the second quarter and were million pretax 
in june  we sold our olin aegis business to hcc industries inc olin aegis  headquartered in new bedford  ma  is a manufacturer of high performance  high reliability  hermetic metal packages for the microelectronics industry 
olin aegis employed people 
the sale of our olin aegis business resulted in a pretax gain of million and generated proceeds of million 
for olin aegis  the financial data is classified in our financial statements as discontinued operations for the periods presented prior to on july   we entered into a million five year senior revolving credit facility that replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
this credit facility expires on july  borrowing options  restrictive covenants and the letter of credit subfacility are similar to or better than those of the previous senior revolving credit facility 
in september  we were impacted by equipment problems and a hurricane at our mcintosh  al chlor alkali facility 
we invoked the force majeure clause in the chlorine contracts with our customers due to equipment problems and invoked the force majeure clause in the chlorine  caustic soda  hydrogen  salt and sodium hypochlorite contracts with our customers due to the effects of the hurricane 
the negative impact of these issues was several million dollars 
the plant returned to full operation in late september 
in september  winchester announced that it would relocate its east alton rimfire manufacturing operation to oxford  ms to allow winchester the ability to reduce costs  improve efficiencies  better utilize existing technology and achieve improved profitability in the product line 
this move was completed in the second quarter this relocation impacted approximately salaried and hourly employees  but did not impact the shotshell  centerfire rifle  and pistol manufacturing operations  which are located in east alton  il

metal foils llc is a distributor of aluminum  stainless steel  and copper products located in willoughby  oh 
we relocated the purchased assets to our aj oster facility in alliance  oh in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents pension and postretirement benefits under sfas no 
 we recorded a million after tax charge million pretax to shareholders equity as of december   reflecting an accumulated pension benefit obligation in excess of the year end market value of assets of our pension plan 
in  the decline in interest rates more than offset a significant rebound in the value of the plan s assets  which necessitated the recording of an additional after tax charge of million million pretax 
on february   we made a voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in september  we made a second voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan 
these voluntary contributions improved the funded status of the pension plan 
in addition  the contributions eliminated a pbgc variable rate premium of million that would have otherwise become payable from the pension plan assets in in  the decline in interest rates resulted in a basis point discount rate reduction that more than offset the increases in the value of the plan s assets 
therefore  we recorded in december an additional after tax charge of million million pretax as a result of an increase in the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
in september  we made a voluntary pension plan contribution of million in order to maintain a funded level under the employee retirement income and security act erisa criteria used to determine funding levels 
in  an additional basis point decline in interest rates and the cost impact of contractual pension plan changes more than offset the increase in the value of the plan assets 
therefore  we recorded in december an additional after tax charge of million million pretax as a result of an increase in the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
in september  we made a voluntary pension plan contribution of million 
in  we recorded an after tax credit of million million pretax to shareholders equity as a result of a decrease in the accumulated pension benefit obligation  which primarily resulted from a basis point increase in the plan discount rate  combined with an increase in the value of the plan assets from favorable plan performance and the contribution 
in we adopted sfas no 
 which required us to record a net liability to report the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our balance sheet 
as a result  we recorded after tax charges to shareholders equity of million and million for the pension and other postretirement plans  respectively  million and million pretax  respectively 
the non cash charges to shareholders equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
based on revised assumptions and estimates  we believe no mandatory contributions will be required until we may elect to make selective voluntary contributions  when appropriate 
during the third quarter of  the pension protection act of became law 
among the stated objectives of the law are the protection of both pension beneficiaries and the financial health of the pbgc 
to accomplish these objectives  the new law requires sponsors to fund defined benefit pension plans earlier than previous requirements and to pay increased pbgc premiums 
the impact of the law cannot be fully assessed until all the implementation rules are published but the law does require defined benefit plans to be fully funded in this will accelerate and potentially increase our pension plan funding requirements

outlook earnings in the first quarter of are projected to be in the cents per diluted share range 
in chlor alkali products  we expect both first quarter shipment volumes and pricing to be lower than the first quarter of we experienced a seasonal decline in chlorine demand during the fourth quarter which has continued into the first quarter of during the fourth quarter  a per ton caustic soda price increase was announced  a portion of which we expect to implement during the first quarter 
the reduced industry operating rates experienced in the fourth quarter and increased caustic exports have tightened domestic caustic supply 
in the first quarter of  we expect to see some decline in our ecu netbacks from the fourth quarter but expect ecu netbacks to be flat in the first half of and we anticipate some gradual  but not significant  decline in the second half of in the metals business  we expect lower volumes to be offset by higher pricing 
we expect the first quarter metals earnings to be comparable with the first quarter of winchester results are expected to improve from the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily due to improved pricing and increased volumes partially offset by higher commodity costs 
winchester has announced eight price increases since the beginning of the last of these increases was effective december  commodity material prices are likely to continue to challenge winchester in the price of copper has moderated some during january  but the price of lead has continued to increase 
the january spot price for lead has been cents per pound  compared to a spot price in the first quarter of of cents 
winchester consumes approximately four times as much lead as copper annually 
we expect winchester s military sales to increase from levels 
we expect pension expense to decrease to approximately million from million in this decline reflects the combination of a basis point increase in the discount rate  the voluntary million pension contribution made in  favorable performance on plan assets in  and the transition of a portion of the metals and winchester hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
the first quarter of pension expense is expected to decline approximately million 
we expect to record million of additional charges in associated with metals restructuring actions 
during  we will continue to address the cost structure in our metals business 
we have initiated an aggressive inventory reduction program  which has the objective of reducing inventory balances by over the next two years 
these reductions  which will be in addition to the reductions realized in  are expected to produce additional inventory liquidation gains  the exact amount of which will reflect market prices for copper and zinc 
we believe the effective tax rate will be in the to range 
this reduced rate reflects an increase in the us manufacturing credit contained in the jobs creation act of from to in we are currently forecasting capital spending to be in the to million range  approximately of which will be directed at the chlor alkali business 
the capital spending will include the completion of the bleach expansion projects and ongoing maintenance projects which are not expected to cause outages in our chlor alkali products operations 
finally  during the first quarter of  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for chlorine railcars that we acquired in and this transaction reduced our fixed assets by approximately million

total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality has affected and will continue to affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
environmental provisions credits charged credited to income were as follows in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total provision credit 
table of contents these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our estimated environmental liability at the end of was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at two of these ten sites a remedial plan has been submitted by us and a record of decision rod or its equivalent has not been issued 
at three of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at two of the sites  part of the site is subject to remedial action and another part is in the long term om m stage 
one site is at the investigatory stage 
the two remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the ten largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities  respectively 
those amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a 
risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties prps  and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher spending for the completion of the bleach expansion projects in our chlor alkali products operations and ongoing major maintenance and replacement projects  which are not expected to cause outages at our chlor alkali products facilities

liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
we also have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected recently by economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as vinyls  urethanes  pulp and paper  automotive  electronics  housing  and the telecommunications sectors 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity 
in addition  cash flow from operating activities is affected by the prices of copper and zinc 
for example  assuming metals segment shipment volumes remain the same  a per pound change in the metal prices results in an approximate million change in our investment in working capital

our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if the sunbelt joint venture does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of the sunbelt joint venture for repayment

these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more or less than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year in the case of pensions 
it is likely we will make cash payments in future periods 
see discussion on pension protection act of in pension plans and retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  discount rates  and comparable company trading multiples 
based on our evaluation prepared in the fourth quarter of  no impairment charge was recorded 
environmental accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 

table of contents environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension  respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
additionally  gains and losses are amortized over the group s service lifetime  to the extent they fall outside of a corridor designed to dampen annual volatility 
the average remaining service lives of the employee plan is years 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the group  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased  respectively  the pension cost by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension costs by million and the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension costs by million and the projected benefit obligation by million 
for additional information on long term rates of return  discount rates and projected healthcare costs projections  see pension plans and retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires that a company recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pensions and other postretirement plans on its balance sheet and measure benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the company s balance sheet date 
the portion of this statement related to recognizing a net liability for the funded status became effective for fiscal years ending after december  at december   we recorded an after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive income of million million pretax 
the measurement date of the assets and benefit obligations requirements will be effective for fiscal years ending after december  we currently use our year end balance sheet date as our measurement date and  as a result  the new measurement requirement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather  it provides enhanced guidance to other pronouncements that require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relates to the definition of fair value  the methods used to estimate fair value  and the requirement for expanded disclosures about estimates of fair value 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
it is expected that this statement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issues fasb staff position fsp no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  which amends certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide  audits of airlines and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
this position prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods 
this position becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented 
it is expected that this statement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatement when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

the bulletin provides guidance on assessing the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab no 
requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

this interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of fin no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
derivative financial instruments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 

table of contents we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december   we had no forward contracts to buy or to sell foreign currencies 
at december  we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with a face value of million and no forward contracts to sell foreign currencies 
the fair market value of the forward contracts to buy at december   approximated the carrying value 
the counterparty to the forward contracts was a large financial institution 
the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty would not be significant to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange gains  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in we use cash flow hedges of certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding fixed rate debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
gains losses on settled futures contracts  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in at december   we had open positions in futures contracts totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a gain of million 
at december  and  accumulated other comprehensive loss included a pretax gain in fair value of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in million  million and million charge credit to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
offsetting the above  there were in assets totaling million million and liabilities of million million 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting 
the effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for the years   and was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities  our ongoing investing and financing activities  and our operations that use foreign currencies 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our metals and winchester segments products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our existing debt structure is used to fund business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in all cases the underlying 
table of contents index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the term of the swap is the same as the underlying debt instrument 
assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact interest expense by million on an annualized pretax basis 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations as of december  underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  floating rate in millions  due december  due march a industrial development and environmental improvement obliga tions at fixed interest rates of to  due march march a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense  resulting in an increase in pretax profit of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in july  we received proceeds of million for the termination of a million interest rate swap that was a fair value hedge for a portion of the million notes that were part of the july debt exchange 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
