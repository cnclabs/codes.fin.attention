item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a nationwide  mall based specialty retailer of lifestyle sportswear and dresses targeting style conscious women 
our merchandise offerings extend from elegant eveningwear to sophisticated casual and daytime sportswear  which encompasses a variety of tops  bottoms  dresses and accessories  all of which are sold under our cache brand 
we believe the appeal of our merchandise is enhanced through the intimate boutique like environment we offer to our customers 
this environment is achieved through a high level of customer service combined with our smaller store format  which averages approximately  square feet 
we target women between the ages of and through our differentiated merchandising mix and exciting cache and cache luxe store environments 
our brand appeals to a woman who has a youthful attitude  is self confident and fashion conscious  and requires a missy fit 
our sportswear embodies a mix of lifestyle separates for both day and evening 
our stores carry a diverse range of merchandise  which includes dresses for daytime and evening  and continues to be an important dress resource and destination for our target customers 
our accessories complement the seasonal themes and palettes of our sportswear and dresses 
in may  we announced plans to introduce a new concept  cache luxe  and exit our lillie rubin business 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we converted lillie rubin locations to cache luxe stores 
in addition  we expanded three cache stores by combining them into three adjacent lillie rubin stores and added cache luxe merchandise to these cache stores 
our three remaining lillie rubin store locations are expected to be closed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of our cache luxe concept primarily focuses on our daytime and evening merchandise 
this concept is expected to broaden our customer base  enable us to offer a larger selection of evening apparel and accessories at higher price points and allows us to leverage our marketing under a single cache brand 
in addition  cache stores located in malls containing a cache luxe store have increased capacity to offer an expanded casual assortment 
almost all of our current cache luxe stores are in malls that also contain a cache store 
for the fiscal year ended december   sportswear accounted for  dresses for and accessories for of cache s net sales 
cache s price points range from to for sportswear  to for dresses and to for accessories 
our new cache luxe stores generally have higher price points than our cache stores 
as of december   we operated cache and cache luxe stores  primarily situated in central locations in high traffic  upscale shopping malls  in states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
management overview fiscal represents the company s sixteenth consecutive profitable year 
fiscal marked a year in which we positioned cache to report sustained growth in sales and profitability 
during the fall  with our merchandise assortments resonating with our core customers  and the exit of lillie rubin substantially complete  we began to implement marketing initiatives aimed at increasing customer loyalty and awareness of our cache brand 
we also extended cache s reach by appealing to a higher income consumer with the launch of cache luxe 
finally  we began to take advantage of sourcing opportunities that have already produced higher gross margins for our company 
nonetheless  we were disappointed in our fourth quarter performance  as we did not experience the expected lift in sales during late december 
as a result  we were unable to offset our investment in marketing 
in fiscal  the company focused on its sourcing strategy after hiring an executive vice president of production and sourcing in february to lead this initiative 
the merchandising team had in the past also been responsible for sourcing 
we believe that having a separate area  responsible for this integral process  will enhance consistent flow and quality of product 
the company opened cache stores in fiscal and closed seven cache stores 
operating cash flow funded all store openings 
in fiscal  we intend to open approximately cache stores  also intended to be funded by operating cash flow 
in fiscal  the company remodeled cache stores  approximately of the chain is now in the new format 
in fall  the company introduced an upgrade to its pos system for all locations 
the upgraded system  which provides many productivity enhancements  also will allow the company to launch a customer loyalty program in  which will complement the company s direct marketing initiatives 
we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance to evaluate the performance of our business  some of which are forth in the following table weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended january  december  december  operating results total store count  at end of period net sales growth comparable store sales growth net sales per square foot total square footage in thousands net sales 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed 
shipping and handling 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  cost of freight from vendors  costs incurred for shipping and handling  payroll for our design  buying and merchandising personnel and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance and real estate taxes 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses include payroll  payroll taxes  health benefits  insurance  credit card processing fees  depreciation  licenses and taxes as well as marketing and advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include district and regional manager payroll  other corporate personnel payroll and employee benefits  employment taxes  insurance  legal and other professional fees and other corporate level expenses 
corporate level expenses are primarily attributable to our corporate headquarters in new york 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that had been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long lived assets  we perform an analysis by store of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
no impairment charges were incurred in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to a one store  which the company expects to close in early self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
gift cards  gift certificates and credits 
the company sells gift cards and gift certificates gift cards and issues credits to its customers when merchandise is returned 
the company recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer and income when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and the company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as abandoned property 
the company determines gift card breakage income based upon historical redemption patterns 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards  for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
at that time  the company will recognize breakage income for those gift cards 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company formed a new subsidiary to handle all gift card sales and maintain the liability related to gift cards 
as a result of transferring all existing obligations to the newly formed subsidiary  the company recognized million of breakage income  within net sales  in the third quarter related to gift certificates and merchandise credits sold issued since the inception of the gift card program 
an additional  of breakage income was recognized in the fourth quarter of there was no breakage income recognized for the same period in the prior year 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
sales of merchandise via our website are recognized at the expected time of delivery to the customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
charges or credits to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision were approximately   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when tax contingencies become probable  a liability for the contingent amount is estimated based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions  as well as various tax filing positions 
as of december   the company does not have any tax contingencies 
seasonality 
we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during the fourth quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during the third quarter july  august and september 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
weeks weeks weeks ended ended ended january  december  december  operating results net sales cost of sales gross profit store operating expenses general and administrative expenses lillie rubin exit costs operating income other income net income before income taxes income taxes net income weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in comparable store sales  excluding the comparable sales decline for lillie rubin sales 
the increase also included million of breakage income  as a result of the conversion of our gift card system from a paper based to a card based system 
the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable new cache and cache luxe store sales  partially offset by a decrease in lillie rubin sales  due to the exit from this business 
the improvement in net sales was driven by an increase in dress sales  primarily shorter length dresses  as dress sales increased to of total sales from in fiscal accessory sales continued to improve  increasing to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales and increased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher initial margins  resulting from sourcing improvements 
also contributing to higher gross margins in fiscal was a decrease in buying and occupancy expenses of  as a percent of sales  as compared to fiscal store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from 
the increase in store operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in stores opened over the past two years  as well as due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million 
store operating expenses in fiscal were also higher than fiscal  due to higher depreciation expense of million  payroll and related expenses increased million  insurance expense increased  licenses and taxes increased  and utilities increased  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or  above the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from  primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees of million in fiscal payroll related expenses rose approximately million  primarily due to stock based compensation expense of million  resulting from our adoption of fasb r 
the company did not record any stock based compensation expense in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal also increased over fiscal levels  due to higher travel costs of  and telephone expense of  primarily due to expenses associated with the new pos lan network 
other income 
other income increased to million from million  in the prior fiscal year  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during fiscal  as compared to fiscal income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  below the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was attributable to lower taxable income  and was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the higher tax rate was in fiscal  primarily due to a net increase in permanent non deductible operating expenses recorded in fiscal  due to reduced investment in municipal bonds  as well as non deductible incentive stock options and offering costs 
we expect the effective tax rate in fiscal to return to historical levels 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased to million from million  a decrease of million or  below the same period last year 
weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended january  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
fiscal sales included a fifty third week  on a comparable basis  assuming a fifty two week year in both periods  total sales would have risen in fiscal the actual increase in fiscal net sales as compared to fiscal reflects million of additional net sales primarily due to a increase in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales were higher in the second half of fiscal  rising  as compared to a increase during the first half of fiscal this improvement resulted from a change in the merchandise assortment in the second half of fiscal  to reflect a greater proportion of fashion forward merchandise 
the increase in full year fiscal sales were also partially attributable to the increase in accessory sales  which increased to of total sales for our cache stores in fiscal  from of sales in fiscal the remainder of the increase in sales was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase in gross profit was the combined result of higher net sales and an increase in gross profit margins  due to improved inventory management  which led to an increase in initial markup as compared to fiscal partially offsetting the increase in gross margins was an increase in occupancy costs  which rose to of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in new stores opened in late and during we believe it generally takes three years for new stores to reach maturity levels  which provide positive leverage for occupancy costs 
we estimate that excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  gross profit would have risen by an additional approximately in fiscal store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this was due primarily to an increase in the total number of new stores open 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from  primarily due to an increase in payroll expense of million  an increase in licenses and taxes of million rising to of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and an increase in depreciation expense of million rising to of net sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal 
the increases in depreciation and taxes were partially attributable to the increase in new stores  as well as an increase in store remodels 
excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  we estimate that store operating expenses would have risen by approximately in fiscal we anticipate store operating expenses will decrease  as a percent of net sales in future years  as comparable store sales rise in our newer locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increase in corporate level payroll of  as well as an increase in incentive compensation expense of  rising to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and was partially offset by a reduction in travel expense of  decreasing to of net sales in fiscal as compared to is fiscal 
excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  we estimate that general and administrative expenses would have been of net sales 
other income 
other income increased to million from  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates in fiscal  as compared to fiscal other income generally consists of interest income 
we expect interest income to grow in the future due to stronger cash flows from operations 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million from million  a decrease of  below the same period last year 
the overall effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a reversal of overaccrued state income taxes 
an increase in tax free interest from municipal bond investments in the first half of fiscal also contributed to the reduction in effective rate during fiscal refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the income tax provision 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net increased to million from million  as compared to the same period last year 
quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended december  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the construction of new stores and inventory for new stores as well as the remodeling of existing stores 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
cash flows have increased significantly in recent years  due to the dramatic increase in gross margin contribution 
as of december   we had working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
the following table sets forth our cash flows for the period indicated in thousands weeks ended january  weeks ended december  weeks ended december  net cash from operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash from financing activities net decrease  increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  million from non cash lillie rubin exit costs  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  million from non cash stock based compensation and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by accounts payable decrease of million  primarily due to reduction in the number of vendors and the increase in direct purchases paid via letter of credit 
inventories increased million  while we reversed deferred rent of million and recorded in non cash gift card breakage of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred taxes and  an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in deferred taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and a tax benefit of million from stock option exercises  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories of million primarily due to the net increase of stores  reversal of deferred rent of million  and an increase in receivables of million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities  the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores  as well as improvements to the pos system 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises  as well as excess tax benefits from option exercises of million 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to cash provided from the proceeds of common stock issuances 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  primarily due to stock option exercises and stock issuances 
we have a line of credit with bank of america  na  successor in interest to fleet bank  na permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently at february   less the agreement relating to this facility contains selected financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we have at all times been in compliance with all loan covenants 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flow from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due in period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations employment contracts purchase obligations operating leases total payments due in period total within year years years after years in thousands commercial commitments standby letters of credit total we issue standby letters of credit primarily for the importation of merchandise inventories 
the operating leases included in the table on the previous page do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet  if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
