an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income and net interest income totals discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  resulting in tax equivalent adjustments of  and in  and  respectively 
the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution 
the company follows these practices

net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  amounted to million for the year ended december   representing a decline of thousand or  compared with the decline in net interest income was principally attributed to a basis point decline in the net interest margin  which in amounted to 
as is widely the situation throughout the banking industry  the decline in the net interest margin was largely attributed to the seventeen increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve bank from june to june and a flat to inverted yield curve throughout  the impact of which has caused the bank s funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield on its earning asset portfolios 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  amounted to million  representing an increase of thousand or compared with the increase in non interest income was led by a thousand or increase in net realized gains on the sale of securities

new branch office in the first quarter of  the bank opened its twelfth branch office in the community of somesville  maine  further strengthening the bank s dominant presence on mount desert island 
outlook management believes the primary challenge facing the company in is the continuation of a flat to inverted us treasury yield curve  which without substantial change will continue to pressure the bank s net interest margin 
management also believes that meaningful increases net interest income will largely depend on the bank s ability to grow the loan portfolio and continue gathering core deposits 
the bank s credit quality has been remarkably strong over the past few years and the continuation of this trend will be a significant determinant of the company s future financial performance 
given the current interest rate posture of the federal reserve  declining loan demand in the markets served by the bank  intensifying competition for loans and deposits  a slowing real estate market  and softening economic conditions overall  management believes the external challenges facing the company and the banking industry as a whole in may be among the greatest encountered for many years 
other factors  which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  are more fully enumerated in the forward looking statements discussion at the beginning of this annual report on form k and the company s discussion of certain risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses management believes the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income  and when a greater amount of provision for loan losses is necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from historical taxes paid and future taxable income and  to the extent that the recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets the valuation techniques used by the company to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based upon changes in economic conditions and other factors 
any changes in the estimates used by the company to determine the carrying value of its goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  or which otherwise adversely affect their value or estimated lives  may have an adverse effect the company s results of operations 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further details of the company s accounting policies and estimates covering goodwill and other intangible assets

average earning assets represented and of total average assets during and  respectively 
the company  through its management of liabilities  attempts to provide stable and flexible sources of funding within established liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines 
this is accomplished through core deposit products offered within the markets served  as well as through the prudent use of borrowed and brokered funds 
the company s objectives in managing its balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates  and to enhance profitability through strategies that promise sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk 
the company is deliberate in its efforts to maintain adequate liquidity  under prevailing and forecasted economic conditions  and to maintain an efficient and appropriate mix of core deposits  brokered deposits  and borrowed funds

the increase in average earning assets was principally attributed to average loan growth of  or  followed by a  or increase in average securities 
the tax equivalent yield on total average earning assets amounted to in compared with in  representing an increase of basis points 
the increase in earning asset yields was principally attributed to increases in short term interest rates during the year  which favorably impacted the yields on the bank s floating rate loan base 
in addition  new earning assets  as well as cash flows from the securities and loan portfolios  were generally invested into higher yielding earning assets throughout  as the and year us treasury notes climbed to four and five year highs  respectively

investment securities the securities portfolio represented of the company s average earning assets during and generated of total tax equivalent interest and dividend income  compared with and in and  respectively 
bank management considers securities as a relatively attractive means to effectively leverage the bank s strong capital position  as securities are typically assigned a significantly lower risk weighting for the purpose of calculating the bank s and the company s risk based capital ratios 
the securities portfolio is primarily comprised of mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies  us government sponsored enterprises  and other corporate issuers 
the portfolio also includes tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  and obligations of other us government sponsored enterprises 
the overall objectives of the bank s strategy for the securities portfolio include maintaining appropriate liquidity reserves  diversifying earning assets  managing interest rate risk  leveraging the bank s strong capital position  and generating acceptable levels of net interest income 
the investment securities portfolio is managed under the policy guidelines established by the bank s board of directors 
in light of the historically low interest rate environment in prior years  the bank s investment strategy had been principally focused on maintaining the majority of the securities portfolio with a relatively short average duration  thereby limiting some of the exposures associated with sustained increases in interest rates 
the bank s strategy had been to position the majority of the securities portfolio defensively with a steady stream of future cash flows 
while this strategy sacrificed some yield in the near term  the bank s objectives were to maintain a reasonable level of net interest income  manage longer term interest rate and market risks  and position the portfolio for a rising rate environment 
during cash flows generated from pay downs on mortgage backed securities amounted to  the vast majority of which were reinvested into higher yielding securities 
total investment securities at december   total investment securities stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
during market yields showed meaningful improvement  with the year us treasury note climbing to a five year high and the benchmark year us treasury note reaching a four year high  presenting opportunities for increasing the bank s earning assets and generating higher levels of net interest income 
trading securities trading securities are securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price 
during the years ended december  and  the bank did not own any trading securities 
securities held to maturity securities held to maturity are debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at their aggregate cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
during the years ended december  and  the bank did not own any securities held to maturity 
management does not intend to utilize the held to maturity classification in the foreseeable future 
securities available for sale securities available for sale represented of total securities at december  and the designation of securities available for sale is made at the time of purchase  based upon management s intent to hold the securities for an indefinite time  however  these securities would be available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  related changes in the securities prepayment risk  needs for liquidity  or changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is managed on a total return basis with the objective of exceeding the return that would be experienced if investing solely in us treasury instruments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is used for liquidity purposes while simultaneously producing earnings 
investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings but shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are determined using the specific identification method and are shown separately in the statement of income 
the balances of securities available for sale are stated on the consolidated balance sheet net of fair value adjustments  reflecting net unrealized losses of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the change in net unrealized losses was principally attributed to changes in the securities portfolio composition and prevailing end of year market interest rates 
the unrealized loss positions at december  and also reflect the fact that a portion of the securities were purchased during periods of historically low interest rates and market yields  but do not give consideration to matched funding sources eg  borrowings acquired during those same periods of historically low interest rates which are not adjusted to current market value 
the following table summarizes the securities available for sale portfolio as of december  and december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value available for sale obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises us government agencies other obligations of state and political subdivisions total december  available for sale amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities obligations of u 
s 
government agencies obligations of government sponsored enterprises other obligations of state and political subdivisions total purchase premiums and discounts securities are typically purchased at premium or discounted prices  depending on the coupon of the security and prevailing interest rates 
the bank recognizes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts in interest income using the interest method over the estimated life of the security 
purchase premiums are amortized to the earliest call date  while purchase discounts are accreted to maturity 
premiums paid on mortgage backed securities are amortized proportionate to the three month trailing average constant payment rate cpr of each securitized pool of mortgages 
securities credit risk the bank evaluates and monitors the credit risk of its securities utilizing a variety of resources including external credit rating agencies  predominantly moody s and standard and poor s 
at december   moody s and or standard and poor s rated of the securities portfolio aaa 
the bank held no investment securities having a credit rating below aa as of december  securities interest income the total aggregate tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio amounted to in  compared with in  representing an increase of basis points 
the increase was principally attributed to the availability of higher market yields in compared with prior years 
in addition  most of the cash flows from the securities portfolio were reinvested into securities with higher market yields 
the total tax equivalent interest income from the securities portfolio amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in interest income from securities was attributed to the basis point increase in portfolio yield and the increase in the weighted average portfolio balance 
securities maturity distribution and weighted average yields the following tables summarize the maturity distribution of the amortized cost of the bank s securities portfolio and weighted average yields of such securities on a fully tax equivalent basis as of december  and the maturity distribution is based upon the final maturity date of the securities 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or pre pay certain securities 
in the case of mortgage backed securities  actual maturities may also differ from expected maturities due to the amortizing nature of the underlying mortgage collateral  and the fact that borrowers in most cases have the right to prepay 
securities maturity schedule and weighted average yields december  at fair value one year or less greater than one year to five years greater than five years to ten years greater than ten years obligations to us government sponsored enterprises weighted average yield mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises weighted average yield us government agencies weighted average yield other mortgage backed securities weighted average yield obligations of states of the us and political subdivisions weighted average yield total securities concentrations at december  and  the bank did not hold any securities for a single issuer  other than u 
s 
government agencies and sponsored enterprises  where the aggregate book value of the securities exceed of the company s shareholders equity 
management believes us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk  as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
at december  and  all securities issued by government agencies and sponsored enterprises were credit rated aaa by moody s and standard and poor s 
impaired securities the securities portfolio contains certain securities where amortized cost exceeds fair market value  which at december  amounted to an excess of  compared with  at december  unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded as a loss on the company s consolidated statements of income 
in evaluating whether impairment is other than temporary  management considers a variety of factors including the nature of the investment security  the cause of the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  and the bank s ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
other data considered by management includes  for example  sector credit ratings  volatility of the security s market price  and any other information considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred 
at december  and  management determined there were no unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio that were other than temporary 
the following table summarizes temporarily impaired securities and their approximate fair values at december  all securities referenced are debt securities 
at december   the bank did not hold any common stock or equity securities in its securities portfolio 
temporarily impaired securities december  less than months months or longer total description of securities fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses obligations to us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities us government sponsored enterprises us government agencies other mortgage backed securities obligations of states of the us and political subdivisions total temporarily impaired securities at december   the total unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities amounted to  representing of their amortized cost 
at december   no individual security had an unrealized loss greater than of its amortized cost 
total fair value of temporarily impaired securities having an unrealized loss of less than of their amortized cost amounted to  as of december   unrealized losses on securities in a continuous unrealized loss position more than twelve months amounted to  or of their amortized cost 
for securities with unrealized losses  the following information was considered in determining that the impairments were not other than temporary 
us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and therefore bear no credit risk 
securities backed by us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk  as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
other temporarily impaired securities are principally comprised of corporate mortgage backed securities  all with credit ratings of aaa 
at december   of the bank s temporarily impaired securities were credit rated aaa by standard and poor s and or moody s and there were none credit rated below aa 
management believes the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio at december  and were attributed to market interest rate increases  reflecting the volatile movements in the us treasury curve over the past several years 
specifically  certain debt securities were purchased in an interest rate environment lower than where the us treasury yield curve stood on december  and because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality or other factors  and because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these investment securities until a recovery of their amortized cost  which may be at maturity  the company does not consider these investment securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  and management believes the extent of unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities will steadily diminish over time as principal payments and pre payments are received and durations continue to shorten 
in the case of debt securities  management believes unrealized losses will diminish over time as maturity dates continue to shorten 
management also believes that any declines in the us treasury yield curve will further diminish the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio  as market values typically increase in a declining interest rate environment 
conversely  management believes that upward movements in the us treasury yield curve will increase the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio over the near term 
loans total loans at december   total loans amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
factors contributing to the changes in the loan portfolio are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis 
the loan portfolio is primarily secured by real estate in the counties of hancock  washington and knox  maine 
the following table summarizes the major components of the bank s loan portfolio  net of loan origination fees and costs  as of december over the past five years 
summary of loan portfolio at december real estate loans construction and development mortgage loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers commercial and industrial loans loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures all other loans real estate loans under foreclosure total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans construction and development loans construction and development loans are both consumer and commercial in nature and represented of total loans at december   compared with at december  total construction and development loans amounted to  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
construction and development loans generally migrate from construction status to completed projects with permanent financing arrangements within one year 
mortgage loans mortgage loans include all loans principally secured by real estate  including consumer real estate loans  home equity loans and commercial real estate loans 
mortgage loans accounted for of total loans at december   compared with at december  at december   total mortgage loans amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
commercial real estate loans accounted for over two thirds of this growth  with the balance attributed to consumer real estate and home equity loans 
loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers agricultural loans amounted to  at december  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
this category of loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  the communities served by the bank generally offer limited opportunities for lending in this industry sector 
commercial and industrial loans commercial and industrial loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  at december   commercial and industrial loans totaled  compared with  at the december   representing a decline of  or 
the decline was principally attributed to pay downs on certain commercial and industrial loan balances during the bank s market area demographics have historically limited the growth potential in this particular category of loans 
loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures personal consumer loans  including credit card loans and student loans  totaled  at december  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
this category of loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  given strong competition from the financing affiliates of consumer durable goods manufacturers  among other considerations  the bank has not campaigned aggressively for consumer installment loans over the past several years 
the bank continues to be one of relatively few community banks with its own credit card loan portfolio  as large credit card processing companies continue to acquire credit card portfolios and associated sources of non interest income from smaller financial institutions 
all other loans all other loans represented of the loan portfolio at december   compared with at december  the balance of all other loans at december  totaled  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
this category of loans principally includes loans to government municipalities and  to a lesser extent  not for profit organizations 
government municipality loans typically have short maturities and low interest rate risk characteristics 
government municipality loans are normally originated through a bid process among local financial institutions and are typically priced aggressively  thus generating narrow net interest income margins 
real estate loans under foreclosure at december   real estate loans under foreclosure totaled compared with at december   representing a decline of  or 
at december   real estate loans under foreclosure were represented by four consumer mortgage loans totaling and one commercial mortgage loan totaling at december   real estate loans under foreclosure were represented by four consumer mortgage loans amounting to and four commercial mortgage loan totaling during  foreclosure proceedings were completed or otherwise resolved on all eight of these loans  and any resulting charge offs were recognized 
loans secured by real estate at december   consumer and commercial real estate loans comprised of the loan portfolio  compared with at december  over the past few years the strength in the local real estate markets  both residential and commercial  led to historically high property values in the bank s market area 
however  during this trend began to soften 
recognizing the impact a softening real estate market may have on the loan portfolio and origination pipeline  the bank periodically reviews its underwriting standards in an effort to ensure that the quality of the loan portfolio is not jeopardized by excessive loan to value ratios or debt service levels 
there was no significant deterioration in the performance or risk characteristics of the real estate loan portfolio through the reporting period 
loan portfolio composition the following table summarizes the commercial  tax exempt and consumer components of the loan portfolio  together with the fixed and variable rate composition  as of december  and commercial loans real estate variable rate real estate fixed rate installment variable rate installment fixed rate lines of credit variable rate other variable and fixed rate deferred origination costs  net total commercial loans tax exempt variable rate fixed rate total tax exempt loans consumer real estate variable rate real estate fixed rate home equity variable rate home equity fixed rate installment variable rate installment fixed rate other variable and fixed rate deferred origination costs  net total consumer loans total loans allowance for loan losses loans  net of allowance for loan losses commercial loans contributed to loan growth  consumer loans contributed  followed by an increase of in tax exempt loans to municipalities

at december   total consumer loans  including consumer real estate loans  amounted to  representing an increase of  or  compared with december  residential real estate loans led consumer loan growth  posting an increase of  or compared with december  home equity loans posted a decline of  or  compared with december  the decline in home equity loans was principally attributed mortgage refinancing activity driven by the shape of the us treasury yield curve 
specifically  many borrowers migrated away from higher cost prime interest rate based home equity loans and consolidated their debt into lower cost fixed rate mortgages 
at december   total commercial loans amounted to  representing an increase of  or  compared with december  commercial loan growth was principally driven by commercial real estate loans  which posted an increase of  or 
bank management attributed the overall growth in commercial loans  in part  to an effective business banking team  a variety of new business development initiatives  focused incentive compensation plans and a relatively stable local economy 
loan concentrations at december   approximately  or of the loan portfolio was represented by loans to the lodging industry  compared with  or at december  loan concentrations continued to reflect the bank s business region 
other real estate owned when the bank takes ownership of collateral property upon foreclosure of a real estate secured loan  the property is transferred from the loan portfolio to other real estate owned oreo at its fair value 
if the loan balance is higher than the fair value of the property  the difference is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of the transfer 
oreo is classified on the consolidated balance sheet with other assets 
at december  there was no oreo  unchanged compared with december  mortgage loan servicing the bank from time to time will sell mortgage loans to other institutions  and investors 
the sale of loans allows the bank to make more funds available to customers in its servicing area  while the retention of servicing rights provides an additional source of income 
at december   the unpaid balance of mortgage loans serviced for others totaled  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
the decline in balances was attributed to serviced mortgage loan principal payments  as well as prepayments resulting from loan refinancing activity 
pursuant to the bank s asset and liability management strategy  its need for interest earning assets and its strong capital position  loans originated during and were held in the bank s loan portfolio 
loan maturities and re pricing distribution the following table summarizes fixed rate loans reported by remaining maturity  and floating rate loans by next re pricing date  as of december   and actual maturity dates may differ from contractual maturity dates due to prepayments or loan re financings 
maturities three months or less over three months through months over months through three years over three years though five years over five years through years over years total allowance for loan losses credit risk credit risk is managed through loan officer authorities  loan policies  and oversight from the bank s senior credit officer  the bank s senior loan officers committee  the directors loan committee  and the bank s board of directors 
management follows a policy of continually identifying  analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing independent review  subsequent to management s review  of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function  which reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
management recognizes that early and accurate recognition of risk is the best means to reduce credit losses and maximize earnings 
the bank employs a comprehensive risk management structure to identify and manage the risk of loss 
for consumer loans  the bank identifies loan delinquency beginning at day delinquency and provides appropriate follow up by written correspondence or personal contact 
non residential mortgage loan losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage loan losses are recognized during the foreclosure process  or sooner  when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the bank applies a risk grading system  which stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus appropriate efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are placed on non accrual status  either due to the delinquent status of principal and or interest  or a judgment by management that  although payments of principal and or interest are current  such action is prudent because collection in full of all outstanding principal and interest is in doubt 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal and or interest is days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and or interest payments are days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
non performing loans non performing loans include loans on non accrual status  loans that have been treated as troubled debt restructurings  and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest 
there were no troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio during and this continued to be the case during the following table sets forth the details of non performing loans over the last five years 
total non performing loans at december loans accounted for on a non accrual basis real estate loans construction and development residential mortgage loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers commercial and industrial loans loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more total non performing loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans non performing loans to total loans allowance to total loans during the year ended december   non performing loans remained at low levels 
the bank attributes this success  in part  to mature credit administration processes and underwriting standards  aided by a relatively stable local economy 
the bank maintains a centralized loan collection and managed asset department  providing timely and effective collection efforts for problem loans 
at december   total non performing loans amounted to compared with as of december   representing a decline of  or 
at december   non performing loans represented of total loans compared with at december  while the level of non performing loan ratios continued to reflect the favorable quality of the loan portfolio at december   bank management is cognizant of relatively softening economic conditions overall  and believes it is managing credit risk accordingly 
future levels of non performing loans may be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on the bank s customers  including higher interest rates and debt service levels  oil and gas prices  and other factors existing at the time 
management believes the economic activity and conditions in the local real estate markets will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the loan portfolio in future periods and  thus  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential problem loans in addition to the non performing loans discussed above  the bank also has loans that are to days delinquent 
these loans amounted to  and  at december  and  or and of total loans  respectively 
these loans and delinquency trends in general are considered in the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses and the related determination of the provision for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses allowance stood at  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
the allowance is available to absorb losses on loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance and provisioning for estimated losses is evaluated quarterly based on review of loans  with particular emphasis on non performing and other loans that management believes warrant special consideration 
the bank s board of directors reviews the evaluation of the allowance to ensure its adequacy 
the allowance is maintained at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of risk inherent in the current loan portfolio  and adequate to provide for estimated losses 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplemental reserves that adjust historical loss experience to reflect current economic conditions  industry specific risks  and other observable data 
loan loss provisions are recorded based upon overall aggregate data  and the allowance is increased when  on an aggregate basis  additional estimated losses are identified and deemed by management as being likely 
no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations could vary from current estimates 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table details changes in the allowance for loan losses and summarizes loan loss experience by loan type over the past five years

in this regard  of the net charge offs were attributed to one credit

at december  and  there were no impaired loans that did not have specific reserves 
the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december  and  and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent and were adequately reserved 
management reviews impaired loans to ensure such loans are transferred to interest non accrual status  and written down when necessary 
the amount of interest income not recorded on impaired loans amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general reserves account for the risk and estimated loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic loan concentrations within the loan portfolio 
there was no major change in loan concentrations during based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance for loan losses at december  to be appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and national economy as of that date 
funding sources the bank utilizes various traditional sources of funding to support its earning asset portfolios 
funding sources principally consist of retail deposits and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb of which it is a member  and certificates of deposit obtained from the national market 
historically  the banking business in the bank s market area has been seasonal  with lower deposits in the winter and spring and higher deposits in the summer and fall 
these seasonal swings have been fairly predictable and have not had a materially adverse impact on the bank 
seasonal swings in deposits have been typically absorbed by the bank s strong liquidity position  including borrowing lines from the fhlb and cash flows from the securities portfolio 
according to a january report prepared by the maine bureau of financial institutions  in through june  maine banks continued to book loans faster than core deposits  necessitating increased reliance on non core funding 
as a consequence  among maine banks  the loan to core deposit ratio rose to a record high of  well above the national average of and up from one year earlier 
during  the bank s average loan to core deposit ratio amounted to  compared with in according to the maine bureau of financial institutions  because core deposit growth has not kept pace with earning asset growth  maine banks have had to rely increasingly on borrowings and other types of non core funding  which supported of maine bank assets as of june   compared with the national average of 
during the bank s non core funding averaged of total average assets  compared with in management believes that the bank s future success in growing core funding will be a determinant factor in its ability to grow earning assets and leverage its strong capital position 
deposits during  the most significant source of funding for the bank s earning assets continued to be retail deposits  gathered throughout its network of twelve banking offices throughout downeast and midcoast maine 
total average retail deposits accounted for of the funding required in supporting the bank s earning asset portfolios during  compared with in total deposits at december  total deposits amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
deposit growth in was supplemented with  in certificates of deposit obtained from the national market brokered deposits  as the bank s earning asset growth outpaced retail deposit growth 
at december   total retail deposits amounted to  representing an increase of  or compared with december  money market accounts led the overall growth in retail deposits  which was principally attributed to the introduction of a new variable rate money market account in early management believes that competition from banks and non banks intensified during  as savers and investors sought higher returns in an atmosphere of rising short term interest rates  and that financial institutions in particular have been aggressive in pricing their deposits in order to fund earning asset growth 
since short term rates began rising in june  management believes it has exercised restraint with respect to overly aggressive deposit pricing strategies  and has sought to achieve an appropriate balance between retail deposit growth and wholesale funding levels  while protecting the bank s net interest margin and liquidity position 
total average deposits amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
total average retail deposits amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or

total average demand deposits amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
demand deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in the rate of demand deposit growth lagged historical norms during management attributes this  in part  to a lower level of seasonal deposits compared with historical norms  and believes this was consistent with a reportedly softer tourist season in the market areas served by the bank 
management also believes that competition for demand deposits intensified during  with more financial institutions offering no fee checking accounts  combined with other promotional activities 
the bank strives to attract demand deposits in connection with its commercial lending activities  on a total relationship basis 
the bank s business checking account offerings include small businessplus  businessplus  and free small business  each designed to help business owners manage the varying financial aspects of their business 
the bank also offers its business customers a variety of cash management products including a cash management sweep account 
customers are able to automatically transfer their excess demand deposit balances  over certain thresholds established with an earnings credit rate  to interest bearing  overnight securities repurchase agreements 
business demand deposits are also generated by way of the bank s merchant credit card processing program 
now account deposits the bank offers now accounts to individuals  not for profit organizations and sole proprietor businesses 
at december   total now accounts stood at  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
during total average now accounts amounted to  compared with  in  representing a decline of  or 
now accounts represented of total average deposits during  compared with in bank management attributed the decline in now account balances to the interest rate environment and an atmosphere of well publicized and more attractive short term interest rates provided by alternative deposit products  such as the bank s high yielding money market account 
during  the bank s most successful now account product continued to be gold wave checking  a relationship product designed for its age and above customers 
savings and money market deposits at december   total savings and money market accounts amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total average savings and money market accounts amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
savings and money market accounts represented of total average deposits during  compared with in in response to competitive pricing pressures and continuing market demand  in early the bank introduced its new prime based horizon money market account  which management believes was highly competitive and designed to satisfy the needs of both small and large investors alike 
the growth in savings and money market accounts was principally attributed to this new product 
the bank offers statement savings accounts  and as a community oriented financial institution  continues to support the more traditional passbook savings accounts 
time deposits at december   total time deposits stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total average time deposits amounted to  in compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
time deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in in pricing time deposits  particularly non relationship time deposits  the bank will consider other sources of funding which may be offered at more attractive terms and prices  including borrowed funds and time deposits available in the national market 
bank management attributes the growth in time deposits to its competitive pricing strategies and customer retention programs 
additionally  given the increase in short term interest rates and the flattening us treasury curve  investors and savers appeared attracted to higher yielding certificates of deposit with relatively short term maturities 
time deposits in denominations of or greater totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of or greater maturity schedule time deposits thousand or greater december  maturity three months or less over three months to six months over six to twelve months over twelve months brokered time deposits at december   total brokered time deposits stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total average brokered time deposits amounted to  during compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
brokered time deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in the increase in brokered time deposits was primarily attributed to the funding needs associated with the bank s strong earning asset growth  principally loans  which outpaced retail deposit growth during the rates of interest paid on brokered time deposits were generally comparable with collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank  the primary source of wholesale funding used by the bank 
borrowed funds borrowed funds principally consist of advances from the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
advances from the fhlb are secured by stock in the fhlb  investment securities  and blanket liens on qualifying mortgage loans and home equity loans 
the bank utilizes borrowed funds in leveraging its strong capital position and supporting its earning asset portfolios 
borrowed funds are principally utilized to support the bank s investment securities portfolio and  to a lesser extent  fund loan growth 
borrowed funds also provide a means to help manage balance sheet interest rate risk  given the bank s ability to select desired amounts  terms and maturities on a daily basis 
borrowings from the federal home loan bank at december   borrowings from the fhlb totaled  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
during  borrowings from the fhlb averaged  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in borrowings from the fhlb was utilized to fund earning asset growth  which outpaced the growth in retail deposits 
total average borrowings from the fhlb expressed as a percentage of total average assets amounted to during  compared with in securities sold under agreements to repurchase at december   securities sold under repurchase agreements amounted to  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
securities sold under repurchase agreements were collateralized by us government sponsored agency obligations  held in safekeeping by nonaffiliated financial institutions 
borrowing maturities borrowing maturities are managed in concert with the bank s asset and liability management strategy  and are closely aligned with the ongoing management of balance sheet interest rate risk 
as of december   total short term borrowings  including securities sold under repurchase agreements  amounted to  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
conversely  long term borrowings at december  totaled  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
in prior years  the bank had utilized higher cost  longer term borrowings to manage the interest rate risk associated with the growth in longer term  fixed rate  earning assets generated during periods of historically low interest rates 
while this strategy pressured net interest income in the near term  management believes it lessened the degree of interest rate risk and better positioned the bank for rising interest rates  similar to the interest rate environment experienced during capital resources consistent with its long term goal of operating a sound and profitable organization  during the company maintained its strong capital position and continued to be a well capitalized financial institution according to applicable regulatory standards 
management believes this to be vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a solid foundation for future growth 
historically  most of the company s capital requirements have been provided through retained earnings and this continued to be the case during the year ended december  stock repurchase plans in november  the company announced a stock repurchase plan 
the board of directors of the company at that time authorized open market and privately negotiated purchases of up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or  shares 
as of the date of termination of this plan on december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under the plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company recorded the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
in march  the company announced a second stock repurchase plan 
the board of directors of the company authorized open market and privately negotiated purchases of up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or  shares 
purchases began on march  and were continued through december  the company s board of directors subsequently authorized the continuance of this program through december  depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under this plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company recorded the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
the company believes that a stock repurchase plan is a prudent use of its capital at this time 
management anticipates the stock repurchase plan will be accretive to the return on average shareholders equity and earnings per share 
management also believes that the stock repurchase plan helps facilitate an orderly market for the disposition of large blocks of stock  and lessens the price volatility associated with the company s thinly traded stock 
cash dividends the company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
each quarter the board of directors declares the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends  subject to adjustment from time to time  based on the company s earnings outlook  the strength of the balance sheet  its need for funds  and other relevant factors 
there can be no assurance that dividends on the company s common stock will be paid in the future 
the company s principal source of funds to pay cash dividends and support its commitments is derived from bank operations 
during  the company declared and distributed cash dividends in the aggregate amount of  compared with  in the company s dividend payout ratio amounted to  compared with in the total dividends paid in amounted to per common share of stock  compared with in  representing an increase of  or 
in the first quarter of  the company increased its quarterly cash dividend by to per common share  representing an increase of or compared with the dividend paid for the same quarter in the dividend will be paid march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  capital ratios the company and the bank are subject to the risk based capital guidelines administered by the company s and the bank s principal regulators 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under these guidelines  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of  including a minimum ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets of and a tier i capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
as of december  and  the company and the bank were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a minimum tier i capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of at least 
at december   the company s total risk based capital was  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  at december   the company s tier i capital totaled  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  the ratio of tier i capital to average assets  or leverage ratio  at december  was  compared with at december  the following table sets forth the company s regulatory capital at december  and  under the rules applicable at that date 
december  december  amount ratio amount ratio total capital to risk weighted assets regulatory requirement excess tier capital to risk weighted assets regulatory requirement excess tier capital to average assets regulatory requirement excess as more fully disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  the bank also maintained its standing as a well capitalized institution as defined by applicable regulatory standards 
at december   the bank s tier i leverage  tier i risk based and total risk based capital ratios stood at  and  respectively 
there are no known trends  events or uncertainties  nor any recommendations by any regulatory authority  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s capital resources  liquidity  or financial condition 
contractual obligations the company is a party to certain contractual obligations under which it is obligated to make future payments 
these principally include borrowings from the fhlb  consisting of short and long term fixed rate borrowings  and collateralized by all stock in the fhlb  a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first and second mortgages secured by one to four family properties  and certain pledged investment securities 
the company has an obligation to repay all borrowings from the fhlb 
the company is also obligated to make payments on operating leases for its branch office in somesville and its office in bangor  maine 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  borrowings are stated at their contractual maturity due dates and do not reflect call features  or principal amortization features  on certain borrowings 
contractual obligations payments due by period description total amount of obligations year years years years operating leases borrowings from federal home loan bank securities sold under agreements to repurchase total in the normal course of its banking and financial services business  and in connection with providing products and services to its customers  the company has entered into a variety of traditional third party contracts for support services 
examples of such contractual agreements would include services providing atm  visa debit and credit card processing  trust services accounting support  student loan servicing  check printing  and the leasing of t telecommunication lines supporting the company s wide area technology network 
the majority of the company s core operating systems and software applications are maintained in house with traditional third party maintenance agreements of one year or less 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is  from time to time  a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  that may be material to investors 
at december  and  the company s off balance sheet arrangements were limited to standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit the bank guarantees the obligations or performance of certain customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit products 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon issuance of a standby letter of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the customer 
at december   commitments under existing standby letters of credit totaled  compared with at december  the fair value of the standby letters of credit was not significant as of the foregoing dates 
off balance sheet risk the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain financial derivative instruments  namely  interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit represent agreements by the bank to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis using the same credit policies as it does for its balance sheet instruments  such as loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon the issuance of commitment  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
the following table summarizes the bank s commitments to extend credit as of december commitments to extend credit december  december  commitments to originate loans unused lines of credit un advanced portions of construction loans total financial derivative instruments as part of its overall asset and liability management strategy  the bank periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income 
derivative instruments that management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
a policy statement  approved by the board of directors of the bank  governs use of derivative instruments 
at december   the bank had four outstanding derivative instruments with notional amounts totaling  the notional amounts of the financial derivative instruments do not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank is exposed to credit loss only to the extent the counter party defaults in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the agreements 
management does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties to the agreements  and regularly reviews the credit quality of the counter parties from which the instruments have been purchased 
the details of the bank s financial derivative instruments as of december  are summarized as follows 
the reader should also refer to note of the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item in this report on form k 
interest rate swap agreements description maturity notional amount in thousands fixed interest rate variable interest rate receive fixed rate  pay variable rate prime receive fixed rate  pay variable rate prime the bank is required to pay a counter party monthly variable rate payments indexed to prime  while receiving fixed rate payments based upon interest rates of and  respectively  over the term of each respective agreement 
the following table summarizes the contractual cash flows of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   based upon the then current prime interest rate of payments due by period total less than year years fixed payments due from counter party variable payments due to counter party based on prime rate net cash flow total net cash flows paid to counter parties amounted to in  compared with total net cash flows received from counter parties of and in and  respectively 
the changes in net cash flows paid to and received from counter parties were attributed to increases in the prime interest rate during and interest rate floor agreements notional amount termination date prime strike rate premium paid in  interest rate floor agreements were purchased by the bank to limit its exposure to falling interest rates on two pools of loans indexed to the prime interest rate 
under the terms of the agreements the bank paid premiums of and for the right to receive cash flow payments if the prime interest rate falls below the predetermined floor rates of and  thus effectively ensuring interest income on the pools of prime based loans at minimum rates of and on the  and  notional amounts for the duration of the agreements  respectively 
the interest rate floor agreements were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas liquidity liquidity is measured by the company s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss 
the company seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands 
besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations  liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served by its network of offices  its mix of assets and liabilities  reputation and credit standing in the marketplace  and general economic conditions 
the bank actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under its asset liability management policy approved by the bank s board of directors 
continual monitoring of these ratios  both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios  allows the bank to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank uses a basic surplus model to measure its liquidity over and day time horizons 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement are routinely monitored 
the bank s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at approximately of total assets 
at december   liquidity  as measured by the basic surplus model  was over the day horizon and over the day horizon 
a portion of the bank s deposit base has been historically seasonal in nature  with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring  during which period the bank s liquidity position tightens 
at december   the bank had unused lines of credit and net unencumbered qualifying collateral availability to support its credit line with the fhlb approximating million 
the bank also had capacity to borrow funds on a secured basis utilizing certain un pledged securities in its securities portfolio 
the bank s loan portfolio provides an additional source of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through pledging or sales 
however  there were no loans held for sale at december  the bank also has access to the national brokered deposit market  and has been using this funding source to bolster its liquidity position 
the bank maintains a liquidity contingency plan approved by the bank s board of directors 
this plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis  and identifies other sources of liquidity available to the company 
the company believes that the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements 
however  changes in economic conditions  including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on the company s liquidity position 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates and the us treasury yield curve may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
while the financial nature of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  inflation does affect the company because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation

net interest income net interest income is the principal component of the company s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is entirely generated by the bank 
fluctuations in market interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
total net interest income for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decline of or and an increase of  or  respectively 
the decline in net interest income was principally attributed to a basis point decline in the net interest margin  which in amounted to compared with in as is widely the situation throughout the banking industry  the decline in the net interest margin was largely attributed to the seventeen consecutive increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve bank from june to june and a flat to inverted yield curve throughout  the impact of which has caused the bank s funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield on its earning asset portfolios 
the increase in net interest income was principally attributed to a  or increase in average earning assets during the year  aided by a relatively unchanged net interest margin  which in amounted to compared with in factors contributing to the changes in net interest income and the net interest margin are further enumerated in the following discussion and analysis

net interest margin the net interest margin  expressed on a tax equivalent basis  represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and interest paid to depositors and other creditors  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
the net interest margin is determined by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the average tax equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is generally higher than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity 
the company s net interest margin amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing declines of and basis points  respectively

in june of  following an extended period of historically low interest rates  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve began increasing short term interest rates 
through june of  the fed funds targeted rate had been increased seventeen times for a total of basis points  ending at 
however  during this same period of time  the benchmark year us treasury note increased only basis points  causing a dramatic basis point flattening of the us treasury yield curve the yield curve 
the yield curve remained flat to inverted throughout in the first quarter of the bank s net interest margin began to decline and this decline steadily continued through the fourth quarter of the declining net interest margin was principally attributed to the increases in the bank s cost of funds outpacing the increases in yields on its interest earning assets  reflecting the re pricing of a large portion of the bank s funding base during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  combined with highly competitive pricing pressures with respect to loans and deposits  a higher utilization of wholesale funding  and the inherent net interest margin challenges widely associated with a flat or inverted us treasury yield curve 
the yield on average earning assets amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing increases of and basis points  respectively 
however  the cost of interest bearing liabilities amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing increases of and basis points  respectively 
in short  during and  the increases in the cost of the bank s interest bearing liabilities exceeded the increases in yields on its earning asset portfolios by and basis points  respectively 
should short term interest rates continue at current levels with a yield curve that is inverted or flat  management anticipates continued pressure on the net interest margin during  but not to the same degree experienced in specifically  management does not anticipate further declines of the magnitude experienced in in an unchanged interest rate environment 
bank management believes that continued balance sheet growth will be needed to meaningfully increase the level of net interest income in  should interest rates remain at current levels and the yield curve remain flat to inverted 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity position is more fully described in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the increase in interest income was attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average earning asset yield 
the increase in interest income was attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average earning asset yield 
in and  the increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve favorably impacted the yields on the bank s variable rate loan portfolios 
in addition  cash flows from the bank s fixed rate earning asset portfolios were generally reinvested in higher yielding earning assets

the income from tax exempt assets has been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  thereby allowing uniform comparisons to be made 
because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the periods analyzed  it is not possible to precisely allocate changes to volume or rate 
for presentation purposes  changes which are not solely due to volume changes or rate changes have been allocated to these categories in proportion to the relationships of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses reflects the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of inherent risk of loss in the bank s current loan portfolio 
the bank s non performing loans remained at low levels during at december   total non performing loans amounted to  or of total loans  compared with or at december  the allowance expressed as a percentage of non performing loans amounted to at december   compared with at december the bank s loan loss experience also remained at low levels during in  net loan charge offs amounted to  or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of  compared with or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of in loan charge offs during were principally attributed to one credit amounting to for the year ended december   the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared with no provision in and a provision of in the increase in the provision for loan losses compared with principally reflected growth in the bank s loan portfolio

non interest income in addition to net interest income  non interest income is a significant source of revenue for the company and an important factor in its results of operations 
for the year ended december   total non interest income amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
factors contributing to the changes in non interest income are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis trust and financial services income income from trust and financial services represented of the company s total non interest income in  compared with and in and  respectively 
income from trust and financial services is principally derived from fee income based on a percentage of the market value of client assets under management and held in custody and  to a lesser extent  revenue from brokerage services conducted through bar harbor financial services  an independent third party broker 
for the year ended december   income generated from trust and financial services amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing increases of and  or and  respectively 
the increases in and fee income were driven by trust and investment services  as revenue generated from third party brokerage activities at bar harbor financial services posted moderate declines  reflecting lower trading volumes  including sales of mutual funds and annuity products 
during this period  the company placed less emphasis on third party brokerage activities and reduced the associated operating overhead 
the and increases in revenue from trust and financial services were principally attributed to the growth of the managed assets portfolio 
at december   total managed assets at bar harbor trust services stood at  compared with  and  at december  and  representing increases of  and  or and  respectively 
in light of the growth in the managed assets portfolio  management believes the portfolio is positioned to generate higher levels of fee income in service charges on deposit accounts this income is principally derived from monthly deposit account maintenance and activity fees  overdraft fees  and a variety of other deposit account related fees 
income from service charges on deposit accounts represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from service charges on deposit accounts amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
the increase in service charges on deposits was attributed  in part  to the introduction of a new overdraft protection service  which was launched by the bank in the latter part of the increase also reflected the continued growth of the bank s retail  non maturity deposit base 
bank management attributed the decline in service charges on deposit accounts  in part  to aggressive competitive pricing in the markets served by the bank  with financial institutions competing for deposit market share and offering a variety of no fee products 
management also believed that the decline reflected a change in customer preferences  with many small balance accounts being consolidated and migrated to relationship products having lower maintenance and service fees 
credit card service charges and fees this income is principally derived from the bank s merchant credit card transaction processing services and  to a lesser extent  fees associated with its visa credit card product 
historically  the bank s merchant credit card activities have been seasonal in nature with transaction volumes peaking in summer and autumn  while declining in winter and spring 
income from credit card service charges and fees represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from credit card service charges and fees amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decline of or and an increase of  or  respectively 
the decline in credit card service charges and fees were principally attributed to lower merchant credit card processing volumes 
the lower volumes were attributed  in part  to the partial relocation of the bank s largest merchant credit card client  combined with intensifying competition from large regional processors 
the declines in merchant credit card processing revenue were more than offset by declines in merchant credit card processing expense  which is included in non interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
while merchant credit card processing profit margins have generally tightened over the past few years  with competition from large regional processors intensifying  the bank has been able to sustain a meaningful revenue stream through new business  increased volumes of transactions  competitive pricing strategies  and the local support offered by a community bank 
net securities gains this source of non interest income is derived from net realized gains on the sale of securities 
realized gains on the sale of investment securities represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net realized gains on the sale of securities amounted to  compared with and in and  representing increases of and or and  respectively 
there is no assurance that the recording of realized securities gains will continue in future reporting periods at  and levels 
it is important to note  however  that the available for sale securities portfolio is managed on a total return basis  in concert with well structured asset and liability management policies 
bank management will continue to respond to changes in market interest rates  changes in securities pre payment or extension risk  changes in the availability of and yields on alternative investments  and the bank s need for adequate liquidity 
net income on interest rate swap agreements as part of its overall asset liability management strategy  the bank periodically uses interest rate swap agreements to minimize significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
at december   and  the bank had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts totaling  during the first quarter of  the bank de designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges and  from the time of de designation  changes in their fair value and current period net cash flows representing net amounts received from or paid to counter parties were recorded in the consolidated statement of income and included as part of non interest income 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance regarding sfas no 
implementation issue no 
g  cash flow hedges using the first payments received technique in hedging the variable interest payments on a group of non benchmark rate based loans  in which the fasb indicated the first payments received technique for identifying the hedged forecasted transactions that is  the hedged interest payments can be used in a cash flow hedge of the variable prime rate based or other variable non benchmark rate based interest payments for a rolling portfolio of pre payable interest bearing loans  provided all other conditions for a cash flow hedge have been met 
during the third quarter of the bank designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges and  prospectively from the time of this designation  changes in their fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  while current period net cash flows representing net amounts received from or paid to counter parties are recorded as interest income 
for the year ended december   non interest income on interest rate swap agreements amounted to non hedge accounting period  whereas no such non interest income was recorded in and hedge accounting periods 
of the in non interest income on interest rate swap agreements recorded in  represented net cash flows received from counter parties  and represented net unrealized gains 
the bank s interest rate swap agreements are discussed in further detail under part ii
