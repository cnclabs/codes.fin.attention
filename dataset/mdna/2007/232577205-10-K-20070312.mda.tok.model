as of december   we had sold more than  aesthetic treatment systems worldwide 
we were incorporated in july in  el 
en 
spa  an italian company that itself and through subsidiaries develops and markets laser systems for medical and industrial applications  acquired a majority of our capital stock 
in september  we recruited a new management team that has implemented a comprehensive reorganization of our company  including redesigning many of our existing products  introducing innovative new products and technologies  streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing processes  reorganizing and expanding our research and development  sales and marketing and distribution capabilities  and enhancing our customer service network

we began shipping these redesigned products in the second quarter of we believe that this new approach allows our platform technology to be easily upgradeable  increases the scalability and efficiency of our production process and facilitates improvements in field service diagnosis and repair 
we expect that the new modular design of these products will reduce our direct labor and inventory costs and result in lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
on august   we acquired the remaining minority interest in suzhou cynosure medical devices company  ltd 
s  which we refer to as suzhou  outstanding common stock for a purchase price of  in cash 
we acquired the minority interest to gain complete control over suzhou while extending the business license of suzhou 
the purchase of the minority interest was contingent upon chinese government approval of the shareholder transfer from the seller to us for the shares acquired and approval of extension of the business license of suzhou for a period of years 
the existing business license was set to expire on october  on november   suzhou received approval from the chinese government  evidenced by the issuance of a new business license allowing operations in china until october  the aggregate purchase price of  was allocated to fair value of the minority interest in suzhou  valued at approximately  as of august   with the residual of  allocated to the business license  which is subject to amortization due to its limited useful life

in october  we entered into a preferred vendor agreement with sona medspa whereby we sold certain of these systems to sona for approximately million which we recorded as deferred revenue in as the fee was not deemed to be fixed or determinable at the time of sale 
in march  sona medspa notified us that it was uncertain that it had the financial resources to honor its commitments to us and we determined that the collectibility of the fee was not probable and  as a result  reversed the related deferred revenue 
we expensed as cost of goods sold approximately  of inventory delivered under the agreement 
additionally  we provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of  for accounts receivable associated with services provided prior to the october preferred vendor agreement

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we are party to a revenue sharing arrangement with an operator and franchisor of spa franchises and recognize revenue from this arrangement in the period in which the procedures are performed 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s fair value in accordance with the principles of emerging issues task force issue number  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectibility issues and our historical experience with losses 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we may not continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past  which could cause our provisions for doubtful accounts to increase 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk 

table of contents inventories and allowance for obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  and was million 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
product warranty costs and provisions we provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
the modified prospective transition method is one in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in addition  sfas r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas as a result  we have applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of in determining the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
effective with the adoption of sfas r  we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options  rather than a binomial model 
the weighted average fair values of the options granted during the year ended december  were using the following assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected lives years expected volatility option pricing models require the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
due to our initial public offering in december  we believe there is not adequate information on the volatility of our own shares 
as such  we estimated expected 
table of contents stock price volatility is based on an average of the volatility of other similar companies in the same industry 
we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry 
our expected term of options granted in the year ended december  was derived from the short cut method described in sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
sfas r is a new and very complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives  and expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
there is little experience or guidance available with respect to developing these assumptions and models 
in addition  given our initial public offering in december  we have a very limited data in terms of historical forfeiture rates  volatilities and expected terms as a public company and  as such  we are developing our estimates for our volatilities and expected terms based on guideline companies within our industry 
if actual forfeiture rates  volatilities and expected terms differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated stock based compensation expense in future periods 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf issue no 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and  as such  we do not provide us income tax on such undistributed earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes  or fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
based on our evaluation as of december   we do not believe that fin will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively as of january   with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of state and municipal government obligations  corporate obligations and certificates of deposit 
each security matures by july  these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity excluding acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  investments at fair value weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
a significant portion of our operations is conducted through operations in countries other than the united states 
revenues from our international operations that were recorded in us dollars represented approximately of our total international revenues during the year ended december  substantially all of the remainder of our revenues was from sales in euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
since we conduct our business in us dollars  our main exposure  if any  results from changes in the exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked 
therefore  we believe that the potential loss that would result from an increase or decrease in the exchange rate is immaterial to our business and net assets
