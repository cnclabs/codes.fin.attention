item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
our net income was million  an increase of over the increase in net income was due to strategic decisions implemented by management over the past few years  the bank s ability to increase its net interest margin  a focus on controlling our operating costs and a reduction in the effective tax rate 
proved to be a challenging year with an inverted interest rate yield curve  a slowed economy and intense competition for retail and commercial deposits 
operations in were impacted by the following factors and strategic initiatives slow loan and deposit growth impact on net interest margin loan growth slowed significantly in as compared to  resulting in a minimal net increase in the loan portfolio of million 
commercial loan production remained at a consistent level with but was offset by the increased payback of commercial development loans 
residential mortgage loan growth was tempered by management during as a result of strong customer preference for fixed rate loans 
the bank utilized the secondary market as an outlet for this type of lending to prevent excessive growth in the fixed rate portfolio 
management s preference for originating adjustable  prime rate based loans has benefited us in the current rising interest rate environment 
although we experienced minimal increase in loan growth  interest income exceeded interest income generated in prior years due to the upward re pricing of loans 
for  interest income on loans increased million on a fully taxable equivalent basis when compared with interest income on investment securities in increased by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to an increase in the average yield on the portfolio and a million leverage strategy 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table below 
funding costs in increased as a result of the rising interest rate environment and the intense deposit competition in our market areas 
the shift from core non interest bearing accounts to certificates of deposit and higher yielding money market accounts continued during a large portion of the new time deposits received in were in denominations of  or more  which typically require higher interest rates than core deposits 
this reliance on higher rate time deposits and the general increase in interest rates throughout increased deposit interest expense by approximately million when compared to net borrowings increased by million adding an additional million of interest expense over the prior year 
the combination of slow loan and deposit growth  rising interest rates on our assets and liabilities  and the increased level of debt resulted in a minimal increase in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in when compared to the overall net interest margin increased during the year from in to in however  the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a million leverage strategy implemented in the latter half of in an attempt to produce additional net interest income 
early redemption of long term borrowings in may  the bank participated in a contemporaneous exchange of long term fhlb advances 
the bank exchanged million of long term advances having a weighted average rate of for million of long term advances having a weighted average rate of 
the exchange resulted in a net gain of 
million which will be amortized over the life of the new borrowing 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income in decreased slightly when compared to the bank experienced increases in service charge and trust department income of 
million and 
million  respectively 
insurance commissions were down slightly in compared to due to lower contingency income from insurance companies and the closing of oakfirst life insurance  inc early in other income in included a 
million gain on the prepayment of long term debt 
operating expenses in increased by when compared to this minimal increase was due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits  occupancy and other expenses and close monitoring of our operating expenses 
operating expenses included a 
million penalty recognized on the prepayment of long term debt 
the bank continued to invest in its core market areas during a new branch office was opened during the fourth quarter of in morgantown  west virginia and construction of another branch began on a newly leased site in washington county  maryland 
this new retail branch is anticipated to open late in the first quarter of the corporation purchased a  square foot building in oakland  maryland in december for million to house its operations center 
this space will relieve congestion in the corporation s headquarters as well as provide capacity for the bank s anticipated growth 
management expects that this new facility will be ready for use in the first quarter of the corporation continued its tradition of paying dividends to shareholders during and  in fact  increased them to per share  a increase from per share in the corporation has paid quarterly cash dividends consistently since  the year in which it was formed 
we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products by existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  changes in interest rates  and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with the specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in this item under the caption allowance and provision for loan losses and in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have million of core deposit intangible assets which are subject to amortization and million in goodwill primarily related to the huntington national bank branch acquisition that occurred in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
management has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as a result of the evaluation 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities management systematically evaluates investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
r and as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for deferred benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  part ii of this annual report discusses new accounting pronouncements that when adopted  may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income increased million in over the same period in  due to an million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to this increase is attributable to the growth that we experienced in our investment portfolio late in and throughout emphasis on adjustable rate loan products and the rising interest rate environment contributed to the increase in the average rate on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
interest expense increased during when compared to due to the higher interest rate environment  and an overall increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
deposits have increased in by approximately million due to an increase in brokered certificates of deposit and a successful retail promotion of a nine month certificate of deposit 
the combined effect of the increasing rate environment and the volume increases in our average interest bearing liabilities resulted in an basis point increase in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for to for the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point increase in the net interest margin at december  to from at december  comparing to  net interest income increased million due primarily to the increase in interest income of million  offset by an increase in interest expense of million 
interest income from loans increased by million due to the million increase in the average balance of loans in and a slight increase of basis points in the average yield on loans 
the increase in total interest expense was due to increased interest expense on deposits of million offset by a decrease in interest expense on long term borrowings of million 
interest expense on deposits increased primarily due to a million increase in average balances and a basis point increase in the average yield on time deposits over  the decrease in interest expense on long term borrowings was primarily due to the million decrease in the average balance coupled with the basis point decrease in average yield on these borrowings 
as shown below  the composition of total interest income remained steady from to loan interest income and fees decreased in when compared to as a percentage of total interest income due to the limited loan growth and the increase in investment securities as a percentage of interest earning assets during this time

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in increased by 
million over  due primarily to an increase in the level of non accrual loans and changes in the qualitative factors used in the quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these changes were offset by a decrease in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to 
in from 
in and minimal loan growth in the provision for loan losses decreased to million in  compared to million in this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to 
in from 
in and a decrease in specific allocations as compared to other operating income the following table shows the major components of other operating income for the past three years in thousands and the percentage changes during these years vs

service charge related income constitutes   and of other operating income in   and  respectively 
trust department income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets  and by the amount of assets under management 
trust income has increased steadily during the past three years as a result of successful business development efforts in this area  resulting in increases in the average market value of assets under management in the trust department 
average assets under management were million  million and million for years  and  respectively 
brokerage commissions have steadily declined over the past three years 
less emphasis on this type of business and slower annuity sales have contributed to this decline 
insurance premium income also declined slightly in due to the closing of the corporation s reinsurance company  oakfirst life insurance  inc  in and lower contingency income 
contingency income is received from the insurance carriers based upon claims histories and varies from year to year 
first united insurance group purchased a book of business in morgantown  wv during the latter half of because premium payment schedules are more heavily weighted in the first six months of the year  management expects to realize the full benefit of this purchase in securities gains losses are the most variable component of other operating income 
during  the bank recorded a minimal gain in the securities portfolio compared to the recorded losses in the securities portfolio of

the higher increase in over was attributable to increases in performance based incentives resulting from high loan and deposit growth 
other expenses increased by 
million in when compared to due to increases in marketing  insurance  and contribution expenses 
we experienced cost savings in associated with corporate restructurings that occurred during comparing to  other expenses decreased by 
million due to reduced professional fees associated with various compliance costs in  such as the sarbanes oxley act 
there were no expenses related to prepayment of long term borrowings in expenses related to early redemption of long term borrowings consisted of 
million and million in early payment penalties in and  respectively  and a

the decrease in the effective tax rate for reflects the effects of management s efforts during late and early to restructure the composition of the investment portfolio to include more tax exempt municipal securities 
the increase in the effective tax rate in over was due primarily to corporate restructurings in february and may consolidated balance sheet review overview our total assets reached billion at december   representing an increase of million from year end the year end total interest earning asset mix shows a consistent percentage of loans as a percentage of total assets over the past three years  as illustrated below year end percentage of total assets net loans investments the year end total liability mix shows greater reliance on deposits as a source of funding during the three year period and reduced reliance on borrowings  as illustrated below year end percentage of total liabilities total deposits total borrowings loan portfolio through the bank and the oakfirst loan centers  we are actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington  and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley  monongalia counties in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate  and to a lesser extent  by equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for all of the periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio dollars in thousands table loans outstanding as of december commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment real estate construction lease financing total loans during  gross loans increased by million  or 
over this growth was focused in our commercial million and residential mortgage million loan portfolios  offset by a decline in installment million and residential construction million loan portfolios  and remains consistent with management s objectives over the past several years 
continued efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at year end  adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at year end commercial loans increased in  following an increase in origination of new commercial loans remained high in  similar to  as our lenders continued to identify new customer opportunities and expand existing customer relationships in all of our market areas  while maintaining existing standards of credit worthiness 
however  during both and  new loan volume was offset by high levels of repayment  which stifled growth as compared to prior years 
most new commercial loans were priced on a variable rate basis  resetting monthly  which proved to be very popular with business borrowers 
commercial loans secured by real estate were of total commercial loans at the end of  compared to in and in residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  in when compared to this follows a increase in over growth in the mortgage loan portfolio during was primarily in fixed rate mortgages due to the flat interest rate yield curve 
this loan product was utilized to satisfy the requirements of the community reinvestment act 
actual residential mortgage growth in of million over was offset by million in loan sales during the fourth quarter of the loans selected for sale were identified through an extensive analysis of the mortgage portfolio and included primarily adjustable rate products that management believed presented limited opportunities for improved yields in the next few years 
proceeds from the loan sale were invested in the bank s investment portfolio  primarily in higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities 
fixed interest rate loans make up of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to of total loans at the end of and at the end of consumer installment loans in decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s continued shift toward more commercial loans with less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market 
specifically  less focus was placed on generating new indirect auto loans during and indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at the end of  and and at the end of and  respectively 
the remaining lease financing portfolio was repaid in and we discontinued this line of business 
the following table sets forth remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  in thousands maturities of loan portfolio at december  table maturing within one year after one but within five years maturing after five years total commercial real estate mortgage installment real estate construction total loans classified by sensitivity to change in interest rates fixed interest rate loans adjustable interest rate loans total loans it is our policy to place a loan in non accrual status  except for consumer loans  whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors the status of all non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due 
table sets forth the historical amounts of non accrual  past due and restructured loans in thousands for the past five years risk elements of loan portfolio table at december non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans interest income not recognized as a result of placing loans on a non accrual status was

allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
we use the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non accrual loans  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at year end  from million at year end several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a increase in the balance of non accrual loans from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reveiewed quarterly  offset by a decrease in impaired loans from 
million in to 
million in  and a decrease in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
to  due to a decline in the amount of commercial and installment loan charge offs during at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was six times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses decreased to million at year end  from million at year end several factors contributed to the 
million decrease in the balance of the allowance in  including a decrease in the balance of non accrued loans from million in to million in  a decrease in impaired loans from 
million in to 
million in  and a decrease in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
to  due to a decline in the amount of commercial and installment loan charge offs during at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was four times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  the allowance for loan losses is considered adequate as of december  table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

changes in the allocation over time reflect changes in the composition of the loan portfolio risk profile and refinements to the methodology of determining the allowance 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future as needed to reflect current conditions

us government agencies decreased million and tax exempt municipal bonds increased by million while mortgage backed securities declined by million due to maturities and repayments 
total investment securities increased million in compared to the year end balance in this increase was attributable to investment of the proceeds from the mortgage loan sale that occurred during the fourth quarter of us government agencies increased million and tax exempt municipal bonds increased by million while mortgage backed securities declined by million due to maturities and repayments 
the significant increase in municipal bonds is part of management s strategy to generate additional tax exempt income 
at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized loss of million

the bank also chose to allow high priced  volatile customer deposits to decline in order to allocate these resources to customers with full banking relationships 
the increase in deposits in resulted primarily from the bank s successful promotion of a month certificate of deposit early in  its purchase of brokered certificates of deposit  and the movement of million in trust money market funds into the bank during the second quarter of at december  and  brokered certificates of deposit amounted to million and million  respectively  or of total deposits at both year ends

this strategy  in conjunction with continued emphasis on increasing low cost in house deposits  was one of the contributing factors to the increase in net interest income and net interest margin in management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million and an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions 
see note to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios

liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  we take advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable us to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   our available borrowing capacity through the fhlb and other financial institutions was approximately million 
we actively manage our liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation s board of directors 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands  which will include completing the renovations to the facility acquired for its operations center 
additionally  liquidity needs for future branch expansion will be evaluated as such opportunities arise 
management anticipates opening additional branches or expanding current facilities in its existing market footprint annually or bi annually for the next several years 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debt 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the corporation without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
management has not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that we become liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a negative impact to net interest income when interest rates increase 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
further discussion of the nature of certain obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referenced in the table below  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
payments due by period contractual obligations in millions note reference total less than year years years more than years long term debt fhlb advances junior subordinated debt operating leases data processing and telecommunications services time deposits pension serp commitment expiration by period commitments in millions note reference total less than year years years more than years loan commitments letters of credit at december   our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to loan commitments and letters of credit discussed above
