this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products  and our future results and is intended to provide the reader of our audited consolidated financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business 
this discussion is presented in the following sections management overview  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies 
we based our statements on assumptions or estimates that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons including those discussed in item a  risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management overview we are a global intimate apparel company with a portfolio of established  well known brands  top selling products and an iconic heritage 
we design  source and market an extensive range of intimate apparel products  including bras  panties and shapewear 
we sell through multiple distribution channels  including department stores and national chain stores  mass merchants including warehouse clubs  other including specialty retailers  off price retailers and licensing income  our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we sell our products under some of the most recognized brands in the intimate apparel industry  including maidenform  flexees  lilyette  sweet nothings  rendezvous  subtract  bodymates and self expressions 
our maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands are broadly sold in department stores and national chain stores 
our other brands are distributed through national chain stores and selected mass merchants 
these other brands leverage our product technology  but are separate brands with distinctly different logos 
in addition to our owned brands  we also supply private brand products to selected retailers 
trends in our business we operate in two segments  wholesale and retail 
our wholesale segment includes both our domestic and international wholesale markets 
our retail segment includes our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we have identified many near term opportunities for growth and operational improvements  as well as challenges to our business 
in particular  management believes that there are many factors influencing the intimate apparel industry  including but not limited to consistent demand for foundation garments  consumer demand for product innovation and leading brands  sourcing and supply chain efficiencies  continued growth of the mass merchant channel  pressure from retailers brought about by the consolidation in the retail industry  increases in the cost of the raw materials used in intimate apparel products and uncertainty surrounding import restrictions 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on or address these trends by  among other things increasing consumer identification with our brands through further marketing investments  continuing to launch innovative products  increasing our presence in department stores and national chain stores through the use of maidenform  flexees  lilyette  rendezvous  subtract and private brands  increasing our presence in the mass merchant channel through the use of our sweet nothings  bodymates  self expressions and private brands  expanding our international presence  being a marketer of our brands  rather than a manufacturer  of intimate apparel  making selective acquisitions  entering into licenses  and developing products and marketing that will complement our existing products or distribution channels  and merchandising  marketing and selling private brand product for selected retailers 
wholesale segment the following trends are among the key variables that will affect our wholesale segment department stores and national chain stores 
the department stores and national chain stores are where we generally sell the maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands 
we plan to continue to invest in increasing our net sales with department store customers  which we believe is important to our long term positioning in the channel 
there has been a trend toward consolidation of department stores 
we expect the rate of our future net sales growth with department stores to be moderated by the reduction in both the number of department store customers and the number of doors distinct locations operated by a particular retailer operated by those customers 
we have grown both our market share and our net sales significantly in the past several years with national chain stores 
we expect to see continued growth with national chain stores in the future as consumers continue to seek out value alternatives and as our customers in this channel continue to open new doors 
we have customers located outside the united states that purchase our maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands 
the majority of these net sales are included in the department store and national chain store channel 
mass merchants 
the mass merchant channel includes both mass merchants and warehouse clubs 
we intend to improve our penetration with mass merchants through the use of our brands sweet nothings  bodymates  and self expressions as well as private brands 
we have experienced significant growth in this channel over the past several years and expect to achieve significant growth in the future as we are able to increase both the floor space and number of doors at which our products are sold 
we expect that both our net sales to this channel and our net sales to this channel as a percentage of our total net sales is likely to increase over time 
the volume and mix of net sales of our brands and of private label in the mass merchants channel can vary from period to period based upon strategic changes that our customers may implement from time to time 
net sales to customers in the mass channel that are located outside the united states are included in this channel 
other 
our net sales from this channel  which include sales to specialty retailers and to off price retailers  have historically been a relatively small component of our overall net sales 
we participate in private brands in the specialty retailer area as opportunities present themselves 
we continually evaluate this channel for opportunities 
licensing income is included in this channel as well as our sales to foreign distributors 
we will selectively target strategic acquisitions or a brand start up to grow our consumer base and would utilize the acquired companies to complement the products  channels and geographic reach of our existing portfolio 
we believe that acquisitions could enhance our product offerings to retailers and provide potential growth 
we believe we can leverage our core competencies such as product development  brand management  logistics and marketing to create significant value from the acquired businesses 
the opportunity to license designer brands is also a potential opportunity for us 
retail segment we believe our retail sales volume is driven by our ability to service our existing consumers and obtain new consumers  as well as overall general economic conditions  such as the general retail environment  that can affect our consumers and ultimately their levels of overall spending 
additionally  identifying optimal retail outlet locations  favorable leasing arrangements  and improving our store productivity are factors important to growing our retail segment s net sales 
we also sell our products through our websites  www 
maidenform 
com and www 
maidenform 
co 
uk 
although we currently do not generate a significant amount of net sales through these sites  we do expect it to continue to grow 
our objectives in our retail segment are to continue to increase the productivity of our portfolio of stores through effective merchandising and focused advertising  as well as selectively closing less productive locations and potentially opening new stores in more productive locations 
even in those situations where we selectively close less productive outlet stores and do not open a new store in that region  we believe those consumers still purchase many of our maidenform brands from our other outlet stores  our websites or our wholesale segment customers that carry these brands 
historically  we have primarily sold excess and  to a lesser extent  obsolete inventories through our outlet stores at a higher margin than that achieved through other liquidation alternatives 
definitions in reviewing our operating performance  we evaluate both the wholesale and retail segments by focusing on each segment s operating income  cash flows from operations and inventory turns 
net sales 
our net sales are derived from two operating segments  wholesale and retail 
our net sales in the wholesale segment are sales recorded net of cooperative advertising allowances  sales returns  sales discounts  and markdown allowances provided to our customers 
net sales in our retail segment are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
cost of sales 
we outsource all manufacturing of the products we sell and  therefore the principal elements of our cost of sales are for finished goods inventories purchased from our sourced vendors 
included in cost of sales and affecting our overall gross margins are freight expenses from the manufacturers to our distribution centers in situations where such expenses are charged separately 
also included in cost of sales is the cost of warehousing  labor and overhead related to receiving and warehousing at our distribution centers  and depreciation of assets related to our receiving and warehousing in our distribution centers 
direct labor  cost of fabrics  as well as raw materials for fabrics  are the primary components driving the overall cost of our sourced finished goods inventories from our sourcing vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
our sg a include all of our marketing  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses for both the wholesale and retail segments which include our retail outlet store payroll and related benefits  and rent expense 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance and legal 
additionally  depreciation related to the shipping function in our distribution centers and our corporate office assets such as furniture  fixtures  and equipment  as well as amortization of intellectual property  is included in sg a 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for more information  see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
net operating loss carryforwards nols enable a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against a future period s profits in order to reduce cash tax liabilities in those future periods 
in periods when a company is generating operating losses  its nols will increase 
the tax effect of the nols is recorded as a deferred tax asset 
if the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the nols  it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
additionally  section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain existing stockholders and  or  new stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points during a three year testing period 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased to reflect both recognized and deemed recognized built in gains that occur during the month period after the ownership change 
upon emergence from bankruptcy in  our nols were subject to section limitations 
as a result of the acquisition defined below in  we experienced a change in control as defined by section as a result of this ownership change  the utilization of our nols were subject to a new annual limitation under section subsequent to the acquisition  sales of our shares by others  including the initial public offering in july  have resulted in additional changes in control for the purpose of section  however  the annual limitation of our nols has not changed 
based on fair values of certain assets as determined in connection with the acquisition  we had approximately million of deemed built in gains that are anticipated to be recognized or deemed recognized during the aforementioned month period 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state nols available for utilization in the years from through acquisition related charges 
on may   mf acquisition corporation acquired of maidenform  inc the acquisition through a merger of its wholly owned subsidiary into maidenform  inc stockholders of maidenform  inc received either cash or stock of mf acquisition corporation in exchange for their shares of maidenform  inc on april   mf acquisition corporation changed its name to maidenform brands  inc our capitalization structure changed significantly as a result of the acquisition 
financing for the acquisition totaled million and was provided by a first lien term loan of million  revolver borrowings of million  a second lien term loan of million and million of cash and capital invested by mf acquisition corporation and other investors  including rollover equity by certain members of management of million and continuing stockholders of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 basis in leveraged buyout transactions 
accordingly  the retained interest of the continuing stockholders the retained by certain members of management and continuing stockholders was recorded at carryover basis 
the remainder of the investment in the assets and liabilities acquired the acquired by new stockholders was recorded at fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over carryover basis of net assets acquired  treated as a deemed dividend of million to continuing stockholders  was recognized as a reduction of stockholders equity deficit 
as a result  the total purchase price of million was allocated to the assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date  after taking into account carryover basis as discussed above 
the estimated fair values were determined by valuation reports provided by independent third party appraisals 
results of operations for discussion purposes only  our results discussed below represent the mathematical addition of the historical results for the predecessor period from december  through may  and the successor period from may  through january  this approach is not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and yields results that are not comparable on a period to period basis due to the new basis of accounting established at the acquisition date 
however  we believe it is the most meaningful way to comment on the results of operations for compared to those of and because a discussion of the partial period from december  through may  predecessor separately from the period from may  through january  successor compared to the period from january  through december  and the period from january  through december  would not be meaningful 
fiscal includes the periods from december  through may  predecessor and may  through january  successor 
the combined consisted of weeks 
although had weeks compared to only weeks in and  had only one more shipping day for our wholesale segment 
therefore  the financial results for the three years are comparable 
our company operated outlet stores and our internet operations include one more week in compared to and but the effect of this extra week on our results of operations is not material

on june   we amended our credit facility by prepaying the total balance of million outstanding on our second lien facility bearing an interest rate of libor plus 
simultaneously  we increased the borrowings on our first lien term facility from million to million and modified the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
the interest rate margin was reduced by on december  due to the completion of our initial public offering and further reduced by as a result of our having a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda leverage ratio of less than to as of the third quarter of the prime rate margin and the libor margin will be determined on a quarterly basis based on our leverage ratio for the preceding four quarters

net loss available to common stockholders 
for the foregoing reasons  our net loss available to common stockholders decreased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in liquidity and capital resources for discussion purposes only  our cash flow data discussed below represent the mathematical addition of the historical cash flow data for the predecessor period from december  through may  and the successor period from may  through january  this approach is not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and yields results that are not comparable on a period to period basis due to the new basis of accounting established at the acquisition date 
however  we believe it is the most meaningful way to comment on the cash flows for compared to and because a discussion of partial periods would not be meaningful 
our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  debt service  our stock repurchase program and capital expenditures 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving facility defined below 
in  we expect to spend a total of approximately million on capital expenditures  driven by information technology upgrades including system enhancements specifically related to distribution operations and expenditures associated with the relocation of our company headquarters 
we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash of million is primarily a result of debt prepayments of million and purchases of our common stock of million 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net income reduced by changes in working capital 
our existing first lien facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition  were amended and restated in june amended and restated credit facility to provide for borrowings in the aggregate amount of million maturing on may  and is comprised of i a million amortizing term loan facility the term loan facility and ii a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility

through december   we repurchased million of common stock at an average price per share of 
the stock repurchase program  which is open ended  allows us to repurchase our shares of common stock on the open market depending on market conditions and other corporate considerations from available cash flow and borrowings under our revolving facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under our term loan facility and we had outstanding and approximately million was available for borrowings under our revolving facility  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
we use the letters of credit as collateral for our workers compensation insurance programs and bonds issued on our behalf to secure our obligation to pay customs duties 
we continued to de leverage our balance sheet with million of debt prepayments during with each debt prepayment  our amortization schedule is revised 
our next scheduled mandatory principal payment will be october  at december   we had a ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of to there will be no mandatory excess cash flow prepayment for because our ratio of debt to ebitda is less than to as of december  the amended and restated credit facility contains affirmative and restrictive covenants  including a maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  b maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio  c limitations on consolidated capital expenditures  d limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens  e limitations on investments acquisitions and f restrictions on payments between maidenform brands  inc and its subsidiaries 
there are a number of circumstances in which additional partial prepayments are required based upon conditions set forth in the amended and restated credit facility  including net asset sales and net insurance condemnation proceeds not reinvested in other assets of the business  net securities proceeds from the issuance of capital stock excluding the initial public offering proceeds  additional debt facilities  and a percentage of annual consolidated excess cash flows  as defined 
the financial covenants for this facility include various restrictions with respect to the company and its wholly owned subsidiary maidenform  inc  including the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between maidenform  inc and its subsidiaries and the company 
at december  and december   maidenform  inc had restricted net assets of approximately million  or  of total net assets and million  or  of total net assets  respectively 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  and december  on july   we priced an initial public offering of  shares of common stock of which  and  shares were offered by us and selling stockholders  respectively  at a price of per share 
upon the consummation of the offering on july   net proceeds of million and million were distributed to us and selling stockholders  respectively 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
approximately million of the net proceeds to us were used to redeem all the outstanding shares of our preferred stock  including shares of preferred stock acquired upon the exercise of all outstanding options to purchase shares of our preferred stock  and to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends associated with the preferred stock and preferred stock options 
the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our revolving facility 
we believe that our existing cash balances and available borrowings under the revolving facility  along with our future cash flow from operations  will enable us to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
operating activities 
in  and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  in cash flow from operations 
cash flow from operations during was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements  partially offset by an increase in net income compared to the primary reason for the increased working capital in was an million increase in inventory at the end of versus a decrease of million in as a result of several factors including  among other things  higher sales volume and our desire to increase our inventory levels for higher customer fulfillment of orders and to take advantage of incremental sales opportunities and meet ongoing sales demand of our products 
another contributing factor was a million decrease in accounts payable at the end of versus an increase of million in this decrease in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts 
accounts receivable increased million at the end of versus an increase of million in as a result of higher wholesale net sales and the timing of cash collections 
the reduction in cash provided by operations did not result in increased borrowings due to the availability of our cash on hand 
cash flows from operations during included the impact of non recurring items such as expenses associated with the initial public offering  a special bonus paid in connection with the credit facility amendment  incremental manufacturing costs as a result of phasing out all internal manufacturing and prepayment fees in connection with our credit facility amendment 
the reduction in cash provided by operations compared to was primarily due to these non recurring items and an increase in working capital requirements in partially offset by an increase in net income  as adjusted for non cash items 
the primary reason for the larger increase in working capital requirements in was a million increase in accounts receivable at the end of versus a decrease of million in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to wholesale net sales increasing in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of in addition  accrued expenses decreased largely as a result of severance payments made in these factors were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in income taxes payable in compared to investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in and cash flows used in investing activities of million in cash flows used in investing activities in were for capital expenditures 
during  cash flows includes proceeds received from the sale of our manufacturing facilities  net of capital expenditures 
the significant use of cash in was primarily due to payments of million related to the acquisition 
financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in and cash flows provided by financing activities of million in the increase in cash used in financing activities for was due to prepayments of our term loan facility outstanding totaling million and the repurchase of common stock as part of our million stock repurchase program totaling million 
cash flows used in financing activities during were primarily from lower net borrowings and the payment of a special preferred stock dividend partially offset by the net proceeds from our initial public offering during the cash provided from financing activities during was primarily from borrowings from new credit facilities entered into at the time of the acquisition  offset by the payment of all debt outstanding at may  contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in fiscal thereafter total in millions long term debt interest on long term debt obligations under capital lease operating leases total financial obligations purchase obligations total financial obligations and commitments for the years through the expiration date of the amended and restated credit facility  we may be required to make annual consolidated excess cash flow payments depending on applicable leverage ratios 
the interest rate for the variable portion of long term debt was the rate in effect at december  includes amounts classified as interest 
unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory purchases 
amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable or other current liabilities are excluded from the table above 
in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments included in the table above  we have pension and post retirement benefit obligations included in other non current liabilities  as further described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension and post retirement plans before the end of september off balance sheet agreements 
our most significant off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  are non cancelable operating lease agreements  primarily for our company operated outlet stores  our new company headquarters and our warehouse distribution center in ireland 
we do not participate in any off balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose us to unrecorded financial obligations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we provide reserves for accounts receivable that may not be realized as a result of uncollectibility  sales returns  markdowns  and other customer allowances 
reserves are determined based on historical experience  credit quality  age of accounts receivable balances  and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we believe that our reserves provide reasonable assurance that such balances are reflected at net realizable value 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of wholesale inventory is based on standard costs  which approximate first in  first out fifo  while the cost of product acquired from third parties for sale through our retail segment is based on the retail inventory method 
we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are evaluated by us for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances exist 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment exists and will perform the impairment evaluation annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
we allocate our goodwill to our reporting units 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
to determine the fair values  we use both a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach 
in reviewing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment  we compare the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
when the estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying amount 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the performance of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests are subject to significant judgment in determining the estimation of future cash flows  the estimation of discount rates  and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are periodically reviewed and evaluated by us when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  this evaluation is based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the related assets 
should such evaluation result in us concluding that the carrying amount of long lived assets has been impaired  an appropriate write down to their fair value is recorded 
revenue recognition 
net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when merchandise is shipped to customers  at which time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
in the case of sales by our retail operations  net sales are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
reserves for sales returns  markdown allowances  cooperative advertising  discounts and other customer deductions are provided when sales are recorded or when the commitment is incurred 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the assessment requires us to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
application of purchase accounting 
the consummation of the acquisition on may  resulted in purchase accounting adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and eitf  basis in leveraged buyout transactions 
see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these purchase accounting entries resulted in a partial step up of our consolidated balance sheet whereby certain of our assets and liabilities were adjusted to reflect approximately of their fair market value and approximately of their historic carrying value 
the fair values of the majority of our assets and liabilities were determined based upon a variety of valuation methods including present value  depreciated replacement cost  market values where available and selling prices less cost to dispose 
valuations were performed by various independent valuation specialists and actuaries for a significant portion of our assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  which were made by us in consultation with specialists  related to discount rates  growth rates  cost of capital  royalty rates  tax rates and remaining useful lives 
we believe that the assumptions used were appropriate and consistent with observable market comparables 
changes to these assumptions could have resulted in significantly different values attributed to assets and liabilities 
these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 
for our trademarks and royalty licenses  which were valued by a third party appraiser  we determined that certain trademarks and royalty licenses have indefinite lives 
this determination was made after consideration of qualitative factors such as the length of time the trade names have been in existence  the strength of the name  the overall legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive and economic environment in which these intangible assets exist and the lack of other factors that would limit the useful life of the underlying asset 
should factors change which would require us to amortize these intangibles  the resulting amortization expense could be material to our results of operations 
accrued expenses 
accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation insurance  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are based on actual commitments 
these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
benefit plans including postretirement plans 
the long term rate of return for our pension plan is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors  such as inflation and interest rates  are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the assets of our pension plan are held in pooled separate accounts and are invested in mutual funds consisting of a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
we use this investment approach in order to meet its diversification and asset allocation goals 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across domestic and foreign stocks  as well as growth  value  and small and large capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements  and periodic asset liability studies 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plan in based upon the current funded status and expected asset return assumptions 
at december   we increased the discount rate assumption from to for the pension plan to reflect changes in the index fund that closely matches our expected pension benefit payouts 
at december   we used a long term rate of return assumption of based on the investment return of our pension plan assets  which are primarily in equity securities 
a decrease or increase in the discount rate would affect our pension expense by less than million 
similarly  a decrease or increase in the expected return on plan assets would affect our pension expense by less than million 
effective on january   the company s pension plan was frozen 
see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the postretirement medical plans are unfunded plans 
we expect to contribute to the plans an amount equal to benefit payments to be made in which are estimated to be million 
changes in assumptions related to our post retirement plans would not materially impact our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of applying fin no 
 if any  will be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period in which it is adopted 
we will adopt fin no 
in the first quarter of we are evaluating our tax position and the impact that the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we do not believe that we have significant foreign currency transactional exposures 
our net sales for the years ended  and in currencies other than us dollars were approximately million  million and million  respectively  of our total net sales 
during the years  and  our net sales were favorably impacted by million  million and million  respectively  due to foreign exchange rates 
most of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our total sourcing is concentrated in two foreign countries  china and indonesia 
the impact of a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the foreign currencies in which we have transactional exposures would be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed through a combination of variable and fixed rate debt composed of long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that we deem appropriate and we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to maintain that balance 
at december   our debt portfolio was composed of variable rate debt of which we hedge approximately to a fixed rate 
with respect to our variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would have had a million impact on our interest expense for  a million impact on our interest expense for  a million impact on our interest expense for the period from may  through january  successor  and a million impact on our interest expense for the period from december  through may  predecessor 
commodity price risk 
we are subject primarily to commodity price risk arising from fluctuations in the market prices of raw materials used in the garments purchased from our sourcing vendors if they pass along these increased costs 
during the past five years  there has been no significant impact from commodity price fluctuations  nor do we currently use derivative instruments in the management of these risks 
on a going forward basis  fluctuations in crude oil prices or petroleum based product prices may also influence the prices of the related items such as chemicals  dyestuffs  man made fibers and foam 
any raw material price increase would increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass our higher costs on to our customers 
inflation risk 
we are affected by inflation and changing prices from our suppliers primarily through the cost of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
seasonality 
we have not experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in our net sales or our profitability
