application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  workers compensation accruals  litigation accruals  pension obligations and stock based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria is performed 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience 
the company s policy allows retail customers a day period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors its off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions 
the discount rate is an important element of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on any remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and will revise estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position

the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company s common stock 
the expected life is based on the simplified method described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
the dividend yield for and prior years was assumed to be zero since the company had not historically declared and did not have a current plan to declare dividends on an ongoing basis until the board of directors authorized and approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend in february  see note 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   or a decrease of million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities over the prior year was driven by growth in receivables of million in  primarily due to the revenue growth in europe in the second half of the year combined with the longer customary payment terms experienced in that region

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk approximately of product sales and licensing revenue recorded in the year ended december   were denominated in united states dollars usd 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in usd  however  purchase prices for products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the usd and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to the company in usd 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on inventory costs 
due to the increase in foreign currency transactions and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner as the usd  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the effect of currency fluctuations on future income 
the company s primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in canada and europe 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps  to manage exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
these financial instruments can be used to protect the company from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically through the income statement or through stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
the classification depends on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  and if so  whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
generally  changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are matched in the income statement against the respective gain or loss relating to the hedged items 
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective as hedges  are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes 
changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in net earnings 
the company s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
thus  changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are included in net earnings 
the following table sets forth information about the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts as of december  currency exchange contracts contract type usd equivalent maturity date current value in usd at dec 
 canadian dollars forward january to january  canadian dollars forward february to february  canadian dollars forward march to march  euros domestic currency swap january  euros domestic currency swap february  euros domestic currency swap march  euros domestic currency swap march  euros forward january  euros forward january  euros forward january  euros forward january  euros forward january  euros forward february  euros forward february  euros forward february  euros forward february  euros forward march  euros forward march  euros forward april  euros domestic currency swap november  to euros domestic currency swap november  to euros domestic currency swap november  to euros domestic currency swap november  to euros domestic currency swap november  to at december   the company had canadian dollar currency exchange contracts to purchase million usd and the current value of those contracts at that date was million usd 
interest rate risk at december   approximately of the company s indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by interest rate swap agreements resulting in a fixed interest rate of over the life of the lease obligation 
changes in the related interest rate will result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap and are reported in other income or expenses 
the change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap had an immaterial impact during substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  principally consisting of short term borrowings under the european revolvers  is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the fair value of the company s debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company s borrowing rate 
at december   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company s debt approximates rates currently available to the company
