sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
cbiz typically experiences a net use of cash from operations during the first quarter of its fiscal year  as accounts receivable balances grow in response to the seasonal increase in first quarter revenue generated by the financial services practice group primarily for accounting and tax services 
this net use of cash is followed by strong operating cash flow during the second and third quarters  as a significant amount of revenue generated by the financial services practice group during the first four months of the year are billed and collected in subsequent quarters 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is was primarily the result of a million income tax refund received during that did not recur in  a decrease in the change in accrued personnel costs of million  and an increase in the change in accounts receivable  net of million

off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains administrative service agreements with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business services financial services  which qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended 
the impact to cbiz of this accounting pronouncement is not material to the financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz  and is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an administrative service agreement 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as amended  
table of contents cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million at december  and in addition  cbiz provides performance bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of performance bonds outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
cbiz has various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or nine month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
during the years ended december  and  management did not utilize interest rate swaps 
during  cbiz sold million in convertible senior subordinated notes notes bearing a fixed interest rate of to qualified institutional buyers 
as the notes mature on june  and have call protection until june   we believe this low cost of borrowing mitigates our interest rate risk 
management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments and auction rate securities ars  which are classified as marketable securities 
ars generally have a high credit quality  are highly liquid  and generate higher rates of return than typical money market investments 
during  the average balance of funds held for clients related to payroll services was approximately million  and the average interest yield was approximately on an after tax basis 
the interest income on these short term investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility float based on market conditions 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to the understanding of cbiz s consolidated financial statements because their application places significant demand on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that estimates may require adjustment if future events develop differently than expected 

table of contents revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below 
financial services revenue consists primarily of fees for accounting services  preparation of tax returns  consulting services including sarbanes oxley consulting and compliance projects  and valuation services including fairness opinions  business plans  litigation support  purchase price allocations and derivative valuations 
revenues are recorded in the period in which services are provided and meet revenue recognition criteria in accordance with sab cbiz bills clients based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee or based on actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus agreed upon out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
through one of its financial services units  cbiz provides flexible benefits administration services to clients  grants access of its proprietary software to third parties  and provides hosting services to these parties 
revenue associated with set up and license fees related to our flexible benefits services are deferred and recognized pro rata over the life of the contract 
employee services revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  payroll service fees  interest on client funds  and fee income for administering health and retirement plans 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on the service provided  insurance product sold  and billing arrangement  is described below 
commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are recognized as of the latter of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer  commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are recognized when the data necessary from the carriers to properly record revenue becomes available  and life insurance commissions are recognized when the policy becomes effective 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions  and reserves for estimated policy cancellations and terminations 
the cancellation and termination reserve is based upon estimates and assumptions using historical cancellation and termination experience and other current factors to project future experience 
cbiz periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
commissions which are based upon certain performance targets are recognized at the earlier of written notification that the target has been achieved  or cash collection 
fee income is recognized in the period in which services are provided  and may be based on actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  fixed fee arrangements  or asset based fees 
payroll revenue is recognized when the actual payroll processing occurs 
medical management professionals fees for services are primarily based on a percentage of net collections on our clients patient accounts receivable 
as such  revenue is determinable  earned  and recognized  when payments are received by our clients on their patient accounts 
revenue earned on statement mailing services is recognized when statements are processed and mailed 
revenue from the sale of billing systems is recognized upon installation of the system  while the related system maintenance revenue is recognized over the period covered by the maintenance agreement 
national practices services the business units that comprise this practice group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below 
technology consulting revenue associated with hardware and software sales is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the product 
revenue associated with installation is recognized as services are performed  
table of contents and revenue associated with service agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the agreement 
consulting revenue is recognized on an hourly or per diem fee basis as services are performed 
health care consulting cbiz bills clients based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee or based on actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus agreed upon out of pocket expenses  or as a percentage of savings after contingencies have been resolved and verified by a third party 
mergers acquisitions and capital advisory revenue associated with non refundable retainers is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the engagement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions is recognized when the transaction is completed 
certain of our client arrangements encompass multiple deliverables 
cbiz accounts for these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the deliverables meet the criteria in eitf  the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
revenue for each unit is recognized separately in accordance with cbiz s revenue recognition policy for each unit 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and evaluated for appropriate accounting treatment based upon the underlying facts and circumstances 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable  including unbilled accounts receivable  related to current period service revenue 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectibility of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
intangible assets  which include client lists and non compete agreements  are amortized principally by the straight line method over their expected period of benefit  not to exceed ten years 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
there was no goodwill impairment during the years ended december    or loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 

table of contents incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation can not be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions and requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the estimated cumulative effect of adopting fin is expected to be an increase in the opening balance of retained earnings on january  of between million and million

interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a 
table of contents change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by the bank of america  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
although cbiz did not have a balance outstanding under its credit facility at december   cbiz may borrow funds under its credit facility in future periods which could expose the company to interest rate risk 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions
