for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item a 
risk factors and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes g wireless pc card and expresscard modems  embedded modems  communications software and fmc solutions for wireless network operators  infrastructure providers  distributors  oems and vertical markets worldwide 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on a majority of global wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer software engineering  integration and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
our strong customer relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales 
most of our sales to wireless operators and oems are sold directly through our sales force 
to a lesser degree  we also use an indirect sales distribution model through the use of select distributors 
we are continuing to drive widespread adoption of our products through increased global marketing activities  expansion of our sales team and distribution networks and continued leverage of our strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wan technology  ease of use  performance  size  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on time to market  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
we have agreements with lg innotek and iac for the outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  lg innotek and iac provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery services 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution and fulfillment services related to our business in europe  middle east  and africa  or emea 
factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products and this may place significant demands on our resources 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the increase in demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  increase in competition  timing of deployment of g networks by carriers  drop in demand for ev do  umts and hsdpa products  and changes in technologies 
we began shipping our first g products in december we have shipped new g products since then and anticipate introducing additional g products during we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like alcatel  siemens  dell  qualcomm  sprint pcs  verizon wireless and vodafone and major software vendors 
through strategic relationships  we have been able to increase market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
our strategic relationships include technology and marketing relationships with wireless operators  oem customers that integrate our products into other devices  distributors and leading hardware and software technology providers 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to lg innotek and iac 
in addition  we currently outsource certain distribution and fulfillment services related to our business in emea to mobiltron 
all costs associated with these manufacturers and mobiltron are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalties based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to development services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during  and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million and  respectively  primarily due to the decrease in demand for the affected products 
we expect to continue to outsource our manufacturing operations  and as our business grows we expect our manufacturing activity to increase 
operating expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in europe  north america and asia 
if these markets continue to grow  we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing revenue from these contracts 
the accounting for stock options began in the first quarter of and required us to use the fair value method to account for all stock based compensation pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r  which significantly increased our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  useful lives  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  provision for warranty costs  royalty accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  foreign exchange forward contracts  and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oem customers and distributors  and  to a lesser extent  from development services contracts 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the latest of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
for product sales with acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized at such time that the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns and price protection in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices  and historical trends 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
during  we amended a joint development agreement containing multiple elements with one of our customers including development services and product shipments 
accordingly  we separated the deliverables into units of accounting and allocated arrangement consideration to these deliverables in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 million in cash payments received in was deferred and was recognized as revenue when products were shipped or as development services were performed 
during  we recognized approximately million of this deferred revenue and the remaining  was recognized during the first quarter of we do not expect development services revenue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual allowance for doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand as discussed under revenue above  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their fair values  which are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically three to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that changes rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual warranty costs 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially different than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
we have also accrued for estimated royalty costs in situations where we do not have agreements based upon our current best estimate of the royalty obligation 
these estimates are based on various market data information and other relevant information 
if we enter into such agreements  or when additional market data becomes available  we will revise our estimates if necessary 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
during and  we recorded a non cash deferred income tax benefit of million and million  respectively  for the reversal of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
see further discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
foreign exchange forward contracts 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the economic exposure associated with accounts receivable balances denominated in euros 
our forward contracts do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we mark to market the forward contracts and include unrealized gains and losses in the current period as a component of other income expense 
during  and  we recorded unrealized losses of approximately million  million and  respectively  on our forward contracts 
these unrealized losses were offset by foreign currency gains of approximately million  losses of approximately million  and losses of approximately  respectively  recorded in other income and expense 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
share based compensation 
we grant stock options and restricted stock to our employees and non employee directors under our current stock plan 
the benefits provided under this plan are share based payments subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
as a result of this new accounting requirement  our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  include compensation expense as calculated per the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in adopting sfas no 
r  we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  thus our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  do not include any impact of sfas no 
r 
we also elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method for awards granted after december  upon our adoption of sfas no 
r 
share based compensation expense for awards outstanding as of december  are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense calculated according to the pro forma disclosure provisions under sfas no 
 which uses the straight line expense recognition method for those awards with a graded vesting schedule 
share based compensation expense related to stock options  our espp and restricted stock was million for the year ended december  upon adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we elected to value our share based payment option awards using the black scholes option pricing model as we had under the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
the determination of fair value of share based awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these significant assumptions include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of stock options 
we determined our expected volatility by using a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  to derive our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas no 
r and sab no 
implied volatility was based on three month traded options of our common stock 
we determined that the volatility calculated using a blend of implied volatility and our historical volatility was more reflective of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term of options granted is estimated using the average of the vesting date  the contractual term and historical experience 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value under the black scholes option pricing model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of our stock 
our risk free interest rate assumption is based upon currently available rates on zero coupon us government issues for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend rate is not applicable to us as we have not historically declared or paid dividends nor do we currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and we have estimated our forfeitures based on historical experience 
we will revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from our estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
if we change any of the critical assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model such as expected volatility or expected term or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  as the guidance by regulators for sfas no 
r is relatively new  the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole  eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host  if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
in addition  among other changes  sfas no 
i clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 ii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iii clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and iv eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial interest 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively and is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after september  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes by prescribing guidance for the recognition  derecognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits be disclosed 
the application of fin may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets 
the company will be required to adopt fin as of january  if there are changes in the net assets of the company as a result of the application of fin  the cumulative effects  if any  will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of fin and have not yet determined the effect on our earnings or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value using generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the effect on our earnings or financial position

revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the overall increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our ev do products  which includes our ev do expresscard and ev do fixed mobile convergence products that were introduced in the second half of the increase in ev do product sales for the year ended december  compared to was approximately million 
our umts hsdpa product sales decreased by approximately million during compared to the decrease in sales of our umts hsdpa products was the result of a technology transition from umts to hsdpa during the overall decrease in umts hsdpa revenue was partially offset by strong sales of our hsdpa expresscards and hsdpa embedded modules which were introduced during the second half of overall  ev do revenue  which consists primarily of north american products  represented approximately of revenue in compared to in while umts hsdpa products represented approximately of revenue in compared to in there was no revenue recognized from development services during the year ended december  compared to approximately  for cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the increase in cost of revenue was primarily related to an increase of product cost of million due to the increase in product sales and additional costs associated with new products introduced  as discussed above 
in addition  freight and distribution costs increased by approximately million due to the additional volume of products shipped in compared to the remaining increase in costs of revenue primarily consists of an increase in royalty costs for intellectual property licenses of million  a million increase in warranty costs  and an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of approximately  during compared to in addition  cost of revenue was negatively impacted by approximately  of share based compensation expense recorded during the year ended december  related to the adoption of sfas no

gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was attributable to additional costs incurred for new products introduced during the year  recognition of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense  and sales of products with lower margins in as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in salary and related expenses  which includes million of share based compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
other increases consist of depreciation expenses of approximately million due to capital equipment purchases  increase in outside consulting services of approximately million  and an increase of approximately  in facility expenses as compared to in addition  there were no costs recovered from customer funded development contracts compared to approximately  recovered in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing efforts which included hiring new personnel during primarily to expand our european sales team resulting in increased salary and related expenses of million  which includes million of share based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  product marketing and advertising expenses increased million  leasehold expenses increased  and travel and related expenditures increased  in compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salary and related expenses of million  which includes million of share based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
general and administrative expenses also include an increase in professional service and legal fees of approximately  an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately  and an increase in bad debts expense of approximately  during as compared to other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to the increase in our foreign exchange gains on our euro denominated receivable and cash balances 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit and related deferred tax asset recorded during was primarily due to a revision of our valuation allowance on specific canadian and us deferred tax assets of approximately million 
during  management evaluated the deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that the valuation allowance on a portion of the canadian and us deferred tax assets should be revised and as a result  the company recorded a non cash deferred income tax benefit to the statements of operations of million for the year ended december  this determination was based on  and operating results and in anticipation of using net operating losses due to current projections of future taxable income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately negative  excluding the valuation allowance revision 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the impact of accounting for share based compensation  for which certain share based awards are treated as permanent differences 
for  income tax expense was approximately million  which consists of federal and state taxes at our estimated effective tax rate of offset by a revision of our valuation allowance on specific us deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the difference between the federal and state statutory rate of approximately and our effective tax rate is due primarily to research and development credits generated in and a low effective state tax rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards associated with our share based compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and restricted stock  but under current accounting standards we cannot recognize a tax benefit currently for those share based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  and for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million associated with total share based compensation 
the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in an increase of percentage points to the annual effective tax rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished 
net income 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income available to common stockholders of approximately  which includes non cash share based compensation expense of approximately million after tax  as compared to net income of million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the overall increase in revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in product sales of approximately million primarily due to strong demand for our umts u and ev do pc cards  which were both introduced during the fourth quarter of the overall increase in cdma ev do product sales in was approximately million 
our umts hsdpa product sales  which include the fixed mobile convergence products that were introduced during the first quarter of  increased by approximately million in compared to the increase in revenue was also attributable to the overall increase in demand for our wireless products and wireless access services  which is the direct result of the continued deployment of g networks throughout europe  north america  asia and africa 
revenue recognized for development services decreased by million  or  to  during as compared to million in we do not expect development services revenue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million compared to million in the increase in cost of revenues was primarily related to an increase in product cost of million due to the increase in revenues as discussed above 
in addition  freight and distribution costs increased by approximately million due to additional costs associated with our european product sales 
the remaining increases in costs of sales consisted of an increase of approximately million related to the write off of certain legacy products in inventory and an increase in royalty costs of approximately million 
the cost of revenues was favorably impacted by a decrease in development service costs from million in to  in gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume of our products 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the negative impact of competitive pricing pressures on our sales prices in europe  write offs of inventory as discussed above  and the additional freight and distribution costs associated with our move towards a direct distribution model in europe in research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in research and development expenses increased as a result of additional staff and products developed in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses due to additional headcount  an increase in outside consulting services and travel costs of approximately million  an increase of million in research supplies and expendable equipment due to increased product development activities in as compared to  an increase in facility and depreciation expenses of approximately million due to facility expansions and capital equipment purchases 
in addition  costs recovered from customer funded development contracts decreased by million  to  compared to million for sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily a result of an increase in sales and marketing efforts  which included hiring new personnel during to expand our european sales team  which increased salary and related expenses by approximately million  an increase in marketing expenses of approximately  an increase in rent and utilities expense of  due primarily to facility expansions and an increase in travel costs of approximately  compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees of approximately million due largely to costs associated with complying with the requirements of sarbanes oxley as well as tax accounting fees associated with consulting services related to evaluating our ability to utilize our net operating losses  and an increase in salary and related expenses of approximately million due to additional headcount during as compared to interest income and expense 
interest income and expense increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the increase in our average cash and marketable securities balances in  as well as an increase in the average yields realized on our marketable securities and cash balances  which resulted in higher income yielded as compared to provision for income taxes 
income tax expense was approximately million for  which consists of federal and state taxes at our estimated effective tax rate of offset by a revision of our valuation allowance on specific us deferred tax assets of approximately million

in addition  we recorded a credit of million to stockholders equity relating to the reduction of the valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards from stock option deductions 
the difference between the federal and state statutory rate of approximately and our effective tax rate is due primarily to research and development credits generated in and a low effective state tax rate

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by fiscal year total operating leases committed purchase orders total contractual obligations other liquidity needs during the next twelve months we plan to incur approximately million to million for capital expenditures and the acquisition of additional licenses 
in addition  certain of our operating leases related to facilities obligate us to pay an aggregate of approximately  net of sublease income  over the next months 
this obligation is included in the operating lease commitments in the above table 
we believe that our available cash and investments together with our operating cash flows and available borrowings under our line of credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations  including the continued expansion of our sales and marketing team  the further development of our new products and the related increase in our general and administrative expenses  and to satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months

our future revenue is dependent on us fulfilling our commitments under agreements with a small number of major customers 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations  a material failure to satisfy these contractual commitments or a failure to generate additional revenue from new or existing products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  approximately million of our sales transactions were denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our accounts receivable balances we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items 
we believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all of our outstanding foreign currency contracts are marked to market  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of other income and expense 
as of december  the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
during  we recorded unrealized losses of approximately million on our forward contracts 
these unrealized losses were offset by foreign currency gains of approximately million recorded in other income and expense related primarily to our foreign currency receivable balances denominated in euros during revenues generated outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues were approximately for the fiscal year ended december  and for significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact future operating results
