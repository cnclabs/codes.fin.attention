item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business track data corporation the company is a financial services company that provides real time financial market data  fundamental research  charting and analytical services to institutional and individual investors through dedicated telecommunication lines and the internet 
the company also disseminates news and third party database information from more than sources worldwide 
the company owns tdsc  a registered securities broker dealer and member of the national association of securities dealers  inc the company provides a proprietary  fully integrated internet based online trading and market data system  protrack  for the professional institutional traders  and mytrack and mytrack pro  for the individual trader 
the company also operates track ecn  an electronic communications network that enables traders to display and match limit orders for stocks 
the company s operations are classified in three business segments professional market market data services and trading  including ecn services  to the institutional professional investment community  non professional market internet based online trading and market data services to the non professional individual investor community  and arbitrage trading 
relevant factors the company s professional market segment revenues experienced significant declines since from a combination of staffing reductions in the securities industry  the use by customers of internally developed services  or lower priced services offered by the company or other vendors 
this trend has continued into one customer  with monthly revenues of approximately  cancelled a customized market data service in march  despite the addition of new subscribers to track ecn  the company has not been able to significantly increase revenues 
profit margins are very low in this business and significant volume is necessary to have an impact on the results of operations 
until october   track ecn displayed orders submitted by its subscribers on nasdaq s trading platform 
broker dealers could access this liquidity through nasdaq 
nasdaq was authorized to operate as an exchange and track ecn was no longer able to operate its business on nasdaq s platform 
track ecn currently operates on nasd s adf and nsx blade platforms 
this change has resulted in significantly lower revenues 
the company commenced self clearing of its ecn business at the end of the third quarter of in an effort to decrease costs associated with ecn revenues 
although tdsc has approval from nasd r for clearing of its track ecn business  it is a limited approval for it to submit two sided trade data respecting trades which were executed by broker dealers on the track ecn 
tdsc submits this data to the national securities clearing corporation so that the actual trading counterparties can compare  clear and settle their trades and  except in the case of a rare error  tdsc drops out of the clearing process 
this effort to self clear was a step to reduce costs of having a third party handle this function 
the non professional market segment revenues have been inconsistent month to month but have been down overall when compared to the same periods in the prior year 
the company recently introduced mytrack pro  a trading software for the active trader  with a focus on options trading 
the company is attempting to grow revenues in this segment  principally through marketing alliances and limited advertising to attract new customers  and by offering additional services to existing customers 
the company presently offers trading of us based stocks  options and e mini futures 
the trading and market data services for both segments require the company to maintain a market data ticker plant on a basis  as well as all back office trading functions 
the company s focus is to increase revenues in both segments  as the underlying costs of maintaining the operations and back office will not increase commensurate with any revenue increase  allowing greater operating margins on incremental revenues 
the company engages in arbitrage trading activity 
the company s trading strategy consists principally of establishing hedged positions consisting of stocks and options 
the company is subject to market risk in attempting to establish a hedged position  as the market prices could change  precluding a profitable hedge 
in these instances  any positions that were established for this hedge would be immediately sold  usually resulting in small losses 
if the hedged positions are successfully established at the prices sought  the positions generally stay until the next option expiration date  resulting in small gains  regardless of market value changes in these securities 
while virtually all positions are liquidated at option expiration date  certain stock positions remain 
the liquidation of these positions generally results in small profits or losses 
from time to time  losses may result from certain dividends that may have to be delivered on positions held  as well as from certain corporate restructurings and mergers that may not have been taken into account when the positions were originally established 
ii in connection with the arbitrage trading activity  the company incurs margin loans 
the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to these margin loans 
the level of trading in the arbitrage trading account is partially dependent on the margin value of track data common stock pledged by its principal stockholder and innodata common stock  which is used as collateral 
the market value of such securities is dependent on future market conditions for these companies over which the company has little or no control

the company s professional market segment had revenues for the years ended december  and of  and  respectively  an increase of for this segment 
the company s non professional market segment had revenues of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  an increase of for this segment 
the increase in revenues was attributable to the company s track ecn which increased from  to  however  ecn revenues have low margins compared to higher margins lost from reduced market data services 
track ecn has recently been successful in attracting new subscribers 
until october   track ecn displayed orders submitted by its subscribers on nasdaq s trading platform 
broker dealers could access this liquidity through nasdaq 
nasdaq was authorized to operate as an exchange and track ecn was no longer able to operate its business on nasdaq s platform 
track ecn currently operates on nasd s adf and nsx blade platforms

since  the company has experienced a decline in revenues from its market data services to the professional market segment due principally to staffing reductions in the securities industry  the use by customers of internally developed services  or lower priced services that are offered by the company or other vendors 
increased revenues from the company s track ecn and its newsware division mostly offset the decline in market data revenues  however  these increased revenues did not offset the reduction in profits due to the low margins realized on increased ecn revenues compared to higher margins lost from reduced market data services 
in the non professional market segment  the company experienced a decline in the number of customers actively trading and  accordingly  reduced revenues due to significantly lower trading volumes and market data revenues

the company may borrow up to of eligible market data service receivables as defined  and is required to maintain a compensating balance of of the outstanding loans 
at december   the company had borrowings of  under the line

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results when different assumptions are utilized 
we believe that our principal critical accounting policies are described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from market data and ecn services as services are performed 
billings in advance of services provided are recorded as unearned revenues 
all other revenues collected in advance of services are deferred until services are rendered 
the company earns commissions as an introducing broker and for licensing its trading system for the transactions of its customers 
commissions and related clearing expenses are recorded on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur 
for ecn services  transaction fees are earned on a per trade basis  based on shares transacted  and are recognized as transactions occur 
for each transaction executed  there is an associated liquidity payment or routing charge paid 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  the company records such expenses as liquidity payments or routing charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
marketable securities arbitrage marketable securities transactions are recorded on trade date 
gains and losses are recognized based on closed transactions and the difference between market value and cost at balance sheet date 
the company classifies its investments in innodata and edgar online as available for sale securities 
the company carries these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income when realized 
the company reviews these holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if the company believes that an other than temporary decline exists in the marketable securities  the equity investments are written down to market value and an investment loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
ii long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by the assets to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimated cash flows and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of income

the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the application of the interpretation on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it codifies the definitions of fair value included in other authoritative literature  clarifies and  in some cases  expands on the guidance for implementing fair value measurements  and increases the level of disclosure required for fair value measurements 
although sfas applies to and amends the provisions of existing authoritative literature  it does not  of itself  require any new fair value measurements  nor does it establish valuation standards 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to its credit facility with a financial institution  which is priced based on the prime rate of interest 
at december   there was  outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the prime interest rate during fiscal will have a positive or negative effect on the company s interest expense 
such exposure will increase should the company maintain higher levels of borrowing during assuming debt remains constant  a change in interest rates would not be material to the company s interest expense 
the company has significant positions in stocks and options and receives significant proceeds from the sale of trading securities sold but not yet purchased under the arbitrage trading strategy described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the arbitrage trading activity  the company incurs margin loans 
the company is exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to these margin loans 
such exposure will increase should the company maintain higher levels of borrowing 
the level of trading in the arbitrage trading account is partially dependent on the value of the company s common stock pledged by its principal stockholder and innodata common stock  which is used as collateral 
the market value of such securities is dependent on future market conditions for these companies over which the company has little or no control 
if the stock collateral is not available  the company will decrease its trading or seek additional collateral 
the company conducts business through a clearing broker  which settles all trades for the company  on a fully disclosed basis  on behalf of its customers 
the company earns commissions as an introducing broker for the transactions of its customers 
in the normal course of business  the company s customer activities involve the execution of various customer securities transactions 
these activities may expose the company to off balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and the company has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the obligation at a loss 
at december   the company had million in margin credit extended to its customers
