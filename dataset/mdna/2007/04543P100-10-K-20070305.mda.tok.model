com are to the nilson report  issue  dated july  and issue  dated june company overview we have been purchasing and collecting defaulted or charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers  consumer finance companies  healthcare providers  retail merchants  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we are able to purchase them at a substantial discount 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
during  we invested million net of buybacks in charged off consumer receivable portfolios  with an aggregate face value of billion  or of face value excluding the million receivable portfolio acquired in the stock purchase of parc 
we have seen prices for charged off accounts receivable portfolios increase to relatively high levels over the past three to four years as a result of increased competition 
the increase continued during as our percentage cost of face value increased to from during and  respectively 
we cannot give any assurances about future prices either overall or within account or asset types 
we are determined to remain disciplined and purchase portfolios only when we believe we can achieve acceptable returns 
the growth rate of cash collections for the three month and twelve month periods ending december  slowed to and  respectively  from and for the three month and twelve month periods ending december   respectively 
during  cash collections increased to million 
total revenues for were million  a increase over the prior year 
the lower increase of for total revenues compared to the increase of for cash collections is primarily due to lower average internal rates of return assigned to recent purchases 
operating expenses were million or of cash collections for and million or of cash collections for net income was million for  compared to million for net income for and included net impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the net impairment charges reduced purchased receivables revenue and the carrying value of the purchased receivables 
during  legal cash collections constituted of total cash collections compared to for legal collections continue to increase as a percentage of total collections 
this trend is a result of an increase in the volume of suits initiated over the last couple of years 
we regularly utilize unaffiliated third parties  primarily attorneys and other collection agencies  to collect certain account balances on our behalf 
the percent of gross collections from such third parties has increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased forwarding of legal accounts to third party attorneys 
on april   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with parc and its wholly owned subsidiary  outcoll services  inc under the terms of the agreement  the company acquired of the outstanding shares of 
table of contents parc for million  including four non compete agreements with key individuals 
additionally  we entered into two employment agreements with key individuals 
during  we repurchased  shares for million of which  shares for million with an average purchase price of per share were under a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors on june  during  our cash balance declined to million on december  from million on december   caused in part by an increase of million invested in charged off consumer receivable portfolios to million invested during from million invested during the additional decline in the cash balance also resulted from the million repurchase of  shares of which  shares  under the stock repurchase program  were repurchased for million 
in addition  we had borrowings of million against our line of credit during for the funding of the investment in fourth quarter purchased receivables 
furthermore  we acquired of the outstanding shares of parc for million 
on march   we filed a current report with the sec on form k reporting our plans to close our white marsh  maryland and wixom  michigan offices in closing these two offices will reduce occupancy expenses by approximately million per year 
we do not expect there to be a meaningful reduction of other operating expenses  such as salaries and benefits  as a result of this office consolidation effort 
we plan to offer relocation benefits to certain maryland employees and plan to replace most other maryland revenue generating positions in our remaining call center locations 
additionally  we plan to offer positions to all the wixom  michigan associates in the warren  michigan headquarters 
in conjunction with these office closings we will incur approximately million in restructuring charges 
this includes one time termination benefits of approximately million  accelerated depreciation charges on furniture and equipment of approximately million  contract termination costs of approximately million for the remaining lease payments on the wixom  michigan office  and other exit costs of approximately million 
the termination benefits and other exit costs will require the outlay of cash  while the accelerated depreciation represents non cash charges 
the decision to consolidate call center locations was made in the first quarter of and accordingly the financial impact is not reflected in our december  financial statements 
the actions to close the white marsh  maryland and wixom  michigan offices are expected to be substantially complete by december  refer to the risk factor we could determine that we have excess capacity and reduce the size of our workforce or close additional remote call center locations  which could negatively impact our ability to collect on our portfolios on page industry overview the accounts receivable management industry is growing  driven by a number of industry trends  including increasing levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the consumer credit industry increased from billion of consumer debt obligations in to trillion of consumer debt obligations in november  a compound annual growth rate of 
the kaulkin ginsberg report estimates that billion of consumer debt is sold and re sold annually in the us increasing charge offs of the underlying receivables according to the nilson report  net charge offs of credit card debt have increased from billion in to billion in  a compound annual growth rate of 
the nilson report is forecasting an increase in the net charge offs of credit card debt to billion in increasing types of credit originators accessing the debt sale market according to the nilson report  the cost for all types of purchased debt sold has increased from billion in to billion in  a 
table of contents compound annual growth rate of 
sellers of charged off portfolios have expanded to include healthcare  utility and telecommunications providers  commercial banks  consumer finance companies  retail merchants and mortgage  auto finance companies and chapter and chapter bankruptcies 
in addition  according to the kaulkin ginsberg report  classes of debt are expanding to include landlord tenant and geographic specialization types of portfolios 
historically  credit originators have sought to limit credit losses either through using internal collection efforts with their own personnel or outsourcing collection activities to third party collectors 
credit originators that outsource the collection of charged off receivables have typically remained committed to third party providers as a result of the perceived economic benefit of outsourcing and the resources required to establish the infrastructure required to support in house collection efforts 
the credit originator can pursue an outsourced solution by either selling its charged off receivables for immediate cash proceeds or by placing charged off receivables with a third party collector on a contingent fee basis while retaining ownership of the receivables 
in the event that a credit originator sells receivables to a debt purchaser such as us  the credit originator receives immediate cash proceeds and eliminates the costs and risks associated with internal recovery operations 
the purchase price for these charged off receivables are generally discounted more than from their face values  depending on the amount the purchaser anticipates it can recover and the anticipated effort required to recover that amount 
credit originators  as well as other holders of consumer debt  utilize a variety of processes to sell receivables  including the following competitive bids for specified portfolios through a sealed bid or  in some cases  an on line process  privately negotiated transactions between the credit originator or other holder of consumer debt and a purchaser  and forward flow contracts  which commit a debt seller to sell  and a purchaser to acquire  a steady flow of charged off consumer receivables periodically over a specified period of time  usually no less than three months  for a fixed percentage of the face value of the receivables 
we believe a debt purchaser s ability to successfully collect payments on charged off receivables  despite previous collection efforts by the credit originator or third party collection agencies  is driven by several factors  including the purchaser s ability to pursue collections over multi year periods  tailor repayment plans based on a consumer s ability to pay  and utilize experience and resources  including litigation 
history and reorganization lee acceptance company was formed in for the purpose of purchasing and collecting charged off consumer receivables 
the business of purchasing and collecting charged off consumer receivables was conducted through several successor companies 
on september   we formed asset acceptance holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  for the purpose of consummating an equity recapitalization 
effective september   aac investors  inc acquired a equity interest in asset acceptance holdings  llc 
after september   the business of purchasing and collecting charged off debt previously conducted by aac holding corp 
and its subsidiaries and the business of financing sales of consumer product retailers previously conducted by consumer credit corp 
were effected through this newly formed company and its subsidiaries 
immediately prior to our february initial public offering  all of the shares of capital stock of aac investors  inc and aac holding corp 
which changed its name to rbr holding corp 
in october  which held and  respectively  of the equity membership interests in asset acceptance holdings  llc  were contributed to asset acceptance capital corp  a newly formed delaware corporation  in exchange for shares of common stock of asset acceptance capital corp  which is the class of common stock offered in our initial public offering 
as a result of this reorganization  which was effected for the purpose of establishing a delaware corporation as the issuer in our initial public offering  asset acceptance holdings  llc and its subsidiaries became 
table of contents indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the newly formed asset acceptance capital corp 
in addition  rbr holding corp  which was structured as an s corporation under the internal revenue code  became taxable as a c corporation after becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of asset acceptance capital corp

operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because of varying amortization rates  which is the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  from period to period  due to seasonality of collections and other factors that can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections

table of contents seasonality our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections within portfolios tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections within portfolios tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level due to the application of the interest method for revenue recognition 
in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter

the decline in our cash balance resulted from an increase of million invested in charged off consumer receivable portfolios to million invested in from million invested during the additional decline in the cash balance also resulted from our million repurchase of  shares of common stock 
furthermore  we acquired of the outstanding shares of parc for million 
our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and were generated primarily from net income earned through cash collections 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was reduced by a million cash payment of withholding taxes and employer taxes related to the share appreciation rights 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used for investing purposes was primarily due to 
table of contents acquisitions of purchased receivables  net of cash collections applied to principal  acquisition of parc  net of cash acquired  as well as purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the million repurchase of  shares in accordance with the stock repurchase program  which was a considerable portion of the million repurchase of  shares  as well as the million repayment of parc s loan balances on the date of acquisition  which was partially offset by million of borrowings against the line of credit to fund the investment in purchased receivables 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to repayments on capital lease obligations 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to repayments on our line of credit  net of borrowings  and the repayment of our related party notes payable offset by proceeds from our initial public offering 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowing available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital or to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or we may seek to increase the availability under our line of credit 
future contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  year ending december  thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchased receivables line of credit employment agreements total during  we renewed one forward flow contract  entered into two new forward flow contracts as well as acquired two on going forward flow contracts that commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face amount of the receivables 
the three forward flow contracts have terms beyond december with the last contract expiring in october the three forward flow contracts have estimated monthly purchases of approximately  depending upon circumstances  and the other two on going forward flow contracts have estimated monthly purchases of approximately  over the next twelve months 
to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our line of credit  it would be due in may off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we utilize the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables because we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated 
this belief is predicated on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
the interest method is prescribed by the accounting standards executive committee practice bulletin pb  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans as well as the accounting standards executive committee statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of sop in january and apply sop to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend pb for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to receivables acquired before january  purchased receivables acquired before january  will continue to be accounted for under pb  as amended  for provisions related to decreases in expected cash flows 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an internal rate of return irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the irr may be adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
effective january  under sop  if the revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are primarily based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and result in an impairment being recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our variable line of credit 
the average borrowings on the variable line of credit were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  interest expense would have increased approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the estimated increase in interest expense is based on the portion of our variable interest debt that is not offset by interest rate swap agreements and assumes no changes in the volume or composition of the debt 
interest rate fluctuations do not have a material impact on interest income from 
table of contents cash equivalents or available for sale investments 
as of december   we have million of borrowings against our variable line of credit 
we currently do not have any swap or hedge agreements outstanding
