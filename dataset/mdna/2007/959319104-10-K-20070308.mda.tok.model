item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending for a discussion of our capital expenditures budget 
initial public offering in january  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock sold by us  and certain of our stockholders who sold an aggregate of  shares including over allotment of common stock held by them 
the initial public offering price was per share 
our net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
we did not receive any of the net proceeds from any sales of shares of common stock by any selling stockholders 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering were used as follows to repay million of outstanding term loan debt  and to replenish cash that was used to fund a million distribution to the partners of western refining lp immediately prior to the offering 
also in connection with our initial public offering  pursuant to a contribution agreement  a reorganization of entities under common control was consummated whereby western refining  inc became the indirect owner of the historical operating subsidiary  western refining lp and all of its refinery assets 
this reorganization was accomplished by western refining  inc issuing  shares of its common stock to certain entities controlled by our majority stockholder in exchange for the membership and partner interests in the entities that owned western refining lp 
pending acquisition on august   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with giant industries  inc  or giant  under which we would acquire all of the outstanding shares of giant 
on november   the parties entered into an amendment to the merger agreement 
if the transaction closes  we will acquire giant s common stock for per share in cash 
the transaction has been approved by the board of directors of both companies 
on february   giant s shareholders voted to approve the transaction 
the closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions  including compliance with the pre merger notification requirements of the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  or hsr act 
the transaction is valued at approximately billion  including approximately million of giant s outstanding debt  and is not subject to any financing conditions 
we and giant filed pre merger notifications with the us antitrust authorities pursuant to the hsr act on september  we and giant subsequently entered into an agreement with the federal trade commission  or ftc  on february   in which both companies agreed i to respond to additional information requests  ii not to certify substantial compliance with the information requests until march   and iii not to close our merger with giant until days after we and giant certify substantial compliance 
additionally  on november   timothy bisset filed a class action complaint in arizona state court against giant  its directors and us in connection with the merger 
mr 
bisset alleges that giant and its directors breached their fiduciary duty in voting to amend the definitive merger agreement to provide for  among other things  a lower acquisition price of per share 
mr 
bisset also alleges that we aided and abetted this breach of fiduciary duty 
he also alleges that he and other public stockholders of giant s common stock are entitled to enjoin the proposed amended transaction or  alternatively  to recover damages in the event the transaction is completed 

table of contents we expect to complete our merger with giant during the second quarter of we cannot specify when  or assure that  we and giant will satisfy or waive all conditions to the merger 
further  there can be no assurance that the ftc  state antitrust authorities  or mr 
bisset  will not seek injunctive relief to prevent the merger from taking place 
after completing the transaction  western will have a total crude oil throughput capacity of approximately  bpd 
in addition to our  bpd refinery in el paso  we will gain an east coast presence with a  bpd refinery in yorktown  virginia and will gain two refineries in the four corners region of northern new mexico with a current combined capacity of  bpd 
our primary operating areas will encompass the mid atlantic region  far west texas  phoenix  tucson  albuquerque  northern mexico  and the four corners region of utah  colorado  arizona  and new mexico 
in addition to the four refineries  our asset portfolio will include refined products terminals in flagstaff  arizona and albuquerque  as well as asphalt terminals in phoenix  tucson  albuquerque and el paso 
our asset base will also include retail service stations and convenience stores in arizona  colorado and new mexico  a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports  and three wholesale petroleum products distributors phoenix fuel co  inc  or phoenix fuel  primarily in arizona  dial oil co 
primarily in new mexico and empire oil co 
primarily in california 
by expanding our refining operations from one to four facilities  we will significantly diversify our operations 
in addition  we will double our lower cost sour and heavy crude processing capacity as a percent of our total capacity from approximately currently to almost 
our sour and heavy crude processing capacity will reach by the end of  following the completion of our previously announced acid and sulfur gas facilities and our gasoline desulfurization projects at our el paso refinery 
the yorktown refinery also has the flexibility to incorporate future growth initiatives given its ability to process cost advantaged feedstocks 
we currently generate most of our revenues from our refining operations in el paso 
following the closing of the merger  we will generate revenue from four different refineries as well as a diverse mix of complementary retail and wholesale businesses 
we expect the merger to be immediately accretive to our earnings per share  excluding one time transaction costs 
the transaction will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and a billion commitment from bank of america  consisting of up to a billion senior secured term loan and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
on august   we deposited million into an escrow account 
the deposit was subsequently increased to million  since the closing of the transaction did not occur on or before november  if the merger has not been consummated by april   either giant or western may terminate the transaction unless their breach was the cause of the merger not being consummated by such date 
if the merger is terminated after this date and the hsr waiting period has not expired or been waived  western will forfeit this million deposit to giant 
following the closing of the transaction  paul foster will remain president and chief executive officer of western refining  and fred holliger  giant s current chairman and chief executive officer  will serve as a special advisor to our board of directors 
the combined company will be headquartered in el paso and will maintain offices in scottsdale  arizona 
process summary our refinery is a nominal  bpd cracking facility that has historically run wti crude oil to optimize the yields of higher value refined products  which currently account for over of our production output 
the existing metallurgy at our refinery  combined with our various refinery initiatives  will give us the flexibility to process significantly more west texas sour  or wts  crude oil  which is less expensive than wti crude oil 

table of contents the following table summarizes our refinery s major process unit capacities 
unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day  or bpsd  or operating day 
the process units are distinguished by their location in either the south refinery or north refinery  which are located approximately one quarter mile apart  however  the operations of the units are integrated as if a single refinery 
major process unit capacities barrels per stream day of crude oil process unit south refinery north refinery total capacity crude oil unit vacuum distillation unit fluid catalytic cracking unit ulsd hydrotreater naphtha hydrotreater catalytic reforming unit alkylation unit jet fuel merox unit jet fuel hydrotreater light ends recovery unit butamer unit sulfur recovery units lt d n m power supply electricity is supplied to our refinery by el paso electric company via two separate feeders to both the north and south sides of our refinery 
our refinery s operations can continue at percent of capacity with just one feeder in service to each side 
we have an electrical power curtailment plan to conserve power in the event of a partial outage 
in addition  we have multiple small  automatic starting emergency generators to supply electricity for essential lighting and controls as well as various uninterruptible power supply systems located at several units throughout our refinery to continue power supply to process computers and controls in the event of a power outage 
natural gas is supplied to our refinery via pipeline operated by oneok westex transmission  lp the transportation contract for this natural gas supply is on an interruptible tariff basis 
our refinery can also connect to the texas gas service natural gas distribution system as an alternate natural gas supply source if necessary 
we purchase our natural gas separately from the transportation at market rates 

table of contents raw material supply the primary inputs for our refinery consist of crude oil  iso butane and alkylate 
we currently have the capacity to process approximately  bpd of crude oil  of which approximately is wti crude oil 
we are currently pursuing several strategic initiatives that  once completed  may result in an increased future use of sour crude oil 
the following table describes the historical feedstocks for our refinery percentage for year ended year ended december  december  refinery feedstocks bpd crude oils west texas intermediate west texas sour total crude oil other feedstocks blendstocks intermediate inventory change iso butane normal butane alkylate toluene ethanol transmix total other feedstocks blendstocks total crude oil other feedstocks blendstocks crude oil supply pipeline crude oil is delivered to our refinery via a mile crude oil pipeline owned and operated by kinder morgan 
the system handles both sweet wti and sour wts crude oil 
the main trunkline into el paso is used solely for the supply of crude oil to us  on a published tariff 
our affiliate acquired the crude oil pipeline in from chevron corporation  or chevron 
in  our affiliate sold the crude oil pipeline to kinder morgan  and we simultaneously entered into a year crude oil transportation agreement with kinder morgan 
the crude oil pipeline has access to the majority of the producing fields in the permian basin  thereby providing us with access to a plentiful supply of wti and wts crude oil from fields with long reserve lives 
we generally buy our crude oil under contracts with various crude oil providers  including a contract with kinder morgan that expires in and shorter term contracts with other suppliers  at market based rates 
other feedstocks blendstocks external iso butane purchases supplement iso butane manufactured by us and are fed to our refinery s alkylation unit for the production of the gasoline blendstock alkylate 
normal butane can be characterized as either a feedstock or a refinery produced product depending on the time of year 
during the summer gasoline season  when gasoline specifications limit the amount of light material that can be blended into the pool  excess normal butane produced by our refinery is stored in caverns in new mexico 
in the winter season  as specifications allow  this material is returned to our refinery for gasoline blending 
in addition  we supplement our produced volumes with purchases of normal butane 

table of contents we have contracts in place for alkylate  which is purchased from the gulf coast and delivered via the magellan south system pipeline that terminates at our refinery 
the high octane and low volatility of alkylate make it a premium blendstock for phoenix cbg  a high value gasoline produced by our refinery 
our connection to the magellan south system pipeline allows us to purchase alkylate at a discount relative to competitors who receive it via rail from the gulf coast 
we purchase ethanol for seasonal blending with gasoline to meet the epa s oxygenated fuel mandate levels 
we purchase ethanol from the midwest region of the us and currently have contracts in place for the majority of our expected ethanol needs 
we receive ethanol via railcar deliveries to el paso  albuquerque  phoenix and tucson 
refined products pipelines outside of the el paso area  which is supplied via our product terminal  we provide refined products to other areas  including tucson  phoenix  albuquerque and juarez 
supply to these areas is achieved through pipeline systems that are linked to our refinery 
product distribution to arizona is delivered via the kinder morgan east line  which connects our refinery to product terminals in tucson and phoenix 
we also utilize two pipelines owned by plains to ship product the first originates at our refinery and terminates in albuquerque  and the second runs from el paso to juarez 
a final pipeline owned by kinder morgan provides diesel to the union pacific railway in el paso 
both kinder morgan s east line and the plains pipeline to albuquerque are interstate pipelines regulated by the ferc and currently operate near capacity year round 
the tariff provisions for these pipelines include prorating policies that grant historical shippers line space that is consistent with their prior activities as well as a prorated portion of any expansions  with only a small amount allocated to new shippers 
kinder morgan announced in that it had completed its expansion of the east line between el paso and tucson to approximately  bpd  and  bpd between tucson and phoenix 
kinder morgan also announced further expansion of the east line would be completed in this expansion will initially increase the capacity by another and provide the platform for further incremental expansions through horsepower additions to the system 
we intend to fully utilize our prorated allotment of the increased capacity to capitalize on the higher margins typically available in the phoenix and tucson areas 
customers and refined products we sell a variety of refined products to our diverse customer base 
those customers accounting for more than of our revenues in were chevron at  phoenix fuel at and pmi trading limited an affiliate of pemex  or pmi  at 
we have a five year offtake agreement with chevron that expires in august with certain renewal options 
our sales to phoenix fuel are pursuant to short term agreements at prices based on various market indices and our sales to pmi are pursuant to spot sales agreements at prices based on various market indices 
depending on market conditions and seasonal fluctuations  the yield of specific products may be increased to take advantage of pricing changes and to comply with various regulatory requirements 
we also purchase additional refined products from other refiners to supplement supply to our customers 
these products are the same grade as the products that we currently manufacture 
gasoline 
for  gasoline accounted for approximately of our refinery s production 
gasoline accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
we produce in excess of different specifications of gasoline over the course of a year to address seasonal requirements in each of the areas we serve 
we sell gasoline at our product marketing terminal to the el paso area and via pipeline to other areas  including phoenix  tucson  albuquerque and juarez 
the highest value gasoline produced at our refinery is typically premium phoenix cbg 
we also currently sell approximately  bpd of gasoline to a subsidiary of petroleos mexicanos  or pemex  the mexican state owned oil company  in juarez via a pipeline that originates at our refinery 
outside of our core service areas  we have exchange agreements for limited 
table of contents volumes with various companies under which we deliver gasoline on their behalf in areas that we serve  and they deliver product on our behalf in other locations 
diesel 
for  diesel fuel accounted for approximately of our refinery s production 
diesel accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
we produce ultra low sulfur and high sulfur diesel fuel 
ultra low sulfur diesel fuel is predominantly used for on road transportation purposes  such as long haul trucking and automobile travel 
in may  we brought our ultra low sulfur diesel unit on line and are currently producing in excess of  bpd through this unit 
high sulfur diesel fuel is sold for off road uses such as railroad transportation and mining 
we currently sell approximately  bpd of high sulfur diesel to the union pacific railroad via a pipeline that runs exclusively from our refinery to its fueling station approximately three miles away 
we also sell approximately  bpd of high sulfur diesel fuel to the burlington northern santa fe railway outside albuquerque via the plains pipeline 
see pipelines above 
jet fuel 
for  jet fuel accounted for approximately of our refinery s production 
jet fuel accounted for of our revenues in  and we currently sell jet fuel to the us federal government and to airlines operating at the el paso international airport 
residuum 
for  residuum accounted for approximately of our refinery s production 
we historically sold our residuum for use primarily as an asphalt blendstock to chevron under a supply agreement  which we terminated in december in may  we purchased an asphalt plant and terminals from chevron 
the asphalt plant is located in el paso adjacent to our refinery and is being used to process a portion of residuum production into finished asphalt products 
we are now selling our residuum to third parties at market based rates  or we process it further into finished asphalt at our plant 
refinery location southwest region a refinery s location can have an important impact on its refining margins because location can influence access to feedstocks and the efficient distribution of refined products 
there are five regions in the us called petroleum administration for defense districts  or padds 
for example  we deliver to the western portion of padd iii new mexico and west texas but not the gulf coast market in the eastern portion of padd iii 
we also deliver to the eastern portion of padd v arizona  which lacks refining capacity and relies upon pipelines from texas through el paso and the west coast market 
refined products to our destinations are supplied from the seven refineries in the southwest region as well as from refined product pipelines from outside this area  including the gulf coast and the west coast primarily los angeles  california 
refined product pricing in some of our destinations benefits from the supply constraints generally described above 
the phoenix and tucson areas  in particular  have a shortage of refining capacity and limited pipeline availability  which results in refineries serving these areas earning a premium on product sales compared to refineries serving other areas 
these constraints are anticipated to persist as the potential for increased supply from west coast refineries is limited by california s regulatory environment  projected california demand growth and high costs associated with capacity expansions 
pricing differences between phoenix  el paso and gulf coast regular and premium gasolines are shown in the following table in cents per gallon  or cpg regular gasoline gulf coast phoenix el paso price price price 
table of contents premium gasoline gulf coast phoenix el paso price price price source oil price information service opis average spot price 
average price for products sold at product marketing terminals in the location indicated 
average price for phoenix grade cbg gasoline 
competition we operate in the us southwest region  which includes the areas of west texas  new mexico and arizona 
refined products are supplied from this region s seven refineries as well as from refineries located in other regions  including the gulf coast and the west coast primarily los angeles  via interstate pipelines 
the southwest region has a total refining capacity of approximately  bpd 
petroleum refining and marketing is highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors affecting us are costs of crude oil and other feedstocks  refinery efficiency  refinery product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation 
we primarily compete with valero energy corp  conocophillips company  alon usa energy  inc  holly corporation and giant industries  inc  as well as refineries in other regions of the country that serve the regions we serve through pipelines 
because of their geographic diversity  larger and more complex refineries  integrated operations and greater resources  some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions  to compete on the basis of price  to obtain crude oil in times of shortage  and to bear the economic risk inherent in all phases of the refining industry 
the longhorn refined products pipeline  which was completed in late  runs approximately miles from the houston area of the gulf coast to el paso and has an estimated maximum capacity of  bpd 
this pipeline provides gulf coast refiners and other shippers with improved access to west texas and new mexico 
to date  we have not observed any material margin deterioration from the operation of the longhorn pipeline 
any additional supply provided by these pipelines or by the kinder morgan pipeline expansion could lower prices and increase price volatility in areas that we serve and could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
governmental regulation all of our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental and health and safety regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of petroleum and hazardous substances  the emission and discharge of materials into the environment  waste management  and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels 
our operations also require numerous permits and authorizations under various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in fines  penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits 
we have made  and will continue to make  significant capital and other expenditures related to environmental and health and safety compliance  including with respect to our air permits and the low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel regulations 
furthermore  we expect to make significant environmental capital expenditures in connection with the planned capacity expansion and upgrade of our refinery 
for additional details on capital expenditures related to regulatory requirements and our refinery capacity expansion and upgrade  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending 

table of contents periodically  we receive communications from various federal  state and local governmental authorities asserting violation s of environmental laws and or regulations 
these governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective action for these asserted violations 
we intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action 
we do not anticipate any such matters currently asserted will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
clean air act the epa has embarked on a petroleum refinery enforcement initiative initiative  whereby it is investigating industry wide noncompliance with certain clean air act rules 
the initiative has resulted in many refiners entering into consent decrees typically requiring substantial capital expenditures for additional air pollution control equipment and penalties 
since december  the company has been voluntarily discussing with the epa a settlement pursuant to the initiative 
negotiations with the epa regarding this initiative have focused exclusively on air emission programs 
the company does not expect these negotiations to result in any soil or groundwater remediation or clean up requirements 
while at this time it is not known precisely how the initiative or any resulting settlement may affect the company  the company expects to be required to pay penalties and to install additional pollution controls  and  as a result  its operating costs and capital expenditures may increase 
based on current negotiations and information  the company has estimated the total capital expenditures that may be required pursuant to the initiative would be approximately million 
these capital expenditures would primarily be for installation of a flare gas recovery system on the south side of our refinery and installation of nitrogen oxides  or nox  emission controls 
as of december   we had invested million on the flare gas recovery system with the remaining million budgeted to be spent in estimated expenditures for the nox emission controls project of million will occur from through these amounts have been included in the company s estimated capital expenditures for regulatory projects 
based on current information  the company does not expect any settlement pursuant to the initiative to have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations or that any penalties or increased operating costs related to the initiative will be material 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending regulatory projects 
reduction of sulfur content in light fuels the epa has adopted regulations under the clean air act that require significant reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline and diesel fuel 
these regulations required most refineries to begin reducing sulfur content in gasoline to parts per million  or ppm  in january   with full compliance by january   and require reductions in sulfur content in diesel to ppm beginning in june   with full compliance by january  however  we applied for and received small refiner status under the epa low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel programs 
a small refiner is one having less than  employees and an average crude oil capacity of less than  bpd 
as a small refiner  we do not have to meet the ppm gasoline standard until january since we fully implemented the new on road diesel sulfur content standard of ppm by june  if we lose our status as a small refiner  we would be required to incur capital expenditures for these gasoline and diesel standards at an earlier date 
upon the completion of the giant acquisition  we will no longer qualify as a small refiner 
the rules provide for a period of at least months to comply with the ppm gasoline standard after losing small refiner status due to such merger 
we anticipate meeting the standard in the required time 
our compliance with the new reduced sulfur standards in gasoline will require capital expenditures of million through our capital cost estimate for gasoline sulfur compliance has increased significantly from previous estimates due to enhanced scope definition for the fluid catalytic cracker  or fcc  gasoline hydrotreater  development and inclusion of costs related to the lsr hydrotreating unit  scope definition for offsites and infrastructure modifications needed to support gasoline sulfur compliance  project cost escalation and related 
table of contents cost contingencies 
for additional details  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital spending 
in addition to the benefits described above for being classified as a small refiner under the epa rules  we qualify for designation as a small refiner under tax legislation 
this legislation allows us to immediately deduct up to of the ultra low sulfur diesel compliance costs when incurred for tax purposes 
furthermore  the law allows the remaining of ultra low sulfur diesel compliance costs to be recovered as tax credits with the commencement of ultra low sulfur diesel manufacturing 
we estimate that approximately million of our capital expenditures will qualify for this accelerated deduction tax credit treatment 
the loss of our small refiner status upon the completion of the giant acquisition will not impact this accelerated deduction tax treatment 
environmental remediation certain environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up spills  releases and discharges of petroleum or hazardous substances  even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such spills  releases and discharges 
these environmental laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances  regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person 
the groundwater and certain solid waste management units and other areas at and adjacent to our refinery have been impacted by prior spills  releases and discharges of petroleum or hazardous substances and are currently undergoing remediation by us and chevron pursuant to certain agreed administrative orders with the texas commission on environmental quality  or tceq 
chevron retained liability for  and control of  certain environmental liabilities and remediation activities that existed  or arise out of events occurring  prior to our acquisition of the north refinery assets 
for example  chevron retained responsibility to remediate their solid waste management units in accordance with its resource conservation recovery act permit and retained liability for  and control of  certain groundwater remediation responsibilities 
we currently believe that we have adequate insurance to cover the costs of the remaining activities  however  to the extent that these indemnity and insurance obligations are not fulfilled  we may incur significant costs in connection with these clean ups 
furthermore  in the future we may be required to remediate pollution conditions at the refinery not addressed by the agreed administrative orders or to remediate newly discovered pollution conditions 
in addition to clean up costs  we may face liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances that we may have manufactured  used  handled or disposed of or that are located at or released from our refinery or otherwise related to our current or former operations 
we may also face liability for personal injury  property damage  natural resource damage or for clean up costs for the alleged migration of petroleum or hazardous substances from our refinery to adjacent and other nearby properties 
there have recently been various discussions of legislation which  if passed  could affect our financial condition and operations 
following the gulf coast hurricanes  there have been increasing legislative discussions about the need to increase us refining capacity and ease the regulatory restrictions that have limited the construction of new refineries and expansion of existing refineries in the us if such legislation is adopted  our costs of regulatory compliance could decrease and  as a result of new refinery construction and existing refinery expansion  competition in our industry may increase 
there has also been discussion about legislation to increase taxes or impose price controls on refined products  which  if adopted  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
employees as of december   we had employees 
of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  which expire in april we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory  and we have not suffered any work stoppages at our refinery as a result of labor disputes since we assumed operational control of the refinery in august 
table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec  you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business 
risk factors the price volatility of crude oil  other feedstocks  refined products and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
our earnings and cash flows from operations depend on the margin above fixed and variable expenses including the cost of refinery feedstocks  such as crude oil at which we are able to sell refined products 
refining margins historically have been volatile  and are likely to continue to be volatile  as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  other feedstocks  refined products and fuel and utility services 
in recent years  the prices of crude oil  other feedstocks and refined products have fluctuated substantially 
prices of crude oil  other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the supply of and demand for crude oil  other feedstocks  gasoline and other refined products 
such supply and demand are affected by  among other things changes in global and local economic conditions  demand for crude oil and refined products  especially in the us  china and india  worldwide political conditions  particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the middle east  west africa and latin america  the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the level of crude oil  feedstocks and refined products imported into the us  which can be impacted by accidents  interruptions in transportation  inclement weather or other events affecting producers and suppliers  us government regulations  utilization rates of us refineries  changes in fuel specifications required by environmental and other laws  particularly with respect to oxygenates and sulfur content  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to maintain oil price and production controls  development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels  pricing and other actions taken by competitors that impact the market  product pipeline capacity  including the longhorn pipeline  as well as kinder morgan s planned expansion of its east line  both of which could increase supply in our service areas and therefore reduce our margins  accidents  interruptions in transportation  inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our plants  machinery or equipment  or those of our suppliers or customers  and local factors  including market conditions  weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our service areas 
future volatility may have a negative effect on our results of operations to the extent that the margin between refined product prices and feedstock prices narrows 
the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
crude oil and refined products are commodities  therefore  we have no control over the changing 
table of contents market value of these inventories 
because our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation methodology  if the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our lifo cost  we would record a write down of inventory and a non cash charge to cost of products sold 
in addition  the volatility in costs of fuel  principally natural gas  and other utility services  principally electricity  used by our refinery affects operating costs 
fuel and utility prices have been  and will continue to be  affected by factors outside our control  such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we have a limited operating history as a stand alone company  and our previous financial statements may not be indicative of future performance 
fiscal year was the first full year in which we owned and operated our integrated refinery 
in light of our acquisition of the north refinery assets  our financial statements only reflect the impact of that acquisition since that date and therefore make comparisons with prior periods difficult 
as a result  our limited historical financial performance makes it difficult for shareholders to evaluate our business and results of operations to date and to assess our future prospects and viability 
furthermore  our brief operating history has resulted in revenue and profitability growth rates that may not be indicative of our future results of operations 
as a result  the price of our common stock may be volatile 
if the price of crude oil increases significantly or our credit profile changes  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refinery at full capacity 
we rely in part on borrowings and letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility  or revolving credit facility  to purchase crude oil for our refinery 
changes in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us or require additional support such as letters of credit 
due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases  any imposition by our creditors of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers  which could hinder our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refinery at full capacity 
in addition  if the price of crude oil increases significantly  we may not have sufficient capacity under our revolving credit facility  or sufficient cash on hand  to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refinery at full capacity 
a failure to operate our refinery at full capacity could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
the dangers inherent in our operations could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses  costs or liabilities 
we are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single refinery complex 
our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in refining operations and in transporting and storing crude oil  intermediate products and refined products 
these hazards and risks include  but are not limited to  the following natural disasters  fires  explosions  pipeline ruptures and spills  third party interference  disruption of natural gas deliveries under our interruptible natural gas delivery contract  
table of contents disruptions of electricity deliveries  and mechanical failure of equipment at our refinery or third party facilities 
any of the foregoing could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions  environmental pollution  personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others 
there is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in general and following unforeseen events 
furthermore  in such situations  undamaged refinery processing units may be dependent on or interact with damaged sections of our refinery and  accordingly  are also subject to being shut down 
our refinery consists of many processing units  several of which have been in operation for a long time 
one or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs  or our planned turnarounds may last longer than anticipated 
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues and increase our costs during the period of time that our units are not operating 
furthermore  any extended  non excused downtime of our refinery could cause us to lose line space on these refined product pipelines if we cannot otherwise utilize our pipeline allocations 
because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single refinery complex  any events described above could significantly disrupt our production and distribution of refined products  and any sustained disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could experience business interruptions caused by pipeline shutdown 
our refinery is dependent on a mile pipeline owned by kinder morgan  for the delivery of all of our crude oil 
because our crude oil refining capacity is approaching the delivery capacity of the pipeline  our ability to offset lost production due to disruptions in supply with increased future production is limited due to this crude oil supply constraint 
in addition  we will be unable to take advantage of further expansion of our refinery s production without securing additional crude oil supplies or pipeline expansion 
we also deliver a substantial percentage of our refined products through three principal product pipelines 
we could experience an interruption of supply or delivery  or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market  if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents  governmental regulation  terrorism  other third party action or any other events beyond our control 
our prolonged inability to receive crude oil or transport refined products on pipelines that we currently utilize could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  including hurricanes along the gulf coast  could interrupt the supply of some of our feedstocks 
our crude oil supplies come from the permian basin in texas and new mexico and therefore are generally not subject to interruption from severe weather  such as hurricanes 
however  we obtain certain of our feedstocks  such as alkylate  and some refined products we purchase for resale by pipeline from gulf coast refineries 
we rely on transported feedstocks to produce a portion of our phoenix cbg and other refined products 
in addition  we currently depend on rail shipments of sulfuric acid to and from acid regeneration facilities in louisiana to conduct our refining operations 
these gulf coast refineries and acid regeneration facilities are subject to damage or production interruption from hurricanes or other severe weather 
if our supply of feedstocks or sulfuric acid is interrupted  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
competition in the refining and marketing industry is intense  and an increase in competition in the areas in which we sell our refined products could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies  including certain multinational oil companies 
because of their geographic diversity  larger and more complex refineries  integrated operations and greater resources  some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions  to compete on the basis of price  to obtain crude oil in times of shortage and to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of the refining industry 
in addition  based on the strong fundamentals for the global refining 
table of contents industry  capital investments for refinery expansions and new refineries in international markets have increased  which may result in greater us imports of refined products 
we are not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks 
we do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products 
certain of our competitors  however  obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company owned production and have retail outlets 
competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets  with brand name recognition  are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations  and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 
in addition  we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors  both within and outside of our industry  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the longhorn refined products pipeline  which was completed in late  runs approximately miles from the houston area of the gulf coast to el paso and has an estimated maximum capacity of  bpd 
this pipeline provides gulf coast refiners and other shippers with improved access to west texas and new mexico 
in addition  kinder morgan announced in that it had completed its expansion of the east line between el paso and tucson to approximately  bpd  and  bpd between tucson and phoenix 
kinder morgan also announced further expansion of the east line would be completed in this expansion will initially increase the capacity by another and provide the platform for further incremental expansions through horsepower additions to the system 
any additional supply provided by these pipelines could lower prices and increase price volatility in areas that we serve and could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental and health and safety regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of petroleum and hazardous substances  the emission and discharge of materials into the environment  waste management and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may be subject to administrative  civil and criminal proceedings by governmental authorities  as well as civil proceedings by environmental groups and other entities and individuals 
a failure to comply  and any related proceedings  including lawsuits  could result in significant costs and liabilities  penalties  judgments against us or governmental or court orders that could alter  limit or stop our operations 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  increased governmental enforcement or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures 
many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent  and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time 
we are not able to predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations or changes in the ways that such laws or regulations are administered  interpreted or enforced 
the requirements to be met  as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements  continue to develop and change 
to the extent that the costs associated with meeting any of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate 
if we cannot generate cash flow or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and long term capital requirements  we may not be able to comply with certain environmental standards by the current epa mandated deadlines or pursue our business strategies  in which case our operations may not perform as well as we currently expect 
we have substantial short term and long term capital needs  including those for capital expenditures that we will make to comply with the low sulfur content specifications of the tier ii gasoline standards and on and off road diesel laws and regulations 
our short term working capital 
table of contents needs are primarily crude oil purchase requirements  which fluctuate with the pricing and sourcing of crude oil 
we also have significant long term needs for cash  including those to support our expansion and upgrade plans  as well as for regulatory compliance 
our operations involve environmental risks that could give rise to material liabilities 
our operations  and those of prior owners or operators of our properties  have previously resulted in spills  discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment  and such spills  discharges or releases could also happen in the future 
past or future spills related to any of our operations  including our refinery  product terminals or transportation of refined products or hazardous substances from those facilities  may give rise to liability including strict liability  or liability without fault  and cleanup responsibility to governmental entities or private parties under federal  state or local environmental laws  as well as under common law 
for example  we could be held strictly liable under the comprehensive environmental responsibility  compensation and liability act  or cercla  for contamination of properties that we currently own or operate and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or by products for use  treatment  storage or disposal  without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with law at the time 
our liability could also increase if other responsible parties  including prior owners or operators of our facilities  fail to complete their clean up obligations 
based on current information  we do not believe these liabilities are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  but in the event that new spills  discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances occur or are discovered or there are other changes in facts or in the level of contributions being made by other responsible parties  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances located at or released from our refinery or otherwise related to our current or former operations 
we may also face liability for personal injury  property damage  natural resource damage or for clean up costs for the alleged migration of contamination or other hazardous substances from our refinery to adjacent and other nearby properties 
we could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations 
our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations  including environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
these authorizations and permits are subject to revocation  renewal or modification and can require operational changes  which may involve significant costs  to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and or health and safety 
a violation of these authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines  criminal sanctions  permit revocations  injunctions and or refinery shutdowns 
in addition  major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or expensive upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
covenants and events of default in our debt instruments could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility contains negative and financial covenants and events of default that may limit our financial flexibility and ability to undertake certain types of transactions 
for instance  we are subject to negative covenants that restrict our activities  including restrictions on creating liens  engaging in mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  incurring additional indebtedness  providing guarantees  
table of contents engaging in different businesses  making investments  making certain dividend  debt and other restricted payments  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  and entering into certain contractual obligations 
we are also subject to financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy other financial tests 
if we fail to satisfy the covenants set forth in our revolving credit facility or another event of default occurs under this facility  the maturity of the loans could be accelerated or we could be prohibited from borrowing for our working capital needs and issuing letters of credit 
if the loans are accelerated and we do not have sufficient cash on hand to pay all amounts due  we could be required to sell assets  to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing 
refinancing may not be possible and additional financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot borrow or issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  we would need to seek additional financing  if available  or curtail our operations 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is limited by contractual restrictions and cash generated by operations 
we currently pay a quarterly dividend 
however  we are a holding company  and all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
consequently  we will rely on dividends or advances from our subsidiaries to fund our dividends 
the ability of western refining lp  our operating subsidiary  to pay dividends and our ability to receive distributions from that entity are subject to applicable local law and other restrictions including  but not limited to  restrictions in our revolving credit facility  including minimum operating cash and net worth requirements 
such laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to us which would restrict our ability to pay dividends 
in addition  our payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows 
our board of directors will review our dividend policy periodically in light of the factors referred to above  and we cannot assure you of the amount of dividends  if any  that may be paid in the future 
changes to the current tax laws could result in the imposition of entity level state taxation on our operating subsidiary  which would result in a reduction in our anticipated cash flow 
our operating subsidiary is organized as a partnership  which generally is not subject to entity level state franchise tax in the jurisdictions in which it is organized or operates 
however  current laws may change  subjecting our operating subsidiary to entity level state taxation 
for example  because of state budget deficits  in may  the state of texas enacted a new business tax that is imposed on our gross margin to replace the state s current franchise tax 
the new legislation s effective date is january   which means that our first texas margins tax tmt return will not become due until may   and will be based on our operations 
although the new tmt is imposed on an entity s gross margin rather than on its net income  certain aspects of the tax make it similar to an income tax 
therefore  we will account for the new tmt as an income tax 
the impact of the tmt is expected to increase our effective tax rate by up to 
our insurance policies do not cover all losses  costs or liabilities that we may experience 
our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses  costs or liabilities 
our business interruption insurance coverage does not apply unless a business interruption exceeds days and the loss exceeds million 
we could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of our existing insurance coverage 
our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies 
our business strategies include the implementation of several capital expenditure projects designed to increase the productivity and profitability of our refinery 
many factors beyond our control may prevent or hinder our implementation of some or all of our planned capital expenditure projects or lead to cost overruns  including new or more expensive obligations to comply with environmental regulations  a downturn in refining margins  technical or mechanical problems  lack of available capital and other factors 
failure to successfully implement these profit enhancing strategies on a timely basis or at all may adversely affect our business prospects and competitive position in the industry 
in addition  a component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary assets for our refinery in order to increase earnings and cash flow 
our ability to do so will be dependent upon several factors  including our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates  consummate acquisitions on favorable terms  successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control 
risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to diversion of management time and attention from our existing business  challenges in managing the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of operations  difficulties in integrating the financial  technological and management standards  processes  procedures and controls of an acquired business with those of our existing operations  liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance  greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results  difficulties in achieving anticipated operational improvements  incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets  and issuance of additional equity  which could result in further dilution of the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
we may not be successful in acquiring additional assets  and any acquisitions that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have adverse effects on our business and operating results 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our ability to manage our business and continue our growth could be negatively impacted 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  executive vice president  executive vice president refining  chief administrative officer and assistant secretary  chief financial officer and treasurer and vice president legal  secretary and general counsel 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any member of our senior management team 
the loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us 
we face competition for these professionals from our competitors  our customers and other companies operating in our industry 
to the extent that the services of members of our senior management team would be unavailable to us for any reason  we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company 
we may not be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms  or at all 
a substantial portion of our refining workforce is unionized  and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations 
as of december   we employed people  of whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
the collective bargaining agreement expires in april we may not be able to 
table of contents renegotiate our collective bargaining agreement on satisfactory terms  or at all 
a failure to do so may increase our costs 
in addition  our existing labor agreement may not prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future  and any such work stoppage could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks  threats of war or actual war may negatively affect our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
terrorist attacks in the us and the war in iraq  as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them  may adversely affect our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
energy related assets which could include refineries and terminals such as ours or pipelines such as the ones on which we depend for our crude oil supply and refined product distribution may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets 
a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  any terrorist attack could have an adverse impact on energy prices  including prices for our crude oil and refined products  and an adverse impact on the margins from our refining and marketing operations 
in addition  disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls 
while we currently maintain insurance that provides coverage against terrorist attacks  such insurance has become increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain 
as a result  insurance providers may not continue to offer this coverage to us on terms that we consider affordable  or at all 
our operating results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic 
in addition  oxygenate is added to the gasoline in our service areas during the winter months  thereby increasing the total supply of gasoline 
this combination of decreased demand and increased supply during the winter months can lower prices in the winter months 
we also schedule refinery downtime for maintenance and repairs during the winter months 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
in addition to the overall seasonality of our business  unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the areas that use heating oil could have the effect of reducing demand for heating oil  which could result in lower prices for diesel in our service areas and reduce operating margins 
three of our customers each account for more than of our refined product sales  and the complete loss of any of them may have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
in  chevron  phoenix fuel and pmi accounted for  and of our refined product sales  respectively 
we have a five year offtake agreement with chevron that expires in august with certain renewal options 
our sales to phoenix fuel are pursuant to short term agreements at prices based on various market indices and our sales to pmi are pursuant to spot sales agreements at prices based on various market indices 
if we were to lose all  or substantially all  of these sales and be unable to replace them with other sales at market rates  it would have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
competition in the refining and marketing business is intense 
to the extent surplus supplies of refined products become available  it would likely enhance the competition for these customers 
we will be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are in the process of evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to audit  our internal controls over financial reporting 
we will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are required to comply with section as of december  however  we cannot be certain 
table of contents as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations 
furthermore  upon completion of this process  we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable sec and public company accounting oversight board rules and regulations that remain unremediated 
we are required to report  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that  or that are reasonably likely to  materially affect internal controls over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
if we fail to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the new york stock exchange  or nyse 
in addition  failure to comply with section or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements  and our stock price may be adversely affected as a result 
if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  we may face restricted access to the capital markets  and our stock price may be adversely affected 
our controlling stockholders may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders in the future 
mr 
paul foster  our president and chief executive officer  and messrs 
jeff stevens  ralph schmidt and scott weaver  our executive vice president  former chief operating officer and current director  and chief administrative officer and assistant secretary  respectively  own approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
foster and the other members of this management group will be able to control the election of our directors  determine our corporate and management policies and determine  without the consent of our other stockholders  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
so long as this group continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions  including whether to pursue or consummate potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of mr 
foster and the other members of this management group may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock 
we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nyse rules and  as a result  will qualify for  and may rely on  exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
under these rules  a company of which more than of the voting power is held by an individual  a group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nyse  including the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors  the requirement that we have a nominating corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities  and the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities 
we presently do not have a majority of independent directors on our board and are relying on the exemptions from the nyse corporate governance requirements set forth in the first bullet point above 
accordingly  you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 
our pending acquisition of giant industries  inc may not be successful and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from this acquisition 
we may be unable to obtain the governmental and regulatory approvals necessary in order to consummate the giant acquisition 
even if we do obtain these approvals  and even if the other conditions to the 
table of contents consummation of the giant acquisition are satisfied  our acquisition of giant may pose certain risks to our business 
giant has suffered three fires at its refineries in the past year  and as a result  their insurance costs have increased and the terms of their insurance coverage have been adversely affected 
giant has also suffered increased costs associated with several major capital projects 
in addition to the risks ordinarily associated with a significant merger acquisition  we will also be exposed to risks arising from these events and other operational risks that may affect giant differently than they currently affect us 
although we expect to realize strategic  operational and financial benefits as a result of the giant acquisition  we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved 
in particular  the success of the giant acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated refinery efficiencies and cost savings from assuming the control of giant s businesses 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations related to the giant acquisition and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our future indebtedness 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  we may be required to sell assets  to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing 
such refinancing might not be possible and additional financing might not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  we will face certain challenges as we work to integrate giant s operations into our business 
in particular  the giant acquisition will significantly expand our geographic scope  the types of business in which we are engaged  the number of our employees and the number of refineries we operate  thereby presenting us with significant challenges as we work to manage the substantial increases in scale resulting from the acquisition 
we must integrate a large number of systems  both operational and administrative 
delays in this process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  expenses  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  events outside of our control  including changes in state and federal regulation and laws as well as economic trends  also could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the giant acquisition 
we can give no assurance that our acquisition of giant will perform in accordance with our expectations 
despite our due diligence efforts  we must necessarily base any assessment of giant on inexact and incomplete information and assumptions with respect to operations  profitability and other matters that may prove to be incorrect 
we can give no assurance that our expectations with regards to integration and synergies will materialize 
our failure to successfully integrate and operate giant  and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  could adversely affect our operating  performing and financial results 
additionally  on november   timothy bisset filed a class action complaint in arizona state court against giant  its directors and us in connection with the merger 
mr 
bisset alleges that giant and its directors breached their fiduciary duty in voting to amend the definitive merger agreement to provide for  among other things  a lower acquisition price of per share 
mr 
bisset also alleges that we aided and abetted this breach of fiduciary duty 
he also alleges that he and other public stockholders of giant s common stock are entitled to enjoin the proposed amended transaction or  alternatively  to recover damages in the event the transaction is completed
