item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling and burn in related equipment and thermal sub systems for the global semiconductor industry 
this business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors  which in turn are dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors that are subject to significant cyclical trends in demand 
changes in the semiconductor  electronics  computer and telecommunications industries  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our businesses 
our orders during were strong  particularly in view of challenging industry wide conditions for back end semiconductor equipment 
however  our orders for semiconductor equipment declined in the fourth quarter and the near term outlook is uncertain 
during there was a decrease in demand for our advanced thermal handlers that was offset by an increase in orders for our high speed test handlers and burn in related and thermal sub system products 
as a result of this shift in product mix  increased customer support costs and other factors described herein  our gross margin declined during if this shift in product mix continues  our future gross margin percentage will be negatively impacted 
we will continue to focus on reducing product costs and overall spending  while we develop new product offerings for the test handler and burn in markets 
our deferred revenue totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in deferred revenue is primarily the result of the recognition of approximately million in revenue associated with our microwave communications contract with the uae that was accepted and paid during the third quarter of the deferred revenue amounts recognized were partially offset by additional deferrals of semiconductor equipment product sales  including thermal sub systems used in burn in equipment acquired from kryotech  inc  which as of december  are still awaiting customer acceptance 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  approximately million in and were primarily the result of decreases in customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix 
exposure related to inventories is common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins on certain products and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our other operating costs consist of research and development r d and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
both r d and sg a expense increased in  due primarily to our purchase of the unigen business  increased headcount  increased business volume  investment in product development programs and share based compensation 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our revenues during the last three years 
during  results improved in our microwave communications business 
our financial condition is strong with significant cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
during the three year period ended december   total cash and investments increased from million at december  to million at december  our management team uses several performance metrics to manage our various businesses 
these metrics  which tend to focus on near term forecasts due to the limited order backlog in our businesses  include i order bookings and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and related excess exposures typically based on the next twelve month s forecast  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends  iv industry data and trends noted in various publicly available sources  and v competitive factors and information 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future operating results or cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  that are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab no 
requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
during fiscal  we began recognizing share based compensation  under statement no 
r  for all awards granted in fiscal and for the unvested portion of previous award grants based on each award s grant date fair value 
we implemented statement no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method our financial statements and related information presented  pertaining to periods prior to our adoption of statement no 
r  have not been adjusted to reflect the fair value of share based compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of each share based award on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
to facilitate our adoption of statement no 
r  we applied the provisions of sab no 
in developing our methodologies to estimate our black scholes model inputs for certain options granted in option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividends are based primarily on historical factors related to our common stock 
expected volatility is based on historic  weekly stock price observations of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term 
we believe that historical volatility is the best estimate of future volatility 
due to a limited amount of historical option exercise data related to options with a five year contractual term  we adopted sab no 
s simplified method for estimating the expected term of share based awards granted during the first six months of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal we granted options with a ten year contractual term and utilized historical option exercise data for estimating the expected life of those awards 
statement no 
r also requires that estimated forfeitures be included as a part of the grant date estimate 
we used historical data to estimate expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 
prior to our adoption of statement no 
r  we reduced pro forma share based compensation expense  presented in the notes to our financial statements  for actual forfeitures as they occurred 
at december   excluding a reduction for forfeitures  we had approximately million and million of pre tax unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  respectively 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 

table of contents accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  increases to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes we estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
we must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  with a valuation allowance of million for state tax credit and loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 
 and we concluded there was no impairment loss 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

statement no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of october st of each year 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test in fiscal and contingencies we are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  statement no 
we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in statement no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt fin effective the beginning of fiscal we are currently assessing the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  statement no 

this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
statement no 
applies 
table of contents under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except statement no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of statement no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the three year period 
net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative gain on sale of facilities income from operations in may   we sold our metal detection equipment business  frl 
subsequent to the sale  the operating results of frl are being presented as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been reclassified accordingly 
unless otherwise indicated  the discussion and amounts provided in the results of operations section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k relate to continuing operations only 
compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor equipment in increased from the comparable period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in the primary reasons for the increase in sales of our semiconductor equipment business were increased sales of our high speed test handlers and a burn in system acquired in the unigen transaction 
semiconductor equipment was a lower percentage of consolidated sales in primarily as a result of the recognition of million in revenue from our contract with the uae for microwave communications equipment 
sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the same period in the primary reason for the increase in sales of our television camera business was increased demand for board level cameras from original equipment manufacturers and increased demand for closed circuit security cameras 
sales of microwave equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the increase in sales of our microwave communications business was primarily attributable to the recognition of approximately million in revenue associated with our contract with the uae which was accepted and paid and increased demand for our other products during gross margin our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communications businesses 
during  high speed test handlers accounted for a greater percentage of revenue than in fiscal our high speed test handlers have significantly lower gross margins than our advanced thermal test handlers 
additionally  during we recognized million in revenue for a burn in system  acquired from unisys  which generated a gross margin of approximately 
our consolidated gross margin was also negatively impacted when our microwave communications business recognized approximately million in revenue associated with its contract with the uae which generated a gross margin of approximately 
the remaining revenue of million and associated profit under this contract will be recognized upon completion of the two year warranty period and release from our obligation under a standby letter of credit 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 

table of contents our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues and in higher warranty costs associated with certain test handlers 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
approximately million of the charge recorded during was the result of a decline in customer forecasts for a burn in system  acquired from unisys 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
research and development expense r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal higher r d expense in was primarily a result of increased engineering headcount and overhead costs as a result of our unigen acquisition and labor and material costs for new product development within our semiconductor equipment business 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily related to increased business volume  and recognition of deferred costs associated with our microwave communications contract with the uae 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from higher interest rates and an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances in income taxes the provision for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  is less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  export sales benefits and the domestic manufacturing deduction offset by the effect of statement no 
r that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the tax provision for the year ended december  includes a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately million 
other factors that reduced our effective tax rate below the us federal statutory rate included tax credits  export sales benefits and the reversal of approximately million in accrued income taxes related to a tax examination completed in march realization of our deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of all available evidence  including such factors as our recent earnings history and expected future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the majority of these assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions or other factors not currently known or anticipated 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  statement no 
 net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and million was provided on deferred tax assets at december  and december   respectively  for state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards that  in the opinion of management  are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 

table of contents the reductions to the valuation allowance in and were the result of our improved profitability and the corresponding increase in the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable 
we have derived significant tax benefits from export sales 
as a result of the american jobs creation act of  the export sales benefit derived from the extraterritorial income exclusion eti was repealed subject to a phase out  that limits the full tax benefit to in  in and no benefit in and subsequent years 
the eti benefit was replaced with a deduction for domestic manufacturing activities subject to a phase in beginning in the future tax benefits we derive from the domestic manufacturing deduction will likely be less than those from eti 
the federal research credit expired on december  however  on december  the credit was extended by congress for two years and made fully retroactive to january  and the effect of the credit has been reflected in our tax provision 
other items in may   we sold the land and building previously used by our operations in littleton  massachusetts 
the property was sold for million in cash  less related costs  resulting in a net pre tax gain of approximately million which was recognized in in may   we sold substantially all the assets of our metal detection equipment business  frl 
the disposition resulted in a loss of approximately million which was recorded during as a result of the factors set forth above  our income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in our net income was million in  compared to million in compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while sales of microwave equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the comparable period in the primary reason for the increase in sales of our semiconductor equipment business  during  was strong customer demand for our advanced thermal semiconductor test handlers and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for our high speed test handlers 
during the net sales of our semiconductor equipment business benefited from the elimination of a million liability for customer sales credits that expired 
there were no sales credits eliminated during the decrease in sales experienced by our television camera business was primarily attributable to a decline in customer demand for our board level cameras partially offset by an increase in demand for our traffic and security cameras 
the increase in the sales of our microwave communications business was primarily attributable to new product offerings  increased demand from law enforcement agencies and the result of the timing of revenue recognition pursuant to accounting rules 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment business 
within the semiconductor equipment segment  margins decreased slightly in  primarily as a result of start up costs associated with the kryotech acquisition  selling price reductions on certain equipment  and increased overhead costs 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
in  we recorded a charge to cost of sales of approximately million as a result of inventory market valuation writedowns 
during  we sold certain of this inventory and our gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately million 
there were no sales of this inventory during 
table of contents research and development expense r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of higher r d labor and material costs for product development in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communication businesses  offset by a minor decrease in expenditures in our television camera business 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily related to increased business volume including increases in headcount  sales commissions  bad debt expense and incentive compensation 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and an increase in interest rates 
income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes in and  is lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  tax credits  export sales benefits and in the reversal of approximately million in accrued income taxes related to a tax examination completed in march as a result of the factors set forth above  our income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in our net income was million in  compared to million in liquidity and capital resources our business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and volatile 
we have in the past implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount and reduced spending 
the cyclical and volatile nature of our industry makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows difficult 
our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by operations 
while we maintain a credit facility  we have not used this as a source of cash and do not intend to do so 
we use cash to fund growth in our operating assets  including accounts receivable and inventory  and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development 

table of contents liquidity working capital the following summarizes our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital percentage in thousands increase change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital cash flows operating activities our net cash flows provided from operating activities in totaled million 
the major components of cash flows provided by operating activities were net income of million  and the loss from discontinued operations of million  depreciation and amortization of million  non cash share based compensation expense of million  deferred income taxes of million  tax benefits from stock options exercised of million  and other changes in net current assets 
the change in current assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the timing of cash collections and the increase in inventory was  in part  attributable to inventory acquired for new products related to the unigen transaction and to meet customer demand for our products 
investing activities our net cash used for investing activities in totaled million and was primarily the result of million cash used for purchases of short term investments  partially offset by million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments 
our other expenditures in include the purchase of unigen assets for million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the acquisition of the unigen assets was a strategic transaction to strengthen the portfolio of thermal products  patents and other intellectual property within our semiconductor equipment business 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in our semiconductor equipment business and consisted primarily of equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and related functions 
investing activities also included cash received in the amount of million from the sale of our facility in littleton  massachusetts and million from the sale of our metal detection equipment business  frl 
financing activities our net cash provided from financing activities included million received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options  and the tax benefits from stock options exercised of million  offset by million for the payment of dividends 
capital resources in june  we renewed our million unsecured bank line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit will expire in july   and requires that we maintain specified minimum levels of net worth  limits the amount of our capital expenditures and requires us to meet certain other financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding at december   however  approximately million of the credit facility was allocated to standby letters of credit at december   leaving the balance of million available for future borrowings 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  
table of contents fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
no liability has been recorded in connection with these arrangements beyond those required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
