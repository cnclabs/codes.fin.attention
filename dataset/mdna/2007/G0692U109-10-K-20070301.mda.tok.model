item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
for an overview of our business including information on segments and individual lines of business refer to item of this report 
results of operations years ended december   and overview we believe the following financial indicators are important in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for our common shareholders return on average common equity diluted book value per common share cash dividends per common share return on average common equity roace represents the level of net income available to common shareholders generated from the average of the opening and closing common shareholders equity during the period 
our objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward our shareholders for the risks assumed by the company and to grow revenue only when we deem the returns meet or exceed our requirements 
diluted book value per common share is a non gaap financial measure  for further information refer to non gaap financial measures at the end of item we consider diluted book value per common share an appropriate measure of our returns to common shareholders  as we believe growth in our book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth of our stock price 
our dividend policy is an integral part of the value we create for our shareholders 
the board of directors reviews our dividend policy on a regular basis and has increased the annual dividend in each of the last three years 
the changes in roace and diluted book value per common share in the last three years have correlated with movements in our net income available to common shareholders 
the following table breaks out net income into three components  underwriting income loss  investment income and net realized gains losses  and other revenues and expenses 
underwriting income on a segment basis is a measure of underwriting profitability that takes into account net premiums earned and other insurance related income as revenue and net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and underwriting related general and administrative costs as expenses 
underwriting income is the difference between these revenue and expense items 
because our investment portfolio is managed on a total return basis we have reviewed investment income and net realized gains losses together 
other revenues and expenses represent corporate expenses  foreign exchange gains losses  interest expense and income tax expense  these have been condensed in the table below but are reviewed individually in the discussion following 
year ended december in thousands underwriting income loss global insurance us insurance reinsurance investment income and net realized gains losses other revenues and expenses net income preferred share dividends net income available to common shareholders our underwriting results have significantly impacted the level of net income in the last three years following losses incurred from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma in  and hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne in in  there was an absence of significant catastrophes and therefore our underwriting income was substantially higher 
investment income has grown over the last three years due to a combination of a larger investment base and higher yields and increased income from our allocation to other investments 
underwriting results premiums gross and net premiums written and earned in our insurance and reinsurance segments in the years ended december were as follows gross written earned written earned written earned in thousands global insurance us insurance insurance total reinsuance total net written earned written earned written earned in thousands global insurance us insurance insurance total reinsuance total changes in net premiums earned reflect period to period changes in net premiums written and business mix  together with normal variability in earning patterns 
the increase in net premiums written in each of the last two years reflects the continued growth of our global underwriting platform since our inception five years ago 
our underwriting objective is to achieve both profitability and diversity in our portfolio  not simply total premium growth  and in the last three years we have balanced our organic growth and expansions with disciplined underwriting in the face of competitive pricing pressures 
refer to item  our business strategy for further discussion 
for a detailed account of the movements above refer to the segments discussion below 
loss ratio the table below shows the components of our net loss and loss expense ratio loss ratio year ended december current year  before hurricane losses hurricane losses net favorable prior period development loss ratio although major losses are an inevitable part of our business  the hurricane losses in and had such a significant impact that we have highlighted them separately above 
the prior period reserve development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse developments  primarily on our short tail lines of business 
in it included percentage points of reserve strengthening in relation to hurricane katrina  rita and wilma 
while we believe that our loss reserves at december  are adequate  new information may lead to future developments in ultimate loss and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserves currently provided 
in addition  conditions and trends that affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is inappropriate to anticipate future redundancies and deficiencies based on historical experience 
our loss ratio also fluctuates from year to year depending on a number of other variables that include the level of estimated attritional losses  changes in our mix of business and changes in pricing and other assumptions used to establish our loss ratios 
in  the company began to incorporate its own specific loss information in establishing initial loss ratios on certain short tail lines of business 
acquisition cost ratio our acquisition costs ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
acquisition costs relate to the commissions  taxes and other fees paid to obtain business offset by commissions received on ceded premiums 
typically  our acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary by each line of business that we underwrite 
historically  our acquisition costs have included incentive commission costs however we discontinued such arrangements with brokers at the end of incentive commissions represented percentage points of our acquisition cost ratio 
our ratio otherwise increased in compared to reflecting an increase in the relative share of net premiums earned generated by our reinsurance segment see above where acquisition costs are higher than our insurance segment 
the share of reinsurance business stabilized during and the increase in the ratio in as compared to was largely due to business mix changes in our u 
s insurance sub segment 
investment income and net realized investment gains losses our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity 
additionally we invest our portfolio with a focus on total return rather than establishing yield or income targets 
the following table provides a breakdown of investment income  net realized investment gains losses and also the associated yields and returns year ended december in thousands interest income on fixed maturity investments interest income on cash and cash equivalents changes in fair values of other investments investment expense net investment income net realized losses gains on fixed maturity investments changes in fair values of investment derivatives net realized investment losses gains net investment income and net realized investment losses gains annualized effective yield of invested assets total return of invested assets total return of cash and investments invested assets represent assets managed by external investment managers 
net investment income net investment income increased in over and in over the growth from period to period is a result of a combination of a larger investment base  higher investment yields and increased income from our allocation to other investments 
our average investment base increased substantially to billion in from billion in and from billion in due to positive operating cash flow and capital raising activity in the growth in the annualized effective yield was primarily due to higher us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve 
as an example  the yield on the year us treasury increased from a yield at december  to at december  and at december  the yield on our portfolio may vary significantly from period to period due primarily to the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
increased income from our other investment portfolio is a result of larger allocations combined with better total returns in from those investments 
net realized investment losses gains the majority of our portfolio is invested in the fixed income market and as a result the level of realized gains and losses on these investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of increasing interest rates throughout and negatively impacted the price of fixed income resulting in larger unrealized loss positions and consequently  portfolio turnover caused increased realized losses 
additionally  we recognized realized losses of million and nil from securities that were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
total return our portfolio is managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include net investment income  net realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by our investment portfolio 
the increase in our total return between and was due to a growing allocation to the higher returning other investments and more significantly an increase in short and intermediate us interest rates which stemmed from the increases in the federal funds rate which began in the mid part of and continued in and despite the steady increase in yield over this period  the magnitude of the rate increases in had such a negative impact on the fair value of the fixed income portfolio that the realized losses and unrealized losses more than offset the increase in yield in that year 
other revenues and expense items the following table sets forth our other revenues and expenses year ended december in thousands corporate expenses foreign exchange gains losses interest expense income tax expense corporate expenses our corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
as a percentage of net premiums earned  corporate expenses were  and for  and respectively 
the movement largely reflects changes in our incentive compensation costs which are tied to our operating results 
foreign exchange gains losses our reporting currency is the us dollar  however  some of our business is written in other currencies 
the gains in and were principally made on the revaluation of asset balances denominated in sterling and euro following an appreciation of sterling and the euro against the us dollar  whereas these currencies depreciated against the u 
s dollar in resulting in an exchange loss 
interest expense interest expense primarily consists of interest due on our senior notes that we issued in november  which bear interest at 
in december   we entered into a million repurchase agreement that we anticipate renewing throughout the repurchase agreement bears interest at a rate of month libor plus per annum and therefore we anticipate interest costs to increase significantly during for further detail refer to liability under repurchase agreement in the commitments and contingencies section  below 
income tax expense income tax expense is generated primarily through our foreign operations in the united states and europe 
income tax expense increased over the three year period as the foreign operations contribution to income before tax increased 
our effective tax rate on net income  which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax  was for compared with in and in the company s effective tax rate was higher in than or due to the substantial reduction in the company s income before tax due to hurricane losses 
changes in our geographic mix of earnings also impact income tax expense and effective tax rate 
underwriting results by segment years ended december   and our business consists of two underwriting segments insurance and reinsurance 
our insurance segment is further divided into two sub segments global insurance and us insurance 
insurance segment overview results of our insurance segment were as follows year ended december in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned other insurance related income loss expenses net losses and loss expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income ratios loss ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio the mix of business in our insurance segment has evolved over the last three years in response to market conditions and opportunities 
we have significantly reduced our participation on aviation and aviation war business since due to pricing pressures  however  growth in professional lines and political risk business mitigated the decline in total premium in the segment 
our loss ratio in included percentage points of net losses incurred relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma while our loss ratio included percentage points relating to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
in there was an absence of major catastrophes and therefore our reported loss ratio was significantly lower 
our underwriting results have also been significantly impacted by development on prior year net loss reserves 
in  we experienced net favorable prior year development of percentage points compared to percentage points and percentage points in and  respectively 
outlook generally  we are satisfied that the broad property and casualty insurance marketplace  provides us ample opportunity to target attractively priced risks 
current rate levels for some lines of business  like catastrophe exposed property and energy business  continue to produce returns above historic levels 
in areas where the competition has been much more aggressive  such as terrorism and aviation  we are maintaining a conservative posture 
other lines  such as primary casualty  umbrella  and professional lines  still contain good profit potential  but bear closer scrutiny 
smaller accounts are experiencing less pricing pressure and we continue to develop our capabilities for efficiently accessing and underwriting these accounts 
the following is a discussion of the underwriting results within our global and us insurance sub segments global insurance sub segment results of our global insurance sub segment were as follows year ended december in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written gross premiums earned net premiums earned other insurance related loss income expenses net losses and loss expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income ratios loss ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio gross premiums written the following table provides gross premiums written by line of business year ended december in thousands property marine terrorism and war risk aviation and aerospace political risk professional lines and other specialty total several premium trends that characterized continued into we continued to reduce our participation on terrorism and war risk and aviation and aerospace lines due to pricing considerably below our threshold for this business 
simultaneously  we grew our professional lines with the addition of a london market based underwriting team in early and the acquisition of a large specialty program in mid while total gross premiums written decreased in over  we experienced an increase of in over due to several factors 
during  the property and offshore energy markets were characterized by strong competition  particularly on non us exposures  with pricing pressure leading to reductions in our renewal participation 
however  this trend reversed in for natural perils exposed property and offshore energy risks in the us and gulf of mexico where significant rate increases were implemented following the hurricane losses 
growth in these lines would have been greater had it not been for initiatives to reduce our natural peril catastrophe exposure 
in  we grew our political risk business through a combination of an additional underwriting resource and new market opportunities 
ceded premiums the percentage of premiums ceded in our global insurance sub segment varies depending on our analysis of the relative attractiveness of reinsurance buying opportunities 
premiums ceded as a percentage of gross premiums written was  and in  and  respectively 
the significant increase in ceded premiums in was largely due to higher reinstatement premiums following our utilization of reinsurance protections on hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
in  there were few attractive reinsurance buying opportunities and we concentrated on reducing our gross exposures in order to mitigate volatility in our portfolio 
net premiums earned the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business year ended december in thousands property marine terrorism and war risk aviation and aerospace political risk professional lines and other specialty total between and net premiums earned decreased by despite an increase in net premiums written of 
this partially relates to the significant reduction in aviation and aviation war premium since this business is primarily renewed in the fourth quarter 
consequently  includes the earn out of significantly more aviation and aviation war premium from the underwriting year than was earned in from the underwriting year 
in assessing net premiums earned  another significant consideration relates to our political risk book 
this line typically provides multi year insurance coverage and therefore the premium is earned over a number of years 
less than of premiums written in were earned in this was also due to the fact that a significant amount of premiums were written in the last quarter 
loss ratio the table below shows the components of our loss ratio year ended december in thousands current year  before hurricane losses hurricane losses prior period net favorable development loss ratio although major losses are an inevitable part of our business  the hurricane losses in and had such a significant impact that we have highlighted them separately above 
the prior period reserve development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse developments  primarily on our short tail lines of business 
in it included percentage points of reserve strengthening in relation to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our loss ratio also fluctuates year on year depending on a number of variables that include the volume of estimated attritional losses  changes in mix of business and changes in pricing and other assumptions used to establish our loss ratios 
in  the company began to incorporate its own specific loss information in establishing initial net loss ratios on certain short tail lines of business 
acquisition costs incentive commission costs accounted for percentage points of our acquisition cost ratio however we discontinued such arrangements at the end of that year 
our acquisition cost ratio has otherwise increased in each of the last two years reflecting changes in our mix of business 
u 
s insurance results of our us insurance sub segment were as follows year ended december in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written gross premiums earned net premiums earned other insurance related income expenses net losses and loss expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income loss ratios loss ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio gross premiums written the following table provides gross premiums written by line of business year ended december in thousands property professional lines liability other specialty total in we were able to consolidate  build and strengthen the market position we had established by the end of the majority of growth in was driven by significant rate increases in our natural peril exposed property catastrophe business following the hurricane losses 
this was achieved while substantially reducing our natural peril aggregate exposures 
the premium trends that characterized continued into these included growth of custom accounts in our property line of business  writing additional errors and omissions insurance in our professional lines book having appointed a managing general underwriter effective january   expanding our umbrella and excess liability business  and growing our employer stop loss business in our other specialty account 
despite the aforementioned increase in umbrella and excess premiums  growth in our liability book was tempered during by a reduction in excess and surplus primary business due to a more competitive market 
ceded premiums premiums ceded as a percentage of gross premiums written was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of premiums ceded in was largely due to higher reinstatement premiums following our utilization of reinsurance protections on hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the ratio was also impacted by business mix  a higher percentage of earned premiums were derived from our errors and omissions book which has a low ceding percentage 
net premiums earned the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business year ended december in thousands property professional lines liability other specialty total changes in net premiums earned reflect period to period changes in net premiums written and business mix  together with normal variability in earning patterns 
the increase in net premiums earned in each of the last two years reflects growth in our net premiums written 
changes in mix of business over this period have not significantly impacted this trend 
loss ratio the table below shows the components of our loss ratio year ended december current year  before hurricane losses hurricane losses net favorable prior period development loss ratio although major losses are an inevitable part of our business  the hurricane losses in and had such a significant impact that we have highlighted them separately above 
net favorable development in each of the last three years has been driven by lower than expected frequency and severity on our property accounts 
in  approximately of the net favorable development related to the accident year 
our loss ratio also fluctuates year on year depending on a number of other variables that include the level of estimated attritional losses  changes in our business mix and changes in pricing and other assumptions used to establish our loss ratios 
acquisition costs incentive commission costs accounted for percentage points of our acquisition cost ratio  however  we discontinued such arrangements at the end of that year 
our ratio has otherwise increased in each of the last two years reflecting the growing share of business generated by managing general underwriters within our professional lines book 
this business generally has higher gross acquisition costs than the rest of the book and a significant portion of it does not have an override commission associated with reinsurance coverage 
reinsurance segment results in our reinsurance segment were as follows year ended december in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written gross premiums earned net premiums earned other insurance related income expenses net losses and loss expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income loss ratios loss and loss expenses ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio the increase in underwriting income in reflects an absence of major catastrophe losses compared to and the book of business underlying our results has grown considerably in the last three years reflecting our geographic and product expansion 
gross premiums written the following table provides gross premiums written by line of business year ended december in thousands catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total our reinsurance segment provides treaty property and casualty reinsurance on a worldwide basis through our offices in bermuda  the u 
s and europe 
we initially began writing traditional catastrophe and property reinsurance from our bermuda office  however  following the commencement of our u 
s and european operations in  we have since expanded into specialty property risks  casualty  motor  credit and bond and other select risks 
the substantial increase in gross premiums written between and primarily reflects the early growth and market penetration of these new operations 
in  although we further increased our participation on all these lines of business  growth was naturally less significant than in earlier periods 
in addition unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced gross premiums written in relative to trends in our catastrophe account over the last three years are distorted by reinstatement premiums 
these were significantly higher in following cedants utilization of coverage in hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
excluding reinstatement premiums  we experienced growth in our catastrophe book of between and this was driven by significant rate increases  particularly on u 
s exposures impacted by the hurricane losses of growth  however  was tempered by our decision to reduce our aggregate natural peril catastrophe exposures on this line 
the decrease in gross premiums written in our property account in is driven by a reduction in our property pro rata renewal 
this was partially a result of certain cedants exiting the property market and was also due to the fact that such business was considered less attractive than in ceded premiums written premiums ceded as a percentage of gross premiums written was  and in  and respectively 
we primarily purchase reinsurance as and when market opportunities arise to mitigate the impact of catastrophe loss events 
consequently  the level of premiums ceded can fluctuate period to period 
the percentage of premiums ceded was lower in due to a reduction in the availability of appropriately priced coverage 
net premiums earned the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business year ended december in thousands catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total changes in net premiums earned reflect period to period changes in net premiums written and business mix  together with normal variability in earning patterns 
the increase in net premiums earned in each of the last two years has largely correlated to the growth in our net premiums written over this period 
changes in mix of business over this period have not significantly impacted this trend 
loss ratio the table below shows the components of our loss ratio year ended december current year  before hurricane losses hurricane losses prior period development loss ratio although major losses are an inevitable part of our business  the hurricane losses in and had such a significant impact that we have highlighted them separately above 
the net favorable development in includes percentage points  of strengthening to net reserves relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the favorable development in all three years was primarily due to better than expected claims experience on our property catastrophe and other short tail lines of business 
our loss ratio also fluctuates year on year depending on a number of other variables that include the volume of attritional losses  changes in mix of business and changes in pricing and other assumptions used to establish our loss ratios 
outlook generally  overall discipline throughout the global reinsurance marketplace continues 
we continue to experience the ongoing trend of greater risk and retention appetite in the industry bringing to bear modest price reductions 
for property catastrophe business  major buyers dropped lower layers in favor of larger limits at the upper end of their programs  whilst  for casualty reinsurance business  cedants tended to retain more business 
critically  we have not seen major slippage in terms and conditions 
rates continue to be up substantially for us catastrophe exposed reinsurance business relative to the st of january as an element of catch up to mid year levels took place 
however  the market dislocation evident at mid year renewals has further corrected 
reinsurance renewals in continental europe  where the primary renewal date is january st  were characterized by an abundance of capacity 
we expect that windstorm kyrill  which caused damage across a number of european countries in january of  will stabilize this marketplace 
finally  we expect the impact of recent florida legislation bypassing the private reinsurance marketplace to directly impact less than of reinsurance premiums 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as a holding company we have no substantial operations of our own and our assets consist primarily of our investments in subsidiaries 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries
