overview we have commercialized the first phosphate based lithium ion technology and have brought to market several products utilizing this technology 
our mission is to drive the wide adoption of high performance  safe  low cost energy storage systems by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest battery technology  saphion r  the extensive experience of our management team and the significant market opportunity available to us 
the introduction of lithium ion technology to the market was the result of consumer demand for high energy  small battery solutions to power portable electronic devices 
the battery industry  consequently  focused on high energy solutions at the expense of safety 
additionally  because of safety concerns  lithium ion technology has been limited in adoption to small format applications  such as notebook computers  cell phones and personal digital assistant devices 
our saphion r technology  a phosphate based cathode material  addresses the need for a safe lithium ion solution  especially in large format applications 
our business plan and strategy focus on the generation of revenue from a combination of product sales and licensing activities  while minimizing costs through a manufacturing plan that utilizes partnerships with contract manufacturers  and internal manufacturing efforts through our wholly owned subsidiaries in china 
these subsidiaries initiated operations in late fiscal we plan to drive the adoption of our saphion r technology by offering existing and new solutions that differentiate our own products and customers products in both the large format and small format markets 
in addition  we will seek to expand the fields of use of our saphion r technology through the licensing of our intellectual property related to our battery chemistries and manufacturing processes 
to date  we have achieved the following successes in implementing our business plan o proven the commercial feasibility of our technology  o launched new saphion r technology based products  including our n charge r power system family and introduced our u charge r power system family of products  intended to be a direct replacement for existing lead acid battery applications in the market today and to compete for emerging motive applications  o established relationships with top tier customers across many of the target markets for our products  while continuing to build our brand awareness in multiple channels  o closed and sold our high cost manufacturing facility in northern ireland and established key manufacturing partnerships in asia to facilitate low cost  quality production  o announced a joint technology development program with segway inc to develop long range battery packs using our saphion r technology for segway s human transporter product 
production of the segway battery packs began in march and they are currently available through segway s distribution channel  o consolidated three china locations into one site to serve as our powder production  research and development  and assembly facility  o developed a phosphate based lithium ion power cell 
batteries designed with power cells can be discharged and charged more quickly than batteries designed with energy cells 
this makes them ideal for applications that require powerful bursts rather than slow discharges of energy  such as portable appliances and future generations of hybrid and electric vehicles 
our new saphion r power cell offers significant cycling  weight and longevity benefits over nickel metal hydride nimeh and nickel cadmium nicd battery technologies 
total revenue decreased as compared to the prior year to million 
we achieved improvement in our gross margin and expanded our development and channel launch of saphion r based products 
we continued our efforts to transition our manufacturing and other operations to china through two wholly owned subsidiaries in suzhou  china 
our business headquarters is in austin  texas 
our materials research and development center is in las vegas  nevada 
our european sales and oem manufacturing support center is in mallusk  northern ireland 
our manufacturing and product development center is in suzhou  china 
basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  exit costs  contract settlement charges  and joint venture dissolution 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product shipments that are not recognized as revenue during the period shipped  primarily product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return  are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
for reseller shipments where revenue recognition is deferred  we record revenue based upon the reseller supplied reporting of sales to their end customers or their inventory reporting 
for direct customers  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon our historical experience 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are recorded as reductions to revenue as incurred 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note  impairment charge  regarding impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
exit costs we incurred exit costs associated with the closure of our northern ireland manufacturing facility 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recognize liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities at fair value in the period during which the liability is incurred 
we estimate the liabilities related to exit or disposal activities including lease termination costs  compensation of terminated employees  inventory obsolescence  costs to prepare assets for disposal or sale  and other expenses based upon our analysis of individual transaction circumstances  agreements and commitments 
some agreements may be revised  or actual results may be different from costs reasonably estimated at the incurrence of the liability 
in these cases  additional costs or reduced costs are recorded in the period incurred  and differences are disclosed in the footnotes to consolidated financial statements 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities are included in restructuring charges 
contract settlement charge since  pursuant to a letter of offer  we received employment and capital grants from the ireland development board  now known as invest northern ireland ini  for our former manufacturing facility in mallusk  northern ireland  totaling pound million 
under certain circumstances  ini had the right to reclaim a portion of these grants and had a security interest in the facility s land  building  and equipment 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with ini pursuant to which ini agreed to release us of all outstanding claims and other obligations owing to ini in connection with grants previously provided 
under the terms of the settlement agreement we agreed to pay ini pound million consisting of a pound million payment in cash and a pound million payment in common stock

liquidity and capital resources liquidity at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company expects our sources of liquidity will not be sufficient for the remaining fiscal year 
the company anticipates product sales during fiscal from the n charge r power system and the battery pack for segway  inc  which are subject to seasonal fluctuations and the sale of the u charge r power system will be insufficient to cover the company s operating expenses 
management depends upon our ability to periodically arrange for additional equity or debt financing to meet our liquidity requirements 
unless our product sales are greater than management currently forecasts or there are other changes to our business plan  we will need to arrange for additional financing within the next three to six months to fund operating and capital needs 
this financing could take the form of debt or equity 
given our historical operating results and the amount of our existing debt  as well as the other factors  we may not be able to arrange for debt or equity financing from third parties on favorable terms or at all 
the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the company s operations including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize the company s product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on the company s available liquidity sources during the remaining fiscal year 
as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses  our auditors have expressed in their report on our consolidated financial statements included in our audited march  consolidated financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we presently have no further commitments for financing by mr 
berg or any other source 
if we are unable to obtain financing from mr 
berg or others on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our assets 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments

our use of cash from operations during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
the cash used for operating activities during all periods was primarily for operating losses and working capital 
cash used for operating loss in fiscal was lower than in fiscal and primarily from the impact of decreases in some of the operating expenses as described above in the section titled operating expenses
