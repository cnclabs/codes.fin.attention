the corresponding periods ended january  contained weeks 
for comparability purposes  where noted  some of the information discussed below is based upon comparison of the weeks ended january  to the prior year corresponding period ended january  trends and uncertainties we have identified the following key uncertainties whose fluctuations may have a material effect on our operating results 
cash flow cash from operating activities is a primary source of liquidity that is adversely affected when the industry faces market driven challenges and new and existing competitors seek areas of growth to expand their businesses 
if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient quantities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our prices  the cost of goods sold on our income statement will correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income 
success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise is dependent upon customer fashion preferences 
store growth our growth is dependent on a number of factors which could prevent the opening of new stores  such as identifying suitable markets and locations 
sourcing store merchandise is dependent upon adequate and stable availability of materials and production facilities from which the company sources its merchandise

index to financial statements equity in earnings of joint ventures 
equity in earnings of joint ventures includes the company s portion of the income or loss of the company s unconsolidated joint ventures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results will differ from these under different assumptions or conditions 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail last in  first out lifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the specific identified cost method 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million and million as of february  and january   respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision have been insignificant for the years ended february   and january  and january  prior to the sale of its credit card business to ge  finance charge revenue earned on customer accounts serviced by the company under its proprietary credit card program was recognized in the period in which it was earned 
beginning november   the company s share of income earned under the long term marketing and servicing alliance is included as a component of service charges and other income 
the company received income of approximately million  million and million from ge in  and  respectively 
further pursuant to this agreement  the company has no continuing involvement other than to honor the ge credit cards in its stores 
although not obligated to a specific level of marketing commitment  the company participates in the marketing of the ge credit cards and accepts payments on the ge credit cards in its stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by mailing their payments to ge 
merchandise vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from its merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and margin maintenance programs 
cooperative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising  which could increase or decrease our expenditures 
similarly  we are not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for our stores 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
all other merchandise vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases when received 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor concessions has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or selling and administrative expenses 
the amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales have not varied significantly over the past three fiscal years 
insurance accruals 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation with a self insured retention of million per claim and general liability with a self insured retention of million per claim claims 
the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
as of february  and january   insurance accruals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for the years ended february  and january  further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for the fiscal year ended february  finite lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis annually as of the last day of the fourth quarter of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill annually as of the last day of the fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using projected discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and a terminal growth rate 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
the company s federal income tax return for each fiscal year is audited by the internal revenue service 
periodically  the company s income tax returns are audited by various state and local jurisdictions 
the company reserves for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the contingent amount is reasonably estimable 
these reserves are based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions as well as various tax filing positions 
due to the complexity of these examination issues  for which reserves have been recorded  it may be several years before the final resolution is achieved 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup high grade corporate yield curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate had increased to as of february  from as of january  we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the pension liability of million is appropriately stated as of february   however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately million 
we adopted sfas no

we are not able to determine with any degree of certainty the impact that these hurricanes had on our results of operations 
property and merchandise losses in the affected stores were covered by insurance 
our insurance coverage did not include business interruption but did include a provision for reimbursement of the loss of inventory in excess of the carrying value of the inventory 
our insurance coverage also covered losses sustained on damaged stores  and we are entitled to receive money for reimbursement of costs incurred to restore the damaged stores to their preexisting condition 
not all of the insurance money has been received for costs incurred on damaged stores affected by the hurricanes  but we will receive these amounts once all repairs are completed and a final settlement is reached with the insurance carrier

these increases were partially offset by savings in advertising expenses of million 
the increase in payroll expense was due to an increase in incentive compensation to store managers  merchants and management due to improved company performance during fiscal as well as the addition of the rd week in fiscal the increase in utility expense was a result of higher utility rates compared to the prior year in addition to the rd week in fiscal the savings in advertising expense was mainly due to the repositioning of our advertising efforts toward the most appropriate media sources to reach our targeted customers

due to the seasonality of the company s business  it has historically realized a significant portion of the cash flows from operating activities during the second half of the fiscal year 
retail sales are the key operating cash component providing and of total revenues over the past two years 
in november  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its private label credit card business to ge for billion  thus increasing the company s liquidity 
in connection with the sale  the company and ge have entered into a long term marketing and servicing alliance that provides for certain payments to be made by ge to the company  including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement 
the cash flows that the company receives under this alliance have been greater than the net cash flows provided by the company s credit business prior to its sale to ge due to quicker cash receipts 
the company received income of approximately million and million from ge in fiscal and while the company does not expect future cash flows under this alliance to vary significantly from historical levels  future amounts are difficult to predict 
the amount the company receives is dependent on the level of sales on ge accounts  the level of balances carried on the ge accounts by ge customers  payment rates on ge accounts  finance charge rates and other fees on ge accounts  the level of credit losses for the ge accounts as well as ge s funding costs 
operating cash inflows also include finance charges paid on company receivables prior to the sale  revenue and reimbursements from the long term marketing and servicing alliance with ge subsequent to the sale and cash distributions from joint ventures
