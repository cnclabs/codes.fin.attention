item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption recent developments  on may   the company filed a lawsuit against one of its component suppliers related to the quality of materials used in one of the company s dbs products that it has manufactured for about two and one half years 
the company believes that this material quality issue resulted in field performance issues of certain dbs products shipped by the company during calendar years to the company is currently working with its affected dbs customer to mitigate the impact of these field performance failures and to identify and implement a corrective action 
the company believes that this matter will adversely affect its sales volume with this dbs customer for fiscal and possibly beyond 
products division the products division develops  manufactures and sells devices and systems utilizing wireless technology that receive television programming transmitted from satellites and terrestrial transmission towers or that provide connectivity for access to critical information  data and entertainment content 
the products division currently generates most of its revenue from the sale of dbs outdoor reception equipment  with such sales accounting for approximately  and of total products division revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue of the company s products division amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company believes that dbs reception equipment will continue to be a significant portion of its overall revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s dbs reception products are installed at subscribers premises to receive subscription television programming signals that are transmitted from orbiting satellites 
these dbs reception products consist principally of reflector dish antennae  feedhorns  and electronics which receive  process and amplify satellite television signals for distribution over coaxial cable into the building 
the dish antenna reflects the satellite microwave signal back to a focal point where a feedhorn collects the microwaves and transfers the signals into an integrated amplifier downconverter that is referred to in the satellite industry as a low noise block downconverter with feed lnbf 
the microwave amplifier boosts the signal for further processing 
the downconverter reduces the signal from a microwave frequency into a lower intermediate frequency that is transmitted over coaxial cable and that a satellite television receiver can acquire  recognize and process to create a picture 
historically  the company s dbs business has experienced some seasonality 
the company s third fiscal quarter ending november tends to be the strongest sales period for this business because the dbs service providers typically are building up their inventory levels in advance of the year end holiday season when acquisition of new subscribers is higher 
the company s fourth fiscal quarter ending february tends to be the weakest sales period for this business because the dbs service providers typically are reducing their purchases to work down inventory levels following the year end holiday season 
notwithstanding this  in some years these seasonal patterns may be overshadowed by the timing of new product introductions  the phase out of older generation products  the service providers reallocation of purchasing volume among several suppliers  or by other factors 
the mm product line of the company s products division operates in the machine to machine industry that focuses on connecting machines to other machines  which can range from simple sensors to complex machines and computer servers 
the connectivity is achieved using wired and wireless networks  including  but not limited to  cellular wide area networks  wireless local area networks  satellite  ethernet  telephone  and the internet 
control and monitoring of remote devices are typically the purpose of mm applications 
controlling thermostats for demand side energy management  monitoring fuel liquid storage tanks  locating or tracking a car or other mobile asset  utility meter reading and control  and monitoring of an alarm panel are all examples of mm applications 
mm applications typically increase efficiency and lower costs for their owners by providing critical data in real or near real time 
by leveraging the internet and cellular infrastructure  mm applications can typically be monitored globally from anywhere an internet connection can be made 
with the continued growth in wireless network deployments  the company believes that wireless mm applications will be increasingly desired for their relative ease of deployment and geographic accessibility 
calamp s mm product line includes wireless modules compatible with cellular wide area networks that enable network connectivity for machines 
calamp also provides design  system integration and manufacturing services for mm products 
dataradio designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of wireless data products used in private wireless networks for both fixed and mobile applications 
these products are sold to city and county governments for public safety applications such as emergency response systems  and to utilities  oil and gas companies and transportation companies for critical infrastructure and industrial monitoring and control applications

the solutions division accounted for  and of consolidated revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
for additional information regarding the company s sales by business segment and geographical area  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing electronic devices  components and made to order assemblies used in the company s products are generally obtained from a number of suppliers  although certain components are obtained from sole source suppliers 
some devices or components are standard items while others are manufactured to the company s specifications by its suppliers 
the company believes that most raw materials are available from alternative suppliers 
however  any significant interruption in the delivery of such items could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
over the past several years  printed circuit board assembly has been outsourced to contract manufacturers in the pacific rim 
the company performs final assembly and test of most its satellite lnbf and other wireless access products at its facilities in oxnard  california 
printed circuit assemblies are mounted in various aluminum and plastic housings  electronically tested  and subjected to additional environmental tests on a sampled basis prior to packaging and shipping 
satellite dish antennas are manufactured on a subcontract basis by metal fabrication companies in the u 
s and china 
in addition  some of the company s satellite lnbf products are manufactured on a subcontract basis by companies in taiwan and mainland china 
a substantial portion of the company s components  and substantially all printed circuit board assemblies and housings  are procured from foreign suppliers and contract manufacturers located primarily in mainland china  taiwan  and other pacific rim countries 
any significant shift in us trade policy toward these countries  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of  or any political instability in  these countries  could cause disruption of the company s supply chain or otherwise disrupt the company s operations  which could adversely impact the company s business 
iso international certification the company became registered to iso in  and upgraded its registration to iso in iso is the widely recognized international standard for quality management in product design  manufacturing  quality assurance and marketing 
the company believes that iso certification is important to its business because most of the company s key customers expect their suppliers to have and maintain iso certification 
the registration assessment was performed by underwriter s laboratory  inc according to the iso international standard 
continuous assessments to maintain certification are performed semi annually  and the company has maintained its certification through each audit evaluation  most recently in april in addition  the company conducts internal audits of processes and procedures on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that the loss of its iso certification could have a material adverse effect on its operations  and the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in continuing to maintain such certification 
research and development each of the markets the company competes in is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and new product features to meet market requirements 
during the last three years  the company has focused its research and development resources primarily on satellite dbs products  mm applications and public safety data communication systems 
in addition  development resources were allocated to broaden existing product lines  reduce product costs and improve performance through product redesign efforts 
research and development expenses in fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
during this three year period the company s research and development expenses have ranged between and of annual consolidated revenues 
sales and marketing the company s revenues were derived mainly from customers in the united states  which represented  and of consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the products division sells its satellite reception products primarily to the two dbs system operators in the us for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
other wireless access products are sold directly to system operators as well as through distributors and system integrators 
the sales and marketing functions for the products division are located primarily at the company s corporate headquarters location in oxnard  california 
in addition  the products division has a small sales office in europe 
the mm and mrm product lines of the products division have offices in carlsbad  california 
the sales and marketing functions for dataradio are located in montreal  atlanta and waseca  minnesota 
the sales and marketing functions for the solutions division are located in san diego and oakland 
sales to customers that accounted for or more of consolidated annual sales in any one of the last three years  as a percent of consolidated sales  are as follows year ended february  customer segment echostar products directv products echostar communications corporation owns and operates the dish satellite television service in the us directv group inc is the largest satellite television service provider in the us the company believes that the loss of either echostar or directv as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
competition the company s markets are highly competitive 
in addition  if the markets for the company s products grow  the company anticipates increased competition from new companies entering such markets  some of whom may have financial and technical resources substantially greater than those of the company 
the company believes that competition in its markets is based primarily on performance  reputation  product reliability  technical support and price 
the company s continued success in these markets will depend in part upon its ability to continue to design and manufacture quality products at competitive prices 
products division the company believes that its existing principal competitors for its dbs products business include sharp  wistron neweb corporation  winegard company  andrew corporation  microelectronics technology  inc  funai and pro brand 
based on information announced quarterly by the us dbs system operators as to the total number of subscribers and the subscriber turnover rate  the company believes that it is a leading supplier of outdoor subscriber premise equipment to the us dbs television industry 
because the company s satellite products are not proprietary  it is possible that they may be duplicated by low cost producers  resulting in price and margin pressures 
the company believes that the principal competitors for its non dbs wireless products include motorola  m a com  ipmobilnet  mds  freewave  genx  sierra wireless  transystem inc and niigata seimitsu 
solutions division the solutions division s telalert urgent messaging software product competes against companies such as alarmpoint systems and mir  both of which are privately held companies 
backlog the company s products are sold to customers that do not usually enter into long term purchase agreements  and as a result  the company s backlog at any date is not significant in relation to its annual sales 
in addition  because of customer order modifications  cancellations  or orders requiring wire transfers or letters of credit from international customers  the company s backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of sales for any future period 
intellectual property products division in the company s dbs business  the company s timely application of its technology and its design  development and marketing capabilities have been of substantially greater importance to its business than patents or licenses 
however  patents and licenses are of significant importance in most of the product division s other business operations 
at february   the products division had patents ranging from design features for downconverter and antenna products to its multicipher broadband scrambling system 
those that relate to its downconverter products do not give the company any significant advantage since other manufacturers using different design approaches can offer similar microwave products in the marketplace 
in addition to its awarded patents  the products division has one patent application pending 
solutions division the solutions division relies primarily on a combination of trademark  copyright  service mark  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in the solutions division s products and services 
use by customers of the solutions division s software is governed by executed license agreements 
the solutions division also enters into written agreements with each of its resellers for the distribution of its software 
in addition  the solutions division seeks to avoid disclosure of trade secrets by requiring each of its employees and others with access to proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
the solutions division protects its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
calamp r is a federally registered trademark of the company 
employees at february   the company had approximately employees and approximately contracted production workers 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
the contracted production workers are engaged through independent temporary labor agencies in california

item a 
risk factors the following list describes several risk factors which are unique to our company the company is dependent on its significant customers  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future sales and its ability to sustain its growth 
the company s top two customers  echostar and directv  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total net sales for fiscal echostar and directv in the aggregate accounted for of calamp s total net sales for fiscal and of its total net sales for fiscal the loss of either echostar or directv as a customer  a deterioration in the overall business of either of them  or a decrease in the volume of sales by either of them  could result in decreased sales and could have a material adverse impact on calamp s ability to grow its dbs business 
a substantial decrease or interruption in business from any of the company s significant customers could result in write offs or in the loss of future business and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not currently have long term contracts with customers and our customers may cease purchasing products at any time  which could significantly harm our revenues 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not currently provide us with any assurance of future sales 
these customers can cease purchasing products from us at any time without penalty  they are free to purchase products from our competitors  they may expose us to competitive price pressure on each order and they are not required to make minimum purchases 
because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than us  we cannot be certain that our products will continue to be accepted in the marketplace or capture increased market share 
the market for dbs products and other wireless products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles  and price erosion 
we expect competition to intensify as our competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
given the highly competitive environment in which we operate  we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages currently enjoyed by our products will be sufficient to establish and sustain our products in the market 
any increase in price or other competition could result in erosion of our market share  to the extent we have obtained market share  and would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully 
information about the company s competitors is included in part i  item of this annual report on form k under the heading competition 
multiple factors beyond the company s control may cause fluctuations in our operating results and may cause our business to suffer 
the revenues and results of our operations may fluctuate significantly  depending on a variety of factors  including the following our dependence on a few major customers in our satellite products business that currently account for a substantial majority of our overall sales  the introduction of new products and services by competitors  and seasonality in the equipment market for the us dbs subscription television industry 
we will not be able to control many of these factors 
in addition  if our revenues in a particular period do not meet expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period  which could cause our business to suffer 
our business is subject to many factors that could cause the company s quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate and its stock price to be volatile 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include the timing and amount of  or cancellation or rescheduling of  orders for our products  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements  new product introductions and reductions in price of products offered by our competitors  our ability to achieve cost reductions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products  our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  our ability to maintain the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers  increased competition  particularly from larger  better capitalized competitors  fluctuations in demand for our products and services  and telecommunications and wireless market conditions specifically and economic conditions generally 
due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates  purchase orders and product availability  significant volume shipments of products could occur at the end of a fiscal quarter 
failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect operating results 
in the future  our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice 
due to these and other factors  our quarterly revenue  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because some of our components  assemblies and electronics manufacturing services are purchased from sole source suppliers or require long lead times  our business is subject to unexpected interruptions  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
some of our key components are complex to manufacture and have long lead times 
also  our dbs dish antennas  lnbf housings  subassemblies and some of our electronic components are purchased from sole source vendors for which alternative sources are not readily available 
in the event of a reduction or interruption of supply  or a degradation in quality  as many as six months could be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers  if any 
as a result  product shipments could be delayed and revenues and results of operations could suffer 
furthermore  if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand  customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share 
if we do not meet product introduction deadlines  our business could be adversely affected 
our inability to develop new products or product features on a timely basis  or the failure of new products or product features to achieve market acceptance  could adversely affect our business 
in the past  calamp has experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed the development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements and which caused them to incur unexpected expenses 
in addition  some of our existing customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on the addition of product features 
in the past we have experienced delays in introducing new features 
furthermore  in order to compete in some markets  we will have to develop different versions of existing products that operate at different frequencies and comply with diverse  new or varying governmental regulations in each market 
if demand for our products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably  it may be difficult to manage the business efficiently which may result in reduced gross margins and profitability 
our cost structure will be based in part on our expectations for future demand 
many costs  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for our products may make it difficult to plan production capacity and business operations efficiently 
if demand is significantly below expectations  we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs  which can diminish gross margins and cause losses 
a sudden downturn may also leave us with excess inventory  which may be rendered obsolete as products evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products 
our ability to reduce costs and expenses may be further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base 
conversely  in the event of a sudden upturn  we may incur significant costs to rapidly expedite delivery of components  procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes 
these costs could reduce our gross margins and overall profitability 
any of these results could adversely affect our business 
because we currently sell  and we intend to grow  the sales of certain of our products in countries other than the united states  we are subject to different regulatory schemes 
we may not be able to develop products that work with the standards of different countries  which could result in our inability to sell our products  and  further  we may be subject to political  economic  and other conditions affecting such countries that could result in reduced sales of our products and which could adversely affect our business 
if our sales are to grow in the longer term  we believe we must grow our international business 
many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations  including safety regulations  radio frequency allocation schemes and standards 
if we cannot develop products that work with different standards  we will be unable to sell our products in those locations 
if compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate  our business would be adversely affected 
some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be forced to comply 
furthermore  standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change 
if we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
sales to customers outside the us accounted for  and of calamp s total sales for the fiscal years ended february   and  respectively 
assuming that we continue to sell our products to such customers  we will be subject to the political  economic and other conditions affecting countries or jurisdictions other than the us  including africa  the middle east  europe and asia 
any interruption or curtailment of trade between the countries in which we operate and our present trading partners  change in exchange rates  significant shift in us trade policy toward these countries  or significant downturn in the political  economic or financial condition of these countries  could cause demand for and sales of our products to decrease  or subject us to increased regulation including future import and export restrictions  any of which could adversely affect our business 
additionally  a substantial portion of our components and subassemblies are currently procured from foreign suppliers located primarily in hong kong  mainland china  taiwan  and other pacific rim countries 
any significant shift in us trade policy toward these countries or a significant downturn in the political  economic or financial condition of these countries could cause disruption of our supply chain or otherwise disrupt operations  which could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position 
other than in our dbs products business  which currently does not depend upon patented technology  our ability to succeed in the wireless access business may depend  in large part  upon our intellectual property for some of our wireless products as well as software applications marketed by our solutions division 
we currently rely primarily on patents  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
these mechanisms provide us with only limited protection 
we currently hold patents and have patent application pending 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with all of our executive officers  managers and supervisory employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
the protection of our intellectual property rights may not provide us with any legal remedy should our competitors independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services  or design around any intellectual property rights we hold 
we may be subject to infringement claims which may disrupt the conduct of our business and affect our profitability 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others  even though we take steps to assure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporate unlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products 
it is possible that third parties may claim that our products and services may infringe upon their trademark  patent  copyright  or trade secret rights 
any such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  expensive  cause delays in introducing new or improved products or services  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challenged intellectual property 
successful infringement claims against us may materially disrupt the conduct of our business and affect profitability 
we may engage in future acquisitions that have adverse consequences for our business 
in april we completed the acquisition of the assets and business of kaul tronics  inc  in april we completed the acquisition of vytek  and in april we acquired the skybility business 
in may we acquired dataradio and the technocom mrm product line  in march we acquired aircept and in april we acquired smartlink radio networks 
we may make additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the future in order to complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities 
the acquisitions that we have completed and that we may complete in the future could result in the following  any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock issuances of our equity securities that would dilute the percentage ownership of our current stockholders  large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  difficulties in the assimilation and integration of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  contractual disputes  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired organizations 
availability of radio frequencies may restrict the growth of the wireless communications industry and demand for our products 
radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services 
the allocation of frequencies is regulated in the united states and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services 
the growth of the wireless communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or  alternatively  if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use 
industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the availability of licenses required to use frequencies and related costs 
over the last several years  frequency spectrum has been reallocated for specific applications and the related frequency relocation costs have increased significantly 
this significant reassignment of spectrum has slowed and may continue to slow the growth of the industry 
growth is slowed because some customers have funding constraints limiting their ability to purchase new technology to upgrade systems and the financial results for a number of businesses have been affected by the industry s rate of growth 
slowed industry growth may restrict the demand for our products 
a failure to rapidly transition or to transition at all to newer digital technologies could adversely affect our business 
our success  in part  will be affected by the ability of our wireless businesses to continue their transition to newer digital technologies  and to successfully compete in these markets and gain market share 
we face intense competition in these markets from both established companies and new entrants 
product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive to develop and bring to market 
we will depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others  unproven business models and emerging wireless carrier models to deliver existing services and to grow 
if we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems 
all of our services will be delivered using airtime purchased from third parties 
we will depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted service free from errors or defects and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service 
in addition  our expenses would increase and profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services 
our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one year terms 
some of these wireless carriers are  or could become  our competitors  and if they compete with us  they may refuse to provide us with their services 
our software may contain defects or errors  and its sales could decrease if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software 
our current software products and platforms are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of customers 
therefore  we must develop services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets 
software as complex as that which will be offered by us is likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
some existing contracts related to software contain provisions that require us to repair or replace products that fail to work 
to the extent that such products are repaired or replaced in the future  our expenses may increase  resulting in a decline in our gross margins 
in addition  our software may not be free from errors or defects after delivery to customers has begun  which could result in the rejection of our software or services  damage to our reputation  lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased service and warranty costs 
new laws and regulations that impact the industry could increase costs or reduce opportunities for us to earn revenue 
except as described below under governmental regulation  we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered in california 
however  in the future  we may become subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
in addition  the wireless carriers that supply airtime and certain hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the fcc and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services 
governmental regulation dataradio s products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the united states  canada and other countries in which it operates 
in the united states  the federal communications commission fcc regulates many aspects of communication devices including radiation electromagnetic energy  biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to the telephone network 
in canada  similar regulations are administered by industry canada 
although dataradio has obtained necessary fcc and industry canada approvals for all products it currently sells  there can be no assurance that such approvals can be obtained for future products on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  such regulatory requirements may change or the company may not in the future be able to obtain all necessary approvals from countries other than canada or the united states in which it currently sells its products or in which it may sell its products in the future 
the fcc and industry canada may be slow in adopting new regulations allowing private wireless networks to deliver higher data rates in licensed frequency bands for public safety applications 
this could adversely affect demand for private networks as traditional private network users may opt for public network connections for all or part of their wireless communication needs 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition since dataradio s products are used in private networks but not public networks

no loss accrual has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for this matter 
in addition to the foregoing matter  the company from time to time is a party  either as plaintiff or defendant  to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview calamp is a provider of wireless communications products that enable anytime anywhere access to critical information  data and entertainment content 
the company is a leading supplier of direct broadcast satellite dbs outdoor customer premise equipment to the us satellite television market 
the company also provides wireless data communication solutions for the telemetry and asset tracking markets  private wireless networks  public safety communications and critical infrastructure and process control applications 
the company s dbs reception products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar communications corporation and directv group inc  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
the company sells its other wireless access products directly to system operators as well as through distributors and system integrators 
on may  the company acquired privately held dataradio inc  a leading supplier of proprietary advanced wireless data systems  products  and solutions for public safety  critical infrastructure and industrial control applications  for a cash payment of canadian million  or us million at the effective exchange rate 
dataradio has a diversified customer base with no single customer accounting for more than of dataradio s total revenue 
dataradio has approximately employees in facilities located in montreal  minnesota and georgia 
the dataradio acquisition expanded calamp s wireless data communications business while furthering the company s strategic goals of diversifying its customer base and expanding its product offerings into higher margin growth markets 
dataradio s results of operations are included in calamp s fiscal results of operations for the week period from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal  during which dataradio generated revenue of million and gross profit of million 
in connection with the acquisition of dataradio the company recorded a charge of  to write off in process research and development costs of the acquired business as part of the purchase price allocation 
also on may   the company acquired the mobile resource management mrm product line from privately held technocom corporation for million in cash and an earn out payment equal to revenues in excess of  during the month period following the acquisition 
this product line is used to help track fleets of cars and trucks 
sales of the mrm product line are included in calamp s fiscal results of operations for the week period from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal  during which this product line contributed revenue of million and gross profit of million 
in april  the company acquired the business and certain assets of skybility  a privately held company located in carlsbad  california  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated april  skybility is a developer and supplier of embedded cellular transceivers used in telemetry and asset tracking applications that operate on the advanced mobile phone service amps analog network using global positioning satellite gps technology 
the skybility business operates as the machine to machine mm product line of the company s products division 
the company s acquisition of vytek corporation vytek in april gave rise to goodwill of approximately million 
in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  the goodwill of million was apportioned between calamp s solutions division and products division because both divisions were expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the apportionment analysis resulted in allocating million of the goodwill to the products division and the remaining million to the solutions division 
as a result of the fiscal annual impairment test of the solutions division goodwill conducted as of april   the company determined that there was an impairment of goodwill  and accordingly  an impairment charge was recorded in fiscal in the amount of  in addition  the company recorded an  impairment charge related to the other intangible assets arising from the vytek acquisition 
the impairment charges reflect the declining revenues associated with the solutions division s information technology professional consulting business  due primarily to the inability of the solutions division to generate new recurring revenue streams to grow the business 
the company s revenue consists principally of sales of satellite television outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry  which accounted for  and of consolidated revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dbs system operators have approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market grew by from million subscribers to approximately million subscribers at december  the demand for the company s products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from one of calamp s key customers in calamp s satellite products business and the company s ability  as well as the ability of its customers  to manage inventory  the rate of growth in the overall subscriber base in the us dbs market  the economic and market conditions in the wireless communications markets  calamp s ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which calamp s present and future customers and end users adopt the company s products and technologies in its target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of the company s products 
for these and other reasons  the company s net revenue in fiscal may not necessarily be indicative of future years revenue amounts 
from time to time  the company s key customers significantly reduce their product orders  or may place significantly larger orders  either of which can cause the company s quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
significant opportunities for the company include increasing the company s market share for outdoor reception equipment in the us dbs market and expanding its presence in wireless industry market segments for both fixed and mobile wireless applications 
the company s principal challenges include maintaining and improving products division gross margins and eliminating operating losses in the solutions division 
basis of presentation the company uses a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to february  which for fiscal years  and fell on march   february  and february   respectively 
in these consolidated financial statements  the fiscal year end for all years is shown as february for clarity of presentation 
fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal years and each consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  or due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is quite concentrated  with two customers accounting for of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of sales 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income tax valuation allowance deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
at february   the company had an aggregate deferred tax credit balance of  the current portion of this amount is a deferred tax asset of  and the noncurrent portion is a deferred tax liability of  the noncurrent portion of deferred income taxes is comprised primarily of i a deferred tax liability of  associated with acquired intangible assets of dataradio and ii a deferred tax liability of  related to goodwill arising from certain acquisitions in prior years that is amortizable for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes 
vytek  which was acquired by the company in april  has tax loss carryforwards and other tax assets that the company believes will be utilizable to some extent in the future  subject to change of ownership limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and to the ability of the combined post merger company to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefits before the expiration of the applicable carryforward periods 
at february   the company has a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  relating to the assets acquired in the vytek purchase 
if in the future a portion or all of the  valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance will decrease the goodwill balance associated with the solutions division 
conversely  if in the future the company were to change its realization probability assessment to less than  the company would provide an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax asset  which would increase the income tax provision 
the company also has deferred tax assets for canadian income tax purposes arising from the acquisition of dataradio amounting to  at february   which relate primarily to research and development tax credits for canadian federal and quebec provincial income taxes 
of this total canadian deferred tax assets amount   existed at the time of the dataradio acquisition in may and  arose subsequent to the acquisition 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against these canadian deferred tax assets at february  if in the future a portion or all of the  valuation allowance for the canadian deferred tax assets is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance up to  will decrease the goodwill balance associated with the dataradio acquisition  and reductions of the valuation allowance in excess of  will reduce the income tax provision 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet may exist 
the company tests the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
goodwill of the products division and solutions division is tested annually for impairment on december and april  respectively 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  the company typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that business and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  the company determines whether it needs to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and its internal forecasts 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the company s reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on the balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
in fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges on goodwill and other intangible assets of the solutions division of  and  respectively  as further described in note at february   the company had million in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on its balance sheet 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales price is probable 
in cases where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
the company also undertakes projects that include the design  development and manufacture of public safety communication systems that are specially customized to customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project 
recent developments during fiscal  the company received notification from echostar  its largest customer  that it was encountering field performance issues with a dbs product that the company shipped during calendar years through after examining the various component parts used in the manufacture of these products  it was determined by the company that the performance issues were the result of a deterioration of the laminate material used in the printed circuit boards of these products 
during fiscal  echostar returned approximately  units to the company for testing and possible rework  the majority of which were received by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal an additional  units have been returned by echostar to the company subsequent to fiscal  and it is possible that additional units may be returned to the company in the future 
from the time the problem was isolated to the laminate material until march  the company worked with the supplier of the laminate material and with echostar to identify a corrective action 
notwithstanding these efforts  on march  the laminate supplier filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the state of massachusetts in which it claimed that it is not responsible for the field performance issues of these dbs products 
also in march  the company learned that echostar had awarded its orders for this dbs product for future requirements beginning in june to other suppliers 
the company believes that the field performance issues were the primary reason for the loss of this business 
the company has continued to work with echostar to mitigate the impact of these performance issues and to identify and implement a corrective action plan 
the company believes that this matter will adversely affect its sales volume with echostar for fiscal on may   the company filed a lawsuit against the laminate supplier in the us district court for the central district of california for negligence  strict product liability  intentional misrepresentation and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage  among other causes of action 
the company has established a warranty reserve as of february  that it believes is adequate to cover the resolution of these field performance issues with echostar 
however  if the ultimate resolution of this matter causes the reserve amount to be exceeded  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations

revenue of the solutions division decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decline is primarily the result of the loss of key customers in the solutions division s information technology professional consulting business which led to management s decision to exit this business at the end of first quarter of fiscal the information technology professional consulting business generated revenue of approximately million in fiscal revenue of the solutions division for fiscal is less than of the company s consolidated revenue 
gross profit and gross margins products division gross profit decreased slightly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this change is the net result of a decrease of million in the gross profit of the pre existing products division from fiscal to fiscal and the gross profit contribution of dataradio and the technocom product line of million for the week period from the date of acquisition to the end of fiscal gross profit of the pre existing products division declined in fiscal compared to fiscal because of the  decline in revenue and a shift in product mix toward lower margin end of life dbs products 
in addition  freight costs for incoming materials of the pre existing products division was million higher in fiscal compared to the fiscal because of the company s decision to expedite materials in order to meet customer requirements in response to supply chain disruptions and demand volatility 
based on information currently available to the company  management does not believe that this higher level of freight costs will exist in fiscal the products division gross margin in fiscal was compared to in fiscal in fiscal  dataradio and the technocom product line generated an aggregate gross margin of and the pre existing products division generated a gross margin of 
the decline in gross margin of the pre existing products division is primarily the result of higher freight costs and lower margins on final shipments of end of life dbs products 
solutions division gross profit in fiscal decreased  or  from fiscal the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to the loss of key customers within the solutions division which led to management s decision to exit the professional consulting business in the first quarter of fiscal the solutions division gross margin was and in fiscal years and  respectively
