overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depend  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past and continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
our return to profitability in fiscal after several years of losses was directly related to an increase in the level of exploration for domestic oil and natural gas reserves by the petroleum industry since the increased level of exploration is a function of higher prices for oil and natural gas 
as a result of the increase in domestic exploration spending  we have experienced an increased demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services  particularly from entities seeking natural gas reserves 
while the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
in addition  we continue to experience high demand for our services despite recent fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
because the majority of our current clients are focused on the exploration for and production of natural gas  a sustained significant decline in the price of natural gas would have an adverse effect on the demand for our services 
we continue to focus on increasing the revenues and profitability of our existing crews by upgrading our recording capacity  expanding the channel count on existing crews  adding to our energy source fleet and utilizing related technologies 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our 
table of contents revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  or equipment failure 
consequently  our successful efforts to negotiate more favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
although our clients may cancel their supplemental service agreements with us on short notice  we believe we currently have a sufficient order book to sustain operations at full capacity well into calendar with all fifteen crews 
fiscal highlights our financial performance for fiscal significantly improved when compared to our financial performance for fiscal as a result of the continuing strong demand for our seismic services due to high levels of exploration and development activities  particularly by entities seeking natural gas reserves 
as a result of continuing high demand  we deployed our thirteenth crew in october equipped with an existing i o system ii cable based recording system 
deployed our fourteenth crew in april equipped with a  channel aram aries recording system  the company s largest crew in its year history 
replaced an i o system ii mrx recording system on an existing crew with a  channel aram aries recording system in july deployed our fifteenth crew in september equipped with a  channel aram aries recording system 
increased channel count from approximately  to in excess of added over  geophones 
took delivery of eighteen vibrator energy source units increasing the total count to units company wide 
added vehicles to our fleet 
operated in west texas  the fort worth basin  south texas  oklahoma  north dakota  new mexico  wyoming  new york  west virginia  pennsylvania  alabama  arkansas  utah and mississippi 
added gps navigation and tracking systems to the vibrator energy source units on two crews for improved efficiency and accuracy of source point location 
added data processing services to the oklahoma city office 
took delivery of a  channel aram aries recording system which replaced an i o system ii mrx recording system on an existing crew in november fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services 
revenue growth in fiscal was primarily due to the addition of three seismic data acquisition crews along with pricing and productivity improvements realized from the expanded capabilities of existing crews 
recorded in the fourth quarter revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies  and dynamite energy sources all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained increase in these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued geographic expansion in response to increased exploration activities in the appalachian basin  the rocky mountains  the fayetteville shale  and the arkoma basin 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the full year of service for the twelfth crew fielded in fiscal and the start up and 
table of contents ongoing expenses of the three acquisition crews deployed in fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenues in fiscal while the ratio of general and administrative expenses to revenue declined in fiscal due to the increase in revenues  the actual dollar amount increased 
the increase of  from fiscal to fiscal reflects ongoing expenses necessary to support expanded field operations 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting the full year of depreciation expense from our fiscal capital expenditures 
our depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase in fiscal as a result of our significant capital expenditures in fiscal our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of changes in tax legislation that impact the company s operations and changes in state tax rates as a result of the varying states in which we operate from year to year 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services 
we were able to field an additional data acquisition crew  expand the capabilities of our existing crews  obtain price improvements in the markets for our services and negotiate favorable contract provisions 
we began fiscal with eleven data acquisition crews and added our twelfth crew in june recorded in the fourth quarter revenues are unusually high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies  and dynamite energy sources all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the increase in these charges was driven by our continued geographic expansion during the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to increased exploration activities in the appalachian basin  the rocky mountains  the fayetteville shale  and the arkoma basin 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the full year of service for the tenth and eleventh crews fielded in fiscal and the start up and ongoing expenses of the twelfth data acquisition crew deployed in june as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenues in fiscal while the ratio of general and administrative expenses to revenue declined in fiscal due to the increase in revenues  the actual dollar amount increased

our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
our income tax expense was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase in expense for from is primarily a result of our substantial increase in income before income taxes resulting in increased federal and state income taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  our capital expenditures 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect an increase in total revenues resulting from our expanded business and an increase in accounts receivable without a correlating increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal these results primarily represent capital expenditures and activity in the short term investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were funded with cash generated from operations  short term investments  and during fiscal with cash from our revolving line of credit agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  primarily representing the draw down of  from our line of credit and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures 
for fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of  in part to complete the fielding of three additional data acquisition crews  to expand channel count on existing crews  to purchase eighteen additional energy source units  and to replace two i o system ii recording systems on existing crews with aram aries recording systems 
the board of directors approved an initial fiscal budget of  to add to the company s energy source fleet  to purchase additional recording channels  to make technical improvements in various phases of the company s operations  and to meet maintenance capital requirements 
these additions will allow the company to maintain its competitive position as it responds to client desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording services and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings 
our revolving line of credit loan agreement is with western national bank 
in january  we renewed the agreement for an additional year and increased the size of the facility from million to million 
the agreement permits us to borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until january   up to million 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable and related collateral 
interest on the outstanding amount under the line of credit loan agreement is payable monthly at a rate equal to the prime rate 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on distributions and dividends  disposition of assets and mergers and acquisitions 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreement of million and maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities  and debt to tangible net worth 
on july   we borrowed million under this credit loan agreement for working capital purposes 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  and december  we expect to renew this revolving line of credit loan agreement for an additional year through january on the same terms and conditions 
on august   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the periodic offer and sale from time to time of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common stock  and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities  after the registration statement has been declared effective by the sec  in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be 
table of contents determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be separately filed with the sec at the time of the offering 
the filing of the shelf registration statement enables us to act quickly as opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations with initial terms exceeding one year as of september  payments due by period in s less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations we believe that our capital resources and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements including the continued expansion of our capital equipment through cash flow from operations  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit and  if necessary  from capital markets offerings 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and to fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
under both types of agreements  we recognize revenues when revenue is realizable and services are performed 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
revenues are considered realizable when earned according to the terms of the service contracts 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount  including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our review of past due accounts  our past experience of historical write offs and our current customer base 
the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our customers 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our forecast of future cash 
table of contents flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and future gross margins based on our historical results and analysis of future oil and gas prices which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if we are unable to achieve these cash flows  an impairment charge would be recorded 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment are capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
we amortize these capitalized items using the straight line method 
tax accounting 
we account for our income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate and reducing the deferred tax asset by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create a variance between actual results and estimates and could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize compensation cost in our financial statements 
we adopted sfas r beginning october  for stock based compensation awards granted after that date and for nonvested awards outstanding at that date using the modified prospective application method 
we record compensation expense as operating or general and administrative expense as appropriate in the statements of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that fin may have on our statements of operations and statements of financial position 
thus far  our evaluation does not reflect any material adjustments 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies that fair value is the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
further  the standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices which affect demand for and pricing of our services and interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had no indebtedness  however  on july   we borrowed million under the terms of the revolving line of credit loan agreement with western national bank for working capital purposes 
interest payable under the revolving line of credit is variable based upon the then current prime rate 
at september   we did not have any short term investments 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally  so we are not generally subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
