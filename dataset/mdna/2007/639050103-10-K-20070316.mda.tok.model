item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in this report 
third party reimbursement in the us  health care providers generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid  and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform 
third party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services 
in general  reimbursement for newborn screening is included in the lump sum payment for the newborn s birth and hospitalization 
for this reason  we are not able to measure a reimbursement success rate for our screening products 
customer service and support we provide a one year warranty on all medical device products 
we also sell extended service agreements on our medical device products 
service for our domestic customers is provided by a company owned service center that performs all service  repair  and calibration services 
service for our international customers is provided by a combination of company owned facilities and third party vendors on a contract basis 
manufacturing other companies manufacture a significant portion of the components used in our products  however  we perform final assembly  testing  and packaging of most of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency 
we also use contract vendors to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products 
we perform regular quality audits of these vendors 
we purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our quality specifications and inspections 
we conduct quality audits of our key suppliers  several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices  or supplies for use with medical devices 
most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier 
our manufacturing  service  and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state  and foreign regulatory authorities 
our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the fda and other state government agencies 
we are required to conduct our product design  testing  manufacturing  and control activities in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner 
we have passed all quality system regulations inspections of our facilities conducted by the fda and respective states 
in addition  our production facilities have received iso certification 
iso certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical 
table of contents device companies meet the standards of quality on a worldwide basis 
we have also received the ec certificate pursuant to the european union medical device directive eec  which allowed us to place a ce mark on our products after assembling appropriate documentation 
research and development we are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy 
internal product development capabilities 
we believe that product development capabilities are essential to provide our customers with new product offerings 
we plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings 
partnerships that complement our expertise 
we continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us 
by taking advantage of our core competencies  we believe that we can bring products to market in an efficient manner  and leverage our distribution channels 
new opportunities through technology acquisition 
we continue to evaluate new  emerging  and complementary technologies in order to identify new product opportunities 
with our knowledge of our current markets we believe that we can effectively develop technologies into successful new products 
our research and development expenses were million or of total revenue in  million or of total revenue in  and million or of total revenue in proprietary rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  and corporate partners  and seek to control access to our intellectual property  distribution channels  documentation  and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
the intellectual rights to some of the original patents for technology incorporated into our products are now in the public domain 
however  we do not consider these patents  or any currently viable patent or related group of patents to be of such importance that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business 
we capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property  as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights  and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets 
competition we sell our products in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets 
we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small  privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our medical devices 
in the us  we sell our supply products in a mature market 
because these products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 

table of contents we believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our products  include level of specificity  sensitivity  and reliability of the product  time required to obtain results with the product  such as to test for or treat a clinical condition  relative ease of use of the product  depth and breadth of the products features  quality of customer support for the product  frequency of product updates  extent of third party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure  extent to which the products conform to standards of care guidelines  and price of the product 
we believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products 
different competitors may have competitive advantages in one or more of the categories listed above and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 
government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  the medical devices we sell  with the exception of some disposable products in our newborn care line of products  must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations under the food  drug  and cosmetics act  as amended clearance via section k  or premarket approval via section if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval via section is much more costly  lengthy  and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take longer 
we cannot be sure that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed 
the fda places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either class i or class ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
the premarket notification must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to an existing legally marketed device that is a class i  class ii  pre amendment class iii device  or any of those for which the fda has not yet called for submission of a premarket approval 
the fda places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  in its class iii classification 
the fda requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process via section in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a premarket approval application must provide extensive pre clinical and clinical trial data 

table of contents the fda may require results of clinical trials in support of a k submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application 
in order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant risk device  the fda requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain  in advance  an investigational device exemption 
the investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
if the fda and the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational device exemption application for a significant risk device  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial 
an investigational device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol  including the number of patients and study sites 
if the manufacturer deems the product a non significant risk device  the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements 
if the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non significant risk determination  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial 
we received approval for our olympic cool cap product as a class iii device from the fda through the premarket approval process 
most of our other products in our newborn hearing screening  diagnostic hearing  eeg monitoring  polysomnography  and newborn care product lines have been approved by the fda as class ii devices 
some of our disposable products  such as our nascor neonatal headshields and oxygen delivery systems have received fda approval as class i devices 
the fda to date has not regulated data management software  including our neometrics newborn screening data management system 
fda regulation numerous fda regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices 
these requirements include fda quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create  implement  and follow design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures  medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda certain types of adverse and other events involving their products  and fda general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses 
class ii and class iii devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them  such as performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries  and fda guidelines that may not apply to class i devices 
we believe we are in compliance with the applicable fda guidelines  but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the fda changes its existing regulations or adopts new requirements 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to adequately comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  withdrawal of k clearance or pre market approval already granted  or criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require us to repair  replace  or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 

table of contents other us regulations we also must comply with numerous additional federal  state  and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  biohazards  fire hazard control  and hazardous substance disposal 
we believe we are currently in compliance with applicable safety  quality  environmental protection  biohazard  and hazardous substance disposal regulations 
foreign regulation in the foreign countries in which we sell or plan to sell our fda regulated products  these products are also regulated as medical devices  and are subject to regulatory requirements by foreign governmental agencies similar to those of the fda 
our manufacturing facilities are audited and have been certified to be isol en compliant  which allows us to sell our products in europe 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to ce mark and iso inspection by t v rheinland 
we plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from fda requirements 
employees on december   we had approximately full time employees worldwide 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors we have completed a number of acquisitions and expect to complete additional acquisitions in the future 
there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and we may not achieve the expected benefit of any of our acquisitions we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar pacific consultants during  we acquired the assets of neometrics inc and affiliated entities during  and we acquired fischer zoth in in january we completed the acquisition of bio logic 
in september and october we completed the acquisitions deltamed and olympic medical  and certain assets from nascor 
we expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses in future periods 
the acquisitions that we have completed may not result in improved operating results for us  or in our achieving a financial condition superior to that which we would have achieved had we not completed them 
our results of operations may be adversely impacted by costs associated to our acquisitions  including one time charges associated with restructurings or in process research and development assets 
our acquisitions could fail to produce the benefits that we anticipate  or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
in addition  some of the assumptions that we have relied upon  such as achievement of operating synergies  may not be realized 
in this event  one or more of the acquisitions could result in reduced earnings of natus as compared to the earnings that would have been achieved by natus if the acquisition had not occurred 
if we fail to successfully manage the combined operations of natus and the businesses we have acquired  we may not realize the potential benefits of the acquisition 
our corporate headquarters are located in san carlos  
table of contents california 
bio logic s primary offices are located in illinois  olympic medical s operations are in washington  neometrics operations are located in new york  deltamed s operations are in france  and fischer zoth s operations are in germany 
the geographical distance between our various facilities may further adversely affect our ability to manage these operations 
if we fail to manage these disparate operations effectively  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave  and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits of the acquisition that we anticipate 
we may encounter the following difficulties  costs  and delays involved in integrating and managing these operations  and the operations of companies we may acquire failure to realize expected synergies  inability to effectively integrate acquired products into our business  failure to successfully manage relationships with customers and other important business partners  failure of customers to continue using the products and services of the combined company  failure to successfully develop the acquired technology into the desired products or enhancements  challenges encountered in managing larger  more geographically dispersed operations  the loss of key employees  assumption of unknown liabilities  failure to understand and compete effectively in markets and with products or technologies with which we have limited previous experience  impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  generated as a result of the acquisition  decreased liquidity  restrictive bank covenants  and incremental financing costs associated with debt we may incur to complete future acquisitions  and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
our acquisitions of products  technology assets  or businesses may have a negative impact on our business if we fail to achieve the anticipated financial  strategic  and other benefits of acquisitions or investments  and our operating results may suffer because of this 
future changes in technology or market conditions could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets  including goodwill  resulting in additional charges that could significantly impact our operating results at december   we had significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events over which we have no control 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products 
any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
our acquisitions have included in process research and development assets ipr d assets for which we hope to generate future cash flows  our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to bring these assets to market through our acquisitions of other businesses  we have acquired ipr d assets from which we hope to generate future cash flows 
there is inherent risk in bringing these ipr d assets to market and we may be 
table of contents unable to realize the full value we have assigned to them 
we may be unable to complete the development of these ipr d assets within a timely manner  or we may encounter technological difficulties that prevent us from completing their development 
if we are unable to derive future revenue from our ipr d assets  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to it or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
failing to enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of those rights 
in the past  we have relied on sales of our newborn screening products for the majority of our revenue  and these products will continue to contribute to a substantial portion of our revenue  a decline in sales of these products could cause our revenue to fall we expect that the revenue from our newborn hearing screening products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for at least the next year 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our newborn hearing screening devices and related supplies  or demand for our newborn hearing screening products  including physician acceptance or the selection of competing products  could cause our revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies  or if reimbursement policies change adversely  we may not be successful marketing and selling new products or technologies clinicians  hospitals  and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies 
unless a sufficient amount of conclusive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may refuse adequate reimbursement unless the patient has demonstrable risk factors 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products  we may not achieve significant market acceptance of our products 
acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding  and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
we may not obtain approvals for reimbursement in a timely manner or at all 
adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business 
we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors  particularly those in countries and regions outside the us for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
in a managed care system the cost of our products may not be incorporated into the overall payment for patient care or there may not be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for other procedures 

table of contents if we fail in our efforts to educate clinicians  government agency personnel  and third party payors on the effectiveness of our products  we will not achieve future sales growth it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators  and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the commercial success of our products depends upon clinician  government agency and other third party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy  reliability  sensitivity and specificity of our products 
we believe that clinicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles and experience  that our products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment 
our customers may choose to use competitive products  which may be less expensive or may provide faster results than our devices 
clinicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices and clinical treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if more clinicians  government agencies and hospital administrators do not adopt our products  we may not maintain profitability 
factors that may adversely affect the medical community s acceptance of our products include publication of clinical study results that demonstrate a lack of efficacy or cost effectiveness of our products  changing governmental and physician group guidelines  performance  quality  price  and total cost of ownership of our products relative to other competitive products  our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians  physician organizations  hospitals  state laboratory personnel  and third party payors  changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for our products  and repeal of laws requiring universal newborn hearing screening and metabolic screening 
increased sales through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenue and gross profits we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts from our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profits to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of group purchasing organizations  or gpos  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to gpo members  the gpo members receive volume discounts from our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us 
sales to members of all gpos accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue during   and  respectively  and sales to members of one gpo  novation llc  accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of gpos with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through gpos may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new gpos and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those gpos  our revenue and profits could decline 
demand for some of our products depends on the capital spending policies of our customers  and changes in these policies could harm our business a majority of customers for our products are hospitals  physician offices  and clinics 
many factors  including public policy spending provisions  available resources  and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities and therefore the amount that they can spend on our equipment products 
if budget resources limit the capital spending of our customers  they will be unlikely to either purchase 
table of contents any new equipment from us or upgrade to any of our newer equipment products 
these factors can have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products 
our markets are very competitive and in the united states we sell certain of our products in a mature market we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small  privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
the markets for certain of our products in the us  including the newborn hearing screening and eeg monitoring markets  are mature and we are unlikely to see significant growth for such products in the us in the us we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our hearing screening devices 
because these disposable supply products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening disposable supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths relate to the functionality and reliability of our products  our recognized brands  and our developed sales channels 
our competitors may have certain competitive advantages  which include the ability to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 
consequently  we may need to increase our efforts  and related expenses for research and development  marketing  and selling to maintain or improve our position 
we expect recurring sales to our existing customers to generate a majority of our revenue in the future  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenue may decline 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional products or improving our existing products we intend to develop and acquire additional products and technologies for the screening  detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments 
developing and acquiring new products  and improving our existing products  to meet the needs of current and future customers requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products  update our existing products  or timely react to changes in technology  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical device vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation large medical device vendors may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors 
we expect that the medical device industry will continue to consolidate 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
our plan to expand our international operations will result in increased costs and is subject to numerous risks  if our efforts are not successful  this could harm our business we plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries 
during the past five years we significantly expanded our distributor network outside the us we may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international unit sales  due to the lower average selling prices we receive on sales outside of the us even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the us our international operations are subject to other risks  which include impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us  
table of contents political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad  contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors  decreased health care spending by foreign governments that would reduce international demand for our produces  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that could make our products less competitive because most of our international sales are denominated in the us dollar  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval  and attitudes by clinicians  and cost reimbursement policies  towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business 
if guidelines mandating universal newborn hearing screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not mandate testing of all newborns as we anticipate  or if those guidelines have a long phase in period  our revenue may be adversely impacted we estimate that approximately of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing impairment prior to discharge from the hospital 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments  and the phase in period generally spans several years 
the widespread adoption of guidelines depends  in part  on our ability to educate foreign government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors  and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn hearing screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 
our revenue from our newborn hearing screening product lines may not grow if governments do not require universal newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge  or if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines  or if governments provide for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in most of our markets outside of the us  our revenue could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the us our reliance on international distributors has increased because of our decisions in and to close our japanese and uk sales subsidiaries and sell through distributors in those countries  and because of our acquisition of fischer zoth  which sells its products through distributors in europe and asia 
we may also sell deltamed products through distributors in countries outside of france and germany 
some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of clinicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan  and other developed countries 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 

table of contents we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our international distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors if we terminate our relationship for any reason  including for cause 
some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supersede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
these payments could be equal to a year or more of gross profit on sales of our products that the distributor would have earned 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may suffer because of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and may require us to engage in foreign currency hedging substantially all of our sales contracts to our us based customers provide for payment in us dollars 
in addition  sales to most of our international distributors provide for payment in us dollars 
however  substantially all of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
to date we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions and  as a result  our future revenue and expenses may be subject to volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the translation of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
we have relatively few sources of supply for some of the components used in our products and in some cases we rely entirely on sole source suppliers 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
for example  during  we experienced delays on the part of a supplier to provide us with volume production of our flexicoupler supplies  and in  we relied on a single supplier of cables used in our algo hearing screening devices to help us complete a field replacement program of those cables 
if these or other suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements  it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner  or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer 
replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional employees  we cannot grow or maintain profitability our products and technologies are complex  and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
our future success also will depend  in part  on the continued service of our key management personnel  software engineers  and other research and development employees and our ability to identify  hire  and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing  and sales staff 
hiring research and development  engineering  sales  marketing and customer service personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our product technologies 
we may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 

table of contents our ability to market and sell products depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
our failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and compliance could negatively affect our business our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration  or the fda  and by similar regulatory agencies in many other countries in which we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we propose to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations clearance via section k of the food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended  or premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s section k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval via section is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
the fda may not grant either section k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain section k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval via section the fda may impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
domestic regulation of our products and manufacturing operations  other than that which is administered by the fda  includes the environmental protection act  the occupational safety and health act  and state and local counterparts to these acts 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for section k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawal of section k clearance or premarket approvals already granted  or criminal prosecution 
we have received clearance from the fda to market a new product that will potentially expose us to greater products liability exposure and fda regulation in december we received clearance from the fda to market the olympic cool cap  a product designed to lower the cerebral temperature of children born with a particular medical condition 
this product is a class iii minimally invasive medical device  and as such we may be subject to an increased product liability risk relative to our other  class i and class ii non invasive products 
in addition  this type of product is subject to greater fda oversight than our other products and there is greater risk that sales of the product could be interrupted  due to the oversight processes of the fda and other regulatory bodies 

table of contents our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials  or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we are prohibited by the fda from promoting or advertising our medical device products for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals  or from making unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances  or are unsupported  it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenue could decline  and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
if we  or our suppliers  fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenue could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including natus and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
we  or our contract manufacturers  may fail to pass future quality system regulation inspections 
if we  or our contract manufacturers  fail one of these inspections in the future  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing and sales delayed significantly until we demonstrate adequate compliance 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulation inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations or require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim the medical technology industry has  in the past  been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we expect that medical screening and diagnostic products may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or suspensions  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of infringement against us could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition 
our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  or design and build non infringing products  could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results 
we license intellectual property rights from third parties and would be adversely affected if our licensors do not appropriately defend their proprietary rights or if we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others we license rights from third parties for products and technology that are important to our business 
if our licensors are unsuccessful in asserting and defending their proprietary rights  including patent rights and trade secrets  we may lose the competitive advantages we have through selling products that we license from third parties 
additionally  if it is found that our licensors infringe on the proprietary rights of others  we may be prohibited from marketing our existing products that incorporate those proprietary rights 
under our licenses  we 
table of contents are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  or otherwise breach a license agreement  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages  and an increase in our insurance rates the sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business reputation or financial condition 
our product liability insurance may not protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
we have a history of losses  variable quarterly results  and seasonality in the sale of our products  and may not maintain profitability in the future since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  including net losses for the years and  and we may incur net losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
additionally  our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter budgeting cycle of our customers  particularly government entities  size and timing of specific sales  such as large purchases of our devices and systems or our supplies and services by government agencies or hospital systems  trade in allowances or other concessions in connection with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products  length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  and market changes caused by rapidly evolving technology 
in addition  we experience seasonality in our revenue 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter  due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations  which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
we believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period 
we anticipate that it will become increasingly difficult for us to manage our expenses as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product lines  including products and technologies we have gained through our acquisitions  develop additional applications for our current technology  increase our marketing and selling activities  particularly outside the us  and develop additional infrastructure and hire required management and other employees to keep pace with our growth 
as a result of these factors  we may need to generate proportionately higher revenue to maintain profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 

table of contents we could lose the ability to use net operating loss and credit carryforwards  which may adversely affect our financial results as of december   we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and credit carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income 
these net operating loss and credit carryforwards  if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  will expire in various amounts beginning in in addition  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs  and are thus subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
if we are unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  our future tax payments could be higher and our financial condition may suffer

business natus provides healthcare products used for the screening  detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments such as hearing impairment  neurological dysfunction  epilepsy  sleep disorders  and newborn care 
we develop  manufacture  and market advanced neurodiagnostic and newborn care products to healthcare professionals 
our product offerings include computerized neurodiagnostic systems for audiology  neurology  polysomnography  and neonatology  as well as newborn care products such as hearing screening systems  phototherapy devices for the treatment of newborn jaundice  head cooling products for the treatment of brain injury in newborns  and software systems for managing and tracking disorders and diseases for public health laboratories 
we design our products to deliver accurate results in a rapid and reliable manner 
in addition  our products address guidelines for standard medical practices as adopted by various medical industry associations such as the american academy of pediatrics aap and the joint committee on infant hearing jcih 
our principal product families and product lines consist of newborn hearing screening

our revenue is generated almost exclusively from the sale of devices and systems  which are generally non recurring  and related supplies and services  which are generally recurring 
the sources of our revenue from devices and systems  and related supplies and services  are covered in item to this annual report on form k 

table of contents we sell our products in the united states primarily through a direct sales organization 
through our acquisition of bio logic in january  we now offer our line of diagnostic hearing products in the us primarily through distributors  we also sell certain products under private label arrangements 
we sell our products outside the us primarily through a distributor sales channel  which consists of distributors selling natus products into more than countries as of december  through our acquisition of deltamed in september  we sell some of our products in france and germany through a direct sales organization 
we previously had direct sales organizations in japan and the united kingdom uk 
however  in we ceased selling through a direct sales force in japan and began to sell through a distributor  and in february we ceased selling through a direct sales force in the uk and began to sell through a distributor 
revenue from direct sales in our international markets represents less than of total revenue 
we intend to continue expansion of our international operations because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
international sales made to distributors are characterized by lower gross profits due to the discount from our list prices that the distributors receive 
international sales contributed to of our revenue during  compared to of our revenue during the reduction in international sales as a percent of total sales in compared to was attributable to our acquisition of bio logic  as their international sales comprise a lower percentage of their total sales than natus 
we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percent of revenue in the future 
we estimate that approximately of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing prior to discharge from the hospital 
as such  the us market is a mature and competitive market 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
because these products can generate high margins  we may face increasing competition 
we believe that our primary competitive advantage relates to the functionality and reliability of our products and that other suppliers may compete against us by offering lower prices 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by our decisions regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management and our board of directors make these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions  and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 
year overview in january we acquired bio logic systems corp bio logic for million pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  we used million of bio logic cash to fund the acquisition 
bio logic  which traded on the nasdaq national market under the ticker blsc  reported revenue of million and net income of million  for the year ended february  in january we initiated an integration plan the plan related to the acquisition of bio logic 
under the plan  we reduced our combined workforce by employees or of our workforce 
the objectives of the plan were to eliminate redundant costs and improve efficiency 
total employee severance costs related to the staff reductions were million  including costs related to change of control provisions in the employment contracts of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  and two vice presidents of bio logic totaling million 
during the first quarter we began marketing the latest extension of our product line for the treatment of newborn jaundice 
the neoblue cozy provides a light treatment source from underneath the baby  utilizing the same blue light emitting diodes leds used in our line of neoblue overhead phototherapy lights 
in march we partnered with welch allyn  inc  a leading manufacturer of frontline medical products and solutions  to market an innovative hearing loss detection solution that will improve clinical efficiencies by allowing pediatricians to objectively screen for hearing loss in infants  toddlers  preschool  and school age children 

table of contents in august we issued  shares of our stock in a registered offering priced at per share  raising million after deducting costs associated with the offering 
in september we completed the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land we obtained through our acquisition of bio logic 
the sale of land had no impact on our results of operations  however  we netted approximately million cash through the sale 
in september we acquired deltamed sa deltamed for cash of million cash and in october we acquired olympic medical corp olympic for million including the immediate satisfaction of million dollars of olympic obligations associated with the acquisition 
olympic has approximately employees and recorded sales of million during calendar year in december we received premarket approval from the fda to market our olympic cool cap  a class iii medical device 
the cool cap system  which is the only fda approved device for the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy hie in term newborns  provides selective head cooling to prevent or reduce the severity of neurologic injury associated with hie 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb  statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on january  during we expensed million of share based compensation expense  which increased our net loss per share by 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates of america gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective and  consequently  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from sales of medical devices and supplies  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of certain eeg and psg systems is recognized in accordance with fasb statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  wherein revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
set up and training revenue related to system sales is not recognized until the service is completed 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
terms of sale for most domestic sales are fob origin  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser at the shipping point  however  terms of sale for some neurology and sleep diagnostic systems are fob destination  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser upon delivery 
terms of sales to international distributors are exw  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations of one year  and post sale training and customer support at the time the related revenue is recognized 

table of contents more than of the hospitals in the us are members of gpos  which negotiate volume purchase prices for member hospitals  group practices  and other clinics 
we have entered into agreements with several gpos that typically contain preferential terms for the gpo and its members  including provisions for some  if not all  of the following negotiated pricing for all group members  volume discounts and other preferential terms on their member s direct purchases from us  promotion of natus products by the gpo to its members  payment of marketing fees by natus to the gpo  usually based on purchasing experience of group members  and non recourse cancellation provisions 
we do not sell our products to gpos 
hospitals  group practices and other clinics that are members of a gpo purchase products directly from us under the terms negotiated by the gpo 
negotiated pricing and discounts are recognized as a reduction of the selling price of our products 
revenue from sales to gpo members is otherwise consistent with our general revenue recognition policies as previously described 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate  assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days  and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is not properly stated could result in a change in our operating expense and results of operations 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or being held in quantities that exceed anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
carrying value of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them 
any future determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
we test our definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant 
table of contents underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of october st of each year  this assessment is also performed whenever there is a change in circumstances that indicates the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to the basis of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize subjective valuations based upon discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and costs  and appropriate discount rates 
liability for product warranties our medical device products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our medical device products during these service periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
until we have historical experience of the cost to honor warranties on new products  we base additions to the reserve on a combination of factors including the standard cost of the product  experience with similar products  and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating profits and results of operations 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the provision of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective approach 
with the adoption of sfas r  the company is required to record the fair value of share based compensation awards as expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term  and forfeiture rate 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility  expected life  and forfeiture rate assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
following is a summary of the criteria the company considers when making these estimates expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of the company s common stock  measured by reference to the average of the high and low price of the stock on the same day of each week 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options  as the company does not currently expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among its employee population 
the company uses the simplified method for calculating expected term allowed by sab no 
share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company bases its pre vesting forfeiture rate on weighted average historical forfeiture rates 
under the provisions of sfas r  the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated  and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than estimated 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

operating results we analyze our revenue from two perspectives 
because our acquisitions have been significant  we measure the contribution of the businesses we acquired in to consolidated revenue for the year 
we also analyze our revenue as coming from two sources sales of devices and systems  and sales of related supplies and services 
we report freight revenue separate from these two sources 
our revenue increased  or million  to million in  from million in bio logic contributed to million of our revenue  which amount represents an increase over bio logic s stand alone revenue of million for the twelve months ended december  deltamed and olympic contributed to million of our revenue in 
table of contents revenue from devices and systems was million in  representing an increase of or million  from million reported in revenue from supplies and services was million in  representing an increase of or million  from million in revenue from devices and systems was of total revenue in  compared to in  and revenue from supplies and services was of total revenue in compared to of revenue in the changes in the percentages from to resulted primarily from the contribution of bio logic 
freight revenue of million in represented of total revenue  while freight revenue of  in represented of total revenue

revenue from supplies and services increased million  or  to million in  from million in substantially all of our revenue increases mentioned above  and in the narrative to follow  were from increased unit sales of our products  as average selling prices remained relatively stable among most of our product lines

the effect of the operating cost reduction plan resulted in decreases in our operating costs in compared to  as more fully described below 
in addition  we incurred costs in that did not recur in related to the restructuring  the write off of acquired in process research and development  and costs associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer

liquidity and capital resources comparison of and liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million  compared with cash  cash 
table of contents equivalents  and short term investments of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million as of december  the reduction in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily related to our acquisitions of bio logic  deltamed  and olympic 
in january we acquired bio logic for million cash  in september we acquired deltamed for million cash  and in october  we acquired olympic for million cash  plus the immediate satisfaction of approximately million of obligations associated with the acquisition 
in august  we issued  shares of our common stock in a registered offering 
the offering was priced at per share  which was the closing price of our stock on the day prior to the offering 
we raised million  net of underwriting fees and other costs of the offering 
on november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility and transferred the outstanding balance of an existing term credit facility to the revolving facility 
we repaid the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility later in november the proceeds of advances on the revolving credit facility can be used for working capital needs 
in addition  we can use up to million of the commitment for the acquisition of businesses without prior approval of wells fargo 
the revolving credit facility carries an unused commitment fee  and contains covenants  including covenants relating to liquidity and other financial measurements and provides for events of default  including failure to pay any interest when due  failure to perform or observe covenants  bankruptcy or insolvency events and the occurrence of a material adverse effect 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants of the revolving credit facility and there was no outstanding balance 
following our acquisitions of bio logic  deltamed  and olympic  our cash reserves and working capital have been significantly reduced 
however  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant 
these actions would likely affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increase our cost of capital 
net cash provided by operations was million in compared to net cash provided by operations of million in cash provided by operation in was largely attributable to our net loss for the year offset by substantial non cash charges for in process research and development  and depreciation and amortization 
additionally  during the period  the company assumed accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  associated with the bio logic and olympic acquisitions that were paid off shortly after the acquisitions were consummated 
the reduction of these accrued liabilities reduced cash provided by operations by million in increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and accounts payable of million  million  and million  respectively  were largely the result of our acquisitions 
other than million of the company s cash used to acquire bio logic  deltamed  the nascor assets  and olympic  offset by sales of short term investments  cash used in investing activities in was million  primarily to acquire equipment  offset by proceeds from the sale of land of million and a reduction in deposits and other assets 
in  we used  for earnout payments associated with our pervious acquisitions and  for purchases equipment for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in during we raised million in a registered common stock offering  and during we raised million in a private placement of our stock 
other sources of cash from financing activities were primarily from exercises of stock options pursuant to our stock option plans and purchases of our stock by 
table of contents employee pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of million and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during we also realized an excess tax benefit of million on the exercise of employee stock options that was recorded as an increase to stockholders equity 
comparison of and net cash provided by operations increased by million to million in from million in the increase was favorably impacted by our results of operations  as we reported net income of million for the year  compared to a net loss of million reported in in addition  a reduction in inventories and an increase in accrued liabilities together provided an additional million in  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
our accounts receivable increased because sales in the fourth quarter of were approximately million greater than in excluding purchases and sales of short term investments  cash used in investing activities decreased by million  to million in  from million in in we paid  in additional purchase consideration related to our acquisition of fischer zoth  pursuant to earnout provisions of the purchase agreement 
in  we acquired fischer zoth for million  net of cash acquired 
investment in capital assets of  in was approximately  less than the amount invested in our short term investments are primarily available for sale securities with maturities of less than one year  and fluctuations between cash equivalents and short term investments are often attributable to investment decisions 
we exclude the impact of purchases and sales of short term investments in our analysis of cash provided by or used in investing activities 
related to our acquisitions of fischer zoth and neometrics are the potential for additional purchase consideration to be paid subject to these business lines achieving certain financial goals 
the company believes the additional purchase consideration to be paid in the future will not exceed million  a portion of which is denominated in euro 
if paid  the additional purchase consideration will be paid out over periods through december  net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  to million in  from million in in anticipation of our acquisition of bio logic  we raised million in a private placement of our common stock in october at the then current trading price for our shares 
we also generated cash from financing activities in both and through purchases of our stock pursuant to our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
future liquidity our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments result primarily from firm  noncancellable purchase orders placed with contract 
table of contents vendors that manufacture some of the components used in our medical devices and related disposable supply products  as well as commitments for leased office  manufacturing  and warehouse facilities 
on november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility  although there was no outstanding principal due under the facility at december  the impact that our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations total unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to purchase orders placed with our suppliers for materials used in our production processes 
the table above does not include obligations under employment agreements for services rendered in the normal course of business 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the u 
s and europe and sell those products primarily in the us  europe  and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars and euros 
with the acquisition of fischer zoth in september and deltamed in september  a portion of our sales are now denominated in the euro 
as our sales in currencies other than the us dollar increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 
if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments and cash equivalents 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 
the fair value of our short term investments and cash equivalents is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
at december  we did not hold any short term investments or cash equivalents with maturities greater than days 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 

table of contents we invest our excess cash in short term investments and cash equivalent investments because our intent is to have cash resources available for potential acquisitions of additional technologies  products  or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant
