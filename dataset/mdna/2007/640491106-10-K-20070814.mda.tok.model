critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates  including those related to receivable allowances  inventories and intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally at the time of shipment 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowance management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information  such as changes in overall changes in customer credit and general credit conditions 
actual collections can differ from historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 
inventory a reserve for obsolescence is established based on an analysis of the inventory taking into account the current condition of the asset as well as other known facts and future plans 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 

table of contents valuation of intangible assets and goodwill management assesses goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment on no less often than an annual basis 
this test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and it was determined that no impairment exists 
there was also no impairment indicated for or in the event of changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  management will make an assessment at any time 
factors that could cause an impairment review to take place would include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the use of acquired assets or strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets is compared to the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
if the carrying amounts of these assets are not recoverable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  such assets are reduced by the estimated shortfall of fair value to recorded value 
changes to the discount rate or projected cash flows used in the analysis can have a significant impact on the results of the impairment test 
stock options at may   the company had stock option plans  which are described more fully in note effective june   the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
the revised statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant date fair value and recognize that cost over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options  typically the vesting period 
the company adopted the provisions of the revised statement using the modified retrospective transition method provided in the revised statement 
under this method  the company restated all prior periods presented on a consistent basis  based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed 
prior to the adoption of the revised statement  the company presented all of the income tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the revised statement requires the income tax benefit from deductions  resulting from the exercise of stock options  in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess income tax benefit to be classified as cash flows provided by financing activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has moderate interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure and no long term fixed rate investments or borrowings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is due to potential fluctuations of interest rates for variable rate borrowings 
because neogen markets and sells its products throughout the world  it could be affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce the demand for its products 
sales in certain foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and euro 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
neogen has asset  liabilities and operations outside of the united states that are located primarily in ayr  scotland where the functional currency is the british pound 
the company s investment in its foreign subsidiary is considered long term  accordingly  it does not hedge the net investment or engage in other foreign currency hedging activities due to the insignificance of these balances to the company as a whole
