critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided 
medicare and medicaid revenues represented  and of our net patient 
table of contents revenues during  and  respectively 
revenues from managed care entities  including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third party payors and others for services rendered 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information  patient utilization data  government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations 
the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term 
certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital  medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements 
such amounts are included in accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes 
as such  we can not make any assurance that future legislation and regulations  if enacted  will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts favorably impacted our after tax operating results by million million pre tax and did not materially impact our operating results in or a adjustment to our estimated net revenues recorded in connection with medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december   would change our after tax net income by approximately million 
on january   we implemented a formal company wide uninsured discount policy which has had the effect of lowering both net revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts by million during the implementation of this discount policy did not have a significant impact on net income during the year ended december  we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts  based on charges at established rates  amounting to amounts include uninsured discounts mentioned above million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at our acute care facilities  medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third party payors but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payors such as county indigent programs in certain states 
approximately or million as of december  and or million as of december  of our accounts receivable  net  were comprised of medicaid pending accounts 
our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration 
at that time  an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned 
there are various pre established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine 
table of contents the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered 
certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration if we are unable to definitively determine if they are medicaid eligible without further evaluation 
when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending  our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s medicaid eligibility 
based on historical hindsight information related to medicaid pending accounts  we estimate that approximately or million of million total medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  will subsequently qualify for medicaid pending reimbursement 
approximately or million of the million total medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  subsequently qualified for medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration 
in  an additional charity reserve of million was established to cover the medicaid pending patients that failed to qualify for the medicaid program based on historical conversion rates 
based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts  our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending  as well as other accounts receivable payor classifications  are considered when the overall individual facility and company wide reserves are developed 
below are the medicaid pending receivable agings as of december  and amounts in thousands under days days days over days total provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility  primarily co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
at our acute care hospitals  third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account 
for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients  the patient is sent at least two statements followed by a series of collection letters 
if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay  the account is written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort 
patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for write off as potential charity care 
our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of million as of december  including the million additional charity care reserved established during as discussed above in revenue recognition and million as of december  uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least of total charges 
during the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay balances outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
all self pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past days from the date of discharge 
potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay 

table of contents on a consolidated basis  we monitor our total self pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience 
at december  and december   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
approximately during  during and during  of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts  was incurred by our acute care hospitals 
shown below is our payor mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  for our acute care hospitals as of december  and excludes facilities reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total self insured risks we provide for self insured risks  primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims  based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims  which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims  and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments 
all relevant information  including our own historical experience  the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents  and independent actuarial analyses of this information  is used in estimating the expected amount of claims 
we also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers  state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk 
our estimated self insured reserves are reviewed and changed  if necessary  at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense 
current period adjustments to our reserves for self insured general and professional and workers compensation claims relating to prior periods did not have a material impact on our financial statements during  or 
table of contents below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended december  amount in thousands general and professional liability workers compensation total balance at january  a plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid less payments made in settlement of self insured claims balance at january  a plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid less payments made in settlement of self insured claims plus liabilities assumed at acquisition balance at january  a adjustment to liabilities assumed at acquisition plus accrued insurance expense  net of commercial premiums paid less payments made in settlement of self insured claims balance at december  a a net of expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds  insurance companies and other sources in connection with phico related professional and general liability claims payments 
in addition  we also maintain self insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims 
the ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
we have designated september st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september   which indicated no impairment of goodwill 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including profitability and market value projections  could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
we are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities 
during  we recorded a favorable non cash adjustment to reduce tax reserves in the amount of million due to expiration of statute of limitations in a foreign jurisdiction 
our tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the year ended december  we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal  foreign and state taxes

 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

table of contents an increase to supplies expense of approximately million or basis points calculated as a percentage of our same facility acute care net revenues shown above  an increase to salaries  wages and benefits expense of approximately million or basis points and a decrease to other operating expenses of approximately million or basis points 
the transition of our pharmacy services did not have a significant impact on our same facility acute care net income during we continue to experience an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part  has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance 
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts  based on charges at established rates  amounting to million during and million during during the past several years  the operating results of our acute care facilities located in the mcallen edinburg  texas market have been pressured by continued intense hospital and physician competition as a physician owned hospital in the market has eroded a portion of our higher margin business  including cardiac procedures 
in response to these competitive pressures  we have undertaken significant capital investment in the market  including edinburg children s hospital  a new dedicated bed children s facility  which was completed and opened in march   as well as south texas behavioral health center  a bed replacement behavioral facility  which was completed and opened in late june  the financial results for the edinburg children s hospital and south texas behavioral health center are included in the same facility financial results presented above

we expect the competitive pressures in the market to continue and potentially intensify if additional capacity is added to the market in future periods by our competitors 
the operating factors mentioned above have resulted in a certain degree of volatility in our income from continuing operations 
although we have undertaken actions in regards to physician recruitment and other measures as mentioned above in the mcallen edinburg market  the ultimate impact and timing of potential improvements in the operating results of the facilities in the market are beyond our ability to predict 
a continuation of the unfavorable operating results experienced in this market and or a continuation of the increased level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided  could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results

hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services 
charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg  medical surgical  intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years  primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  as well as increased pressure from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to 
table of contents reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurance plans  and managed care plans  but are responsible for services not covered by such plans  exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has generally been increasing each year 
indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided 
the following table shows the approximate percentages of net patient revenue on a combined basis for our acute care and behavioral health facilities during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements

medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
under the medicare program  for inpatient services  our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system pps 
under inpatient pps  hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge 
the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s diagnosis related group drg 
every drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
the drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care 
this drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each drg 
the drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity 
drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the index used to adjust the drg rates  known as the hospital market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services 
generally  however  the percentage increases in the drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
for federal fiscal years  and  the update factors were  and  respectively 
for  the update factor is 
hospitals are allowed to receive the full basket update if they provide the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms with specific data relating to the quality of services provided 
we have complied fully with this requirement and intend to comply fully in future periods 
in august  cms finalized new provisions for the hospital inpatient pps for the upcoming federal fiscal year  which includes a significant change in the manner in which it determines the underlying relative weights used to calculate the drg payment amount 
for federal fiscal year  cms has begun to phase in the use of hospital costs rather than hospital charges for the drg relative weight determination 
this change will phase in ratably over three years with full phase in to be completed in federal fiscal year in the same final rule  in federal fiscal year  cms expanded the number of medicare drgs from to as part of this drg expansion  cms identified new drgs involving different clinical areas that attempt to significantly improve the cms drg system s recognition of severity of illness 
the final rule also modifies existing drgs in an attempt to better capture differences in severity  and deletes existing drgs 
similarly  cms has stated it will conduct through a research contractor an evaluation of alternative drg severity systems and implement one of these systems  or potentially a system that cms develops based on its own prior research  in the hope of achieving further improvements in payment accuracy by federal fiscal year the final rule omitted the publication of federal fiscal year wage index values which are used to adjust hospital drg payments based on their geographic location 
the omission of these wage index values was the result of a federal court order to cms to collect current data for the medicare occupational mix adjustment and apply it at rather than at its current weighting of 
subsequently  cms published this wage index data in september  based upon our estimates  the impact of the standard annual wage index update and the change in occupational mix weighting will reduce our medicare acute care inpatient net revenue by less than 
we estimate that our federal fiscal year average drg payment rates will increase approximately to when factoring in all published medicare federal fiscal year inpatient drg rule changes and update factors 

table of contents for the majority of outpatient hospital services  both general acute and behavioral health hospitals are paid under an outpatient pps according to ambulatory procedure codes apc that group together services that are clinically related and use similar resources 
depending on the service rendered during an encounter  a patient may be assigned to a single or multiple groups 
medicare pays a set price or rate for each group  regardless of the actual costs incurred in providing care 
medicare sets the payment rate for each apc based on historical median cost data  subject to geographic modification 
the apc payment rates are updated each federal fiscal year 
for  and  the payment rate update factors were  and  respectively 
for  the update factor is 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospital units that treat medicare patients with specific medical conditions which are excluded from the medicare inpatient pps drg payment methodology 
inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs must meet a certain volume threshold each year for the number patients with these specific medical conditions  often referred to as the percent rule 
medicare payment for irf patients is based on a prospective case rate based on a cms determined case mix group classification and is updated annually by cms 
cms has temporarily reduced the irf qualifying threshold from to in  in and in before returning to the threshold in psychiatric hospitals have traditionally been excluded from the inpatient services pps 
however  on january   cms implemented a new pps psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program 
this system replaced the cost based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics 
psych pps also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full service emergency department 
the new system is being phased in over a three year period 
also  cms has included a stop loss provision to ensure that hospitals avoid significant losses during the transition 
in may  cms published its annual increase to the federal component of the psych pps per diem rate 
this increase includes the effects of market basket updates resulting in a increase in total payments for rate year  covering the period of july  to june  we believe the continued phase in of psych pps will have a favorable effect on our future results of operations  however  due to the three year phase in period  we do not believe the favorable effect will have a material impact on our results of operations 
medicaid medicaid is a joint federal state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps like system  or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program  we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from pennsylvania  washington  dc and illinois 
we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in the above mentioned states  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
furthermore  the federal government and many states are currently working to effectuate significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
in february   a texas medicaid state plan amendment went into effect for potter county that expands the supplemental inpatient reimbursement methodology for the state s medicaid program 
this state plan amendment was approved retroactively to march  in  and  we earned million  million and million  respectively  of revenue in connection with this program 
for the remainder of the state fiscal year sfy covering the period of january  through august   our total supplemental payments pursuant to the provisions of this program are estimated to be approximately million 

table of contents during the remainder of  covering a portion of the sfy covering the period of september  to december   our estimated revenues earned pursuant to this program could range from zero to million depending on the ability of the local hospital district to make inter governmental transfers igts to the state of texas 
we are unable to predict whether the hospital district will fund the igts at a level in sfy above the minimum range 
on july   cms retroactively approved to june   an amendment to the texas medicaid state plan which permits the state of texas to make supplemental payments to certain hospitals located in hidalgo  maverick and webb counties 
our four acute care hospital facilities located in these counties are eligible to receive these supplemental medicaid payments 
this program is subject to final state rule making procedures and the local governmental agencies providing the necessary funds on an ongoing basis through inter governmental transfers to the state of texas 
in and  we earned million and million  respectively  of revenues in connection with this program 
we estimate that our hospitals will be entitled to reimbursements of approximately million annually 
in september  legislation in texas went into effect that ensures that some form of medicaid managed care will exist in every texas county 
in addition  the texas star plus program  which provides an integrated acute and long term care medicaid managed care delivery system to elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries in the harris county service area will be expanded to seven additional service areas 
such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the reimbursement our texas hospitals receive 
also included in our financial results during was million in non recurring medicaid payments from texas for a sfy state wide upper payment limit upl medicaid payment program 
this upl program was not renewed by texas beyond the sfy we operate two freestanding psychiatric hospitals in the dallas  texas region that operated under the lone star select ii prospective per diem payment program 
we were notified by the commission that this per diem payment program terminated on august  these affected facilities were paid on a tefra cost based payment system for september and october of effective november   the commission s payment for these hospitals is based on a prospective per diem rate based on a prior year cost report 
managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies  which include health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage 
in general  we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate 
typically  we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers  however  during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies 
commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including predetermined payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals 

table of contents other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage 
such patients are evaluated  at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines  qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our local hospital s indigent and charity care policy 
patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances 
in addition  effective january   we implemented a formal uninsured discount policy for our acute care hospitals which had the effect of lowering both our provision for doubtful accounts and net revenues but did not materially impact net income 
state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of low income patients ie  those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization  or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment 
congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments 
although this legislation and the resulting state broad based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program  to date the net impact has not been materially adverse 
upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolina s low income patients  five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s dsh fund 
the texas and south carolina programs have been renewed for each state s fiscal years covering the period of september  through august  for texas and october  through september  for south carolina 
although neither state has definitively quantified the amount of dsh funding our facilities will receive during the sfy  both states have indicated the allocation criteria will be similar to the methodology used in previous years 
included in our financial results was an aggregate of million during  million during and million during from these programs 
failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates  failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs  or reductions in reimbursements  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in february  the united states department of health and human services hhs office of inspector general oig published a report indicating that texas medicaid may have overpaid texas hospitals for dsh payments 
to date  no actions to follow up on this report have had any material impact on our texas hospitals 
sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits  the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding  which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of  among other things  the ongoing military engagement in iraq  the war on terrorism  economic recovery stimulus packages  responses to natural disasters  such as hurricane katrina  the continuing expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs  our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings  new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations  post payment audits  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities 
the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments 
nevertheless  until final adjustments are made  certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 

table of contents finally  we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations

included in our financial results were after tax hurricane related insurance recoveries amounting to million million pre tax and pre minority interest during and million million pre tax and pre minority interest during professional and general liability claims and property insurance effective january   most of our subsidiaries became self insured for malpractice exposure up to million per occurrence  as compared to million per occurrence in the prior year 
we purchased several excess policies for our subsidiaries through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of million per occurrence with a million total aggregate 
we also purchased a commercial excess policy with a million limit for our subsidiaries for professional and general liability exposure in excess of million per occurrence 

table of contents our estimated liability for self insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including  among other things  the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies 
while we continuously monitor these factors  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate 
given our significant self insured exposure for professional and general liability claims  there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
for the period from january  through december   most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with phico  a pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation during the first quarter of as a result of phico s liquidation  we recorded a million pre tax charge during to reserve for phico claims that became our liability 
however  we continue to be entitled to receive reimbursement from state insurance guaranty funds and or phico s estate for a portion of certain claims ultimately paid by us 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million million net of expected recoveries  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million million net of expected recoveries  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
included in other assets was million as of december  and million as of december   related to estimated expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds in connection with phico related professional and general liability claims payments 
prior to  we had commercial insurance policies for a large portion of our property loss exposure which provided coverage with varying sub limits and aggregates for property and business interruption losses resulting from damage sustained from fire  flood  windstorm and earthquake 
the specific amount of commercial insurance coverage was dependent on factors such as location of the facility and loss causation 
due to a sharp increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years  the cost of commercial property insurance has increased significantly 
as a result  catastrophic coverage for flood and earthquake has been limited to annual aggregate losses  windstorms have been limited to per occurrence losses and coverage has been limited to lower sub limits for named windstorms and earthquakes in certain states such as alaska  california  puerto rico and washington and for floods in facilities located in designated flood zones 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality our business is typically seasonal  with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality occurs because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months 
inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to continue to cover future cost increases  we believe that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  
table of contents the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
however  our ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited
