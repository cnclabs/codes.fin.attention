off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year  our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimate of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
consolidation of limited partnerships as of september   we operate seven restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants  excluding the pembroke pines  florida and davie  florida limited partnership restaurants

in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year other matters impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  beverage and labor costs
