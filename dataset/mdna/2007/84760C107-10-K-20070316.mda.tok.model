item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system for use with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers relatively cool ultraviolet energy to ablate or remove arterial blockages including plaque  calcium and thrombus 
our laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various disposable fiber optic laser catheters 
our laser catheters contain hundreds of small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
we believe that our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures 
these procedures include atherectomy  which is a procedure to remove arterial blockages in the peripheral and coronary vasculature  and the removal of infected  defective or abandoned cardiac lead wires from patients with pacemakers or icds  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
as of december   our worldwide installed base of laser systems was  of which were in the united states 
we are focused on increasing recurring revenue  which includes disposable catheter sales  service and laser rental  which in the aggregate represented of our revenue for disposable catheter sales represented of our revenue for loss before income taxes was  for the year ended december   compared with income before income taxes  for the year ended december  an increase in revenue primarily due to increased sales of our clirpath atherectomy products for use in the peripheral vasculature system was partially offset by increased operating expenses related to the overall growth of our business 
additionally  the decrease in pre tax income was due to our adoption of statement r  which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and to record that expense in their financial statements 
in  we recorded stock compensation expense of  no stock compensation expense was recorded in prior to the adoption of fas r which was effective

financial results by geographical segment in thousands revenue united states europe total revenue in thousands net loss income united states europe total net loss income results for includes an income tax benefit of  related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of  which represented our best estimate of the amount of our deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized through the reduction of income taxes payable in future years 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue during the year ended december  was  an increase of compared with  during the year ended december   as a result of increased revenue in all revenue categories  but driven primarily by growth in disposable products revenue 
disposable products revenue was  for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of  during the same period in we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories atherectomy and lead removal 
for the year ended december   our atherectomy revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
atherectomy revenue  which includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system  grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with atherectomy revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our clirpath product line since its launch in may  following the april fda clearance to market these products to treat total occlusions in the legs that are not crossable with a guidewire 
approximately of the atherectomy revenue growth compared with the prior year was due to unit price increases related to our clirpath turbo product line  the launch of which was completed in the second quarter of additionally  our quick cross support catheters contributed to the atherectomy revenue growth  accounting for of the growth 
atherectomy revenue growth from current levels will depend on our ability to increase market acceptance of the clirpath product line and our ability to continue to increase the worldwide installed base of lasers  as well 
table of contents as the future success of our ongoing clinical research and product development within the coronary and peripheral atherectomy markets 
lead removal revenue grew during compared with we continue to believe our lead removal revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
when an icd is implanted  it often replaces a pacemaker 
in these cases  the old pacemaker leads may be removed to minimize the potential for venous obstruction when the new icd leads are implanted 
recent clinical studies multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial ii  or madit ii  and sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial  or scdheft have shown results expanding the patient population that may benefit from defibrillator implants 
the results of the madit clinical trial became available in and the scd heft clinical trial results were made public in march growth in the icd market may accelerate  depending on the establishment of referral patterns to electrophysiologists for this expanded patient pool and the additional reimbursement recently established for the hospitals and electrophysiologists who treat these patients  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  growth in the implantable defibrillator market contributes to growth in our lead removal business 
although we expect our lead removal business to continue to grow  there can be no assurances to that effect 
the current standard of care in this market is to cap leads and leave them in the body rather than to remove them 
we have initiated programs to examine the costs and frequency of complications associated with abandoned leads  but there are no assurances that these programs will be successful or will change the current standard of care 
laser equipment revenue in was  compared with  in  which represents an increase of 
as of december  our worldwide installed base of laser systems was in the united states compared with in the united states as of december  this represents new laser placements in of laser systems compared to new laser systems placed during the increase in laser placements in is largely driven by customer interest in our clirpath product line used for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
data as to our installed base of laser systems and new laser placements includes outright sales  rentals and lasers being evaluated during a trial period by potential purchasers 
laser sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  increased to  for as compared to  for the increase was due to the sale of six additional units  partially offset by a decrease in average sale prices for the units sold due to a higher mix of rental evaluation conversions as compared to sales from inventory 
rental revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for  due mainly to an increase in systems placed with customers under our various rental programs  particularly our cap free program  which was introduced in the second quarter of most of the increase in our laser system placements from to related to systems placed under our cap free and evergreen rental program  as opposed to outright sales  and we expect in that the large majority of our new laser placements will continue to be under the cap free program 
we believe that laser system placements is a more relevant metric for measuring our progress within the equipment business  as it represents new customers that have elected to acquire or are considering the acquisition of a laser system  whether it be from an outright sale from inventory  or an evaluation or rental program 
the laser system placement represents an opportunity to sell our higher margin disposable products 
service and other revenue of  during increased from  for service and other revenue is generated through the repair and maintenance services offered to our customers and is associated exclusively with our laser systems 
the growth in service and other revenue is a result of an increase in our installed base 
gross profit decreased to as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  as compared with during the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to an increase in manufacturing personnel  equipment and related costs targeted at raising production capacity 
additionally  an increase in lower margin capfree program revenue also had a negative effect on overall gross margins 
this was partially offset by an increase in unit prices related to our clirpath turbo product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared with  in approximately  of the increase relates to stock 
table of contents compensation expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expense for the first time in upon the adoption of fas r as of january  the remainder of increase is due to the following selling expenses increased approximately  due to the following factors approximately  relates to personnel related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees in within our sales organization 
these increased costs include salaries and benefits  recruiting and travel costs 
an additional  of the increase relates to higher commissions expense as a result of our increased revenue compared with the prior year 
additional convention  meeting and education costs  primarily the result of attendance at an increasing number of tradeshows and conventions  combined with additional physician training costs incurred primarily in peer to peer clinical training sessions  accounted for approximately  of the increase 
increased expenses associated with the operations of spectranetics international  bv  our wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands that serves the european market represented approximately  of the increase 
the majority of this increase relates to costs associated with the hiring of five additional employees for the european sales organization and for the payment of additional commissions on increased sales in europe for as compared to approximately  of the increase relates to an additional reserve recorded by the company related to the settlement of the krauth matter  which is discussed in note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
approximately  of the increase relates to increased materials and supplies costs consumed by our various sales and marketing departments 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  as a result of increased personnel related costs of approximately  associated with increased staffing

interest expense of  for the year ended december  was entirely related to interest which was awarded to edwards lifesciences by an arbitrator s decision in a royalty dispute case that is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
no interest expense was recorded in for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of  compared to income tax expense of  for the prior year 
we recorded income tax expense in despite a pretax loss primarily because of two significant items which were accounted for as permanent differences between our pretax book loss and our taxable income 
the more significant of these items  the portion of the stock compensation expense we recorded in that related to incentive stock options for which we cannot assume a tax deduction  was new for the other permanent difference was non deductible meals and entertainment expense 
after adding back these two items to our pretax loss  taxable income resulted  against which we recorded an income tax provision of  our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate due primarily to provisions for state taxes as well as non deductible meals and entertainment expense

disposable products revenue was  for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of  during the same period in the revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases  however  average unit prices also increased slightly across virtually all of our disposable product categories  accounting for approximately of the disposables revenue growth  primarily due to a higher mix of clirpath catheters which carry a higher unit selling price than our other products 
we separate our disposable products revenue into two categories atherectomy and lead removal 
for the year ended december   our atherectomy revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
atherectomy revenue grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with atherectomy revenue includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular system

the income tax benefit recognized in included the release of  related to a valuation allowance that we determined is no longer required on specific deferred taxes 
the amount represented the value of net operating losses and future temporary deductible differences between book and taxable income that we determined were more likely than not going to be realized in the form of reduced taxable income in future 
table of contents years 
subsequent to recording the net deferred tax asset in  in we have provided the full amount of income tax expense against current earnings 
our effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate due primarily to provisions for state taxes as well as non deductible meals and entertainment expense 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
this amount does not include approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which are limited under section of the internal revenue code of no deferred tax asset has been provided for million of net operating losses as we have determined that we will not receive any future tax benefit from this million before their expiration

we also have tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which currently have no expiration date  of approximately million euros us million available to offset future taxable income  if any  in the netherlands 
however  in  the netherlands tax authorities proposed that substantially all of the tax loss carryforwards be disallowed 
we are actively defending the availability of these loss carryforwards 
these foreign loss carryforwards have been fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
if the tax loss carryforwards are ultimately disallowed  there will be no negative impact to our historical statement of operations  although it may adversely affect our cash flow and financial position 
an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately  is available to offset future regular tax liabilities and has no expiration date

at december   based upon the level of historical income and projections for future income  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of  as we have determined it is more likely than not a portion of the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and long term investment securities of  an increase of  from  at december  the increase was primarily due to the million of net proceeds from the secondary stock offering we completed in may 
table of contents we consider the total of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities to be available for operating activities since the cash equivalents and investment securities can be readily converted to cash 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december  compared with  at december   an increase of  the increase was due to a decision to keep a small portion of the proceeds from the secondary stock offering in cash equivalent money market accounts in anticipation of our short term working capital needs to support the growth of our business 
our current and long term investment securities portfolio totaled  at december  compared with  at december  long term investment securities have a maturity of more than one year but not more than two years 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities totaled  and consisted primarily of the following an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of  as a result of expanding placement activity of our laser systems through cap free  rental  or evaluation programs 
an increase in trade accounts receivable of  due to increased sales 
a payment of  made in january to edwards lifesciences corporation in settlement of a royalty dispute see item legal proceedings 
increased inventories of  primarily the result of higher stocking levels to meet the increase in laser and catheter demand 
the above uses of cash by operating activities were partially offset by the following sources for the year ended december  net loss of  plus non cash expenses of  which consisted of depreciation and amortization of  stock compensation expense of  and the fair value of options granted for consulting services of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  exclusive of the  reduction in accrued liabilities related to the edwards payment noted above as a result of increased purchasing activity  increased payroll related accruals and increased royalty and related interest accruals 
we continue to stay focused on the management of accounts receivable as measured by days sales outstanding and will continue this focus in with the goal of maintaining the current level of days sales outstanding  although there can be no assurances this goal will be achieved 
for the equipment held for rental or loan account  any increases will be based on the level of evaluation or rental including cap free laser placements offset by sales of laser systems previously placed under evaluation or rental programs 
we continue to expect the majority of our laser placement activity in to be in the form of cap free units 
for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was  most of this amount represented purchases of investment securities of  net of sales of investment securities of  made from the proceeds of the secondary stock offering completed in may the remainder of cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures during which totaled  these expenditures included manufacturing capacity expansion projects  additional capital items for research and development projects and additional enterprise software purchases 
capital expenditures are expected to increase further in due to additional capital items for research and development projects  continued manufacturing expansion projects  software purchases  and capital expenditures related to a new facility for which we signed a year lease in january net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december    of which related to the proceeds of our seconding stock offering completed in may the remaining  of cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees  primarily through the exercise of stock options but also as a result of stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents we believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our currently budgeted operating needs for the coming twelve months 
at december  and  we had placed a number of systems on cap free  rental  and evaluation programs 
a total of  and  was recorded as equipment held for rental or loan at december  and  respectively  and is being depreciated over three to five years  depending on whether the laser system is remanufactured or new 
contractual obligations the company leases office space  furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory 
the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  royalty obligations  reorganization costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the system and  in some cases  completion of physician training 
our team of field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser and  in some cases  participation in the training program at each site 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
revenue from warranty service and service contracts is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the related service contract period  which is generally one year 
revenue from fee for service arrangements is recognized upon completion of the related service 
we offer three laser system placement programs  which are described below  in addition to the sale of laser systems cap free rental program under this program  we retain title to the laser system and the customer agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
customers are expected  but not required  to make minimum purchases of catheters at regular intervals  and we reserve the right to have the unit returned should the minimum purchases not be made 
we recognize the total surcharge as revenue each month  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser unit each month 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue 
table of contents based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
evergreen rental program rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we also offer a straight monthly rental program  and there are a small number of hospitals that pay rent of  to  per month under this program 
evaluation programs the company loans laser systems to institutions for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser  although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we adopted emerging issues task force bulletin eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july  the primary impact of the adoption of eitf was to treat service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting 
as such  the fair value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty period 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally includes delivery and installation of the laser system and  in some cases  completion of physician training 
prior to july   revenue for the sale of laser equipment and the one year warranty was recognized upon shipment of the laser 
deferred revenue associated with service to be performed during the warranty period totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
we have recorded a loss contingency within our accrued royalty liability of approximately  related primarily to patent litigation with dr 
peter rentrop which is discussed in further detail in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements based on amounts awarded to dr 
rentrop by the jury in a recent trial 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
the company has applied the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas r to its valuation methods 

table of contents the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires recognition of expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for year ended december  was  which consisted of compensation expense related to employee stock options based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period  and the estimated value to be realized by employees related to shares expected to be issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model

subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
since our investment securities have maturities that are generally less than one year and not more than two years  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment securities 
as of december   the unrealized loss on our investment securities was  as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and current and long term investment securities of million 
overall average duration to maturity for all cash and marketable securities is less than one year with of the portfolio under one year and the remaining between one and two years 
the weighted average interest rate earned on the portfolio is 
at december   the marketable securities consisted of government or government agency securities and certificates of deposit 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our operating results 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately  of decreased revenue and  of decreased operating expenses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro 
accordingly  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated net income for the year ended december  was a decrease in net income of
