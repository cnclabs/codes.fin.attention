item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market highway and transportation safety products to protect  direct and inform motorists  pedestrians and road workers in both domestic and international markets 
our operations are comprised of three reportable segments within the highway and transportation safety industry  concentrating on safety problems and designing products to provide transportation safety solutions 
our three reportable segments are the manufacture and sale of highway and transportation safety products which protect and direct  the manufacture and sale of products and services which inform  and the manufacture and sale of products which are used for intersection control 
the protect and direct segment provides solutions for improving safety on the roads either by minimizing the severity of crashes that occur or by preventing crashes from occurring by directing or guiding traffic 
the primary product lines within the protect and direct segment include energy absorbing products such as crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels and water filled barriers  and directing and guiding products such as flexible post delineators and glare screen systems 
the inform segment provides solutions for improving traffic flow and safety on roads and runways by providing information 
the primary product lines within the inform segment include advanced sensing products which measure distance  count and classify vehicles  weather sensing systems  computerized highway advisory radio transmitting systems  and other transportation equipment 
the intersection control segment provides solutions for controlling intersections  including intelligent intersection traffic control systems  pedestrian signals  video detection equipment and other transportation equipment 
our products are sold worldwide by a direct sales force and through a distribution network to customers in the highway construction and safety business  state and municipal departments of transportation  and other governmental transportation agencies 
the domestic market for highway and transportation safety products is directly affected by federal  state and local governmental policies and budgets 
a portion of our sales is ultimately financed by funds provided to the states by the federal government 
historically  these funds have covered to of the cost of highway safety projects on roads constructed or maintained with federal assistance 
seasonality affects our business with generally a higher level of sales in our fourth fiscal quarter 
results of operations summary we believe that fiscal was a transitional year for us 
as expected  our results for the year were affected by the restructuring of our intersection control segment which was completed in the second quarter of this year 
overall sales decreased for fiscal primarily due to discontinued product lines related to our restructuring activities in the intersection control segment 
our protect and direct segment and our inform segment achieved strong sales for the year aided by strong international sales which increased to  during the year  we improved our operating efficiency and lowered our overall cost structure which led to an increased gross profit margin for fiscal compared to fiscal the operating margin for our protect and direct segment reached our targeted level of for fiscal the operating margin for our inform segment was at a strong level of 
the intersection control segment recorded an operating loss for the fiscal year  as sales were below break even levels 
however  the operating loss was less than it was in fiscal because we have significantly reduced overhead and fixed costs through the restructuring activities in this segment 
sales growth for fiscal was driven primarily by international sales growth 
domestic sales were not as robust as we expected in fiscal since the passage of the federal funding legislation  safetea lu  in august sales for both the protect and direct and the inform segments were flat domestically compared to fiscal given our history as a late stage benefactor of industry spending  we believe that domestic demand for our products has not yet fully benefited from opportunities developing as a result of the federal funding

revenues our net sales for fiscal decreased to  from  for due to lower sales in the intersection control segment as further described below 
our net sales for fiscal increased to  from  for due to sales increases across all operating segments 
geographic international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the protect and direct segment  where international sales increased  or  to  the increase in international sales in the protect and direct segment was primarily due to increased sales of triton water filled barriers and crash cushions in the asia pacific region 
international sales for the inform segment increased to  primarily due to increased sales of sensing products in canada 
international sales for the intersection control segment decreased to  due to the discontinuation of product lines related to our restructuring activities 
domestic sales for fiscal decreased to  from  primarily due to decreases in the intersection control segment caused by the discontinuation of certain product lines 
international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the intersection control segment  where international sales increased  or  to  the increase in international sales in the intersection control segment was primarily due to increased sales of traffic signals in latin america and also to increased sales in europe and canada 
international sales for the inform segment increased to  international sales for the protect and direct segment increased only slightly after the increase achieved in fiscal domestic sales for fiscal increased to  from  due to sales increases in all operating segments  particularly in the protect and direct segment 
protect and direct net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due principally to strong sales internationally as those markets are increasingly recognizing the importance of our safety devices 
domestically sales were flat with increased sales of truck mounted attenuators tma s offset somewhat by decreased sales of permanent crash cushions 
the sales increases of certain product lines were attributable to increased spending on workzone and other highway safety projects since the enactment of the federal highway bill 
in addition  we saw increased spending on new products such as the sst safestop trailer tma 
net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due to increases across most major product lines and particularly truck mounted attenuators tma s  delineators and permanent crash cushions  which were offset somewhat by lower sales of parts 
the sales increases were attributable to increased spending on workzone and other highway safety projects since the enactment of the federal highway bill and to increased spending on new products such as the sst safestop trailer tma and the quest crash cushion 
inform net sales for the inform segment for fiscal increased slightly to  from  for fiscal excluding  in sales related to the sale of the weather forecasting product line which was sold at the end of fiscal  sales for the inform segment increased due to record sales of highway advisory radio products and increased sales of traffic sensing products 
net sales for the inform segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due to increased sales of highway advisory radio products which achieved record sales for the year 
in addition  sales of weather sensing systems increased during fiscal we believe products within the inform segment also benefited from the passage of the federal highway bill in as spending on these products is more discretionary 
intersection control net sales for our intersection control segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal due to the discontinuation of product lines as part of our restructuring activities for this segment as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales for the company s intersection control segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due in part to strong international sales growth 
however  this sales growth was less than expected and resulted in the approval of a restructuring plan in april for this segment 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the gross margin in the protect and direct segment improved due to volume related efficiencies offset somewhat by increased raw material costs  higher freight costs and unfavorable product sales mix 
the gross margin for the inform segment decreased due to unfavorable product sales mix 
the gross margin in the intersection control segment decreased due to inventory write offs of  recorded in the first quarter as part of the restructuring plan 
excluding the  in inventory write offs  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
our gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the gross margin in the protect and direct segment decreased due to increased raw material costs  higher freight costs and unfavorable product sales mix 
the gross margin for the inform segment increased due to volume efficiencies related to the higher level of sales 
the gross margin in the intersection control segment decreased due to unfavorable product sales mix and plant inefficiencies associated with the restructuring activities 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal selling and administrative expenses in the protect and direct segment increased due to variable expenses related to the increased level of sales and to expenses incurred in establishing our new facility in beijing  china 
selling and administrative costs for the inform segment decreased primarily due to lower personnel related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses in the intersection control segment decreased primarily as a result of our restructuring efforts 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal include  in expense related to the adoption in fiscal of fas r requiring the expensing of stock options as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for primarily due to the lower level of sales for fiscal selling and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal selling and administrative expenses in the protect and direct segment decreased due to the elimination of costs incurred by our former captive manufacturer which was sold last year  and due to lower marketing expenses 
selling and administrative expenses in the intersection control segment decreased primarily due to the realization of cost reduction efforts over the past year 
selling and administrative costs for the inform segment increased partially due to variable expenses related to the increased level of their sales 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal include  in stock option expense related to the adoption in fiscal of fas r  for which no related expense was recorded in fiscal selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for primarily due to the increase in sales and the realization of cost reduction efforts 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal expenditures for the intersection control segment decreased related to the restructuring of the intersection control segment 
expenditures for fiscal for both the protect and direct and inform segments were consistent with fiscal research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal expenditures increased across all operating segments as work continued on the development of innovative new products to address safety needs both here and abroad 
gain on sale of assets as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of  in fiscal this gain included a gain of  on the sale of a former manufacturing facility of the protect and direct segment  a gain of  resulting from final contingent proceeds relating to the sale of the weather forecasting product line in the inform segment and a gain of  on the sale of the assets of the automated traffic enforcement product line in the intersection control segment 
we recorded a gain of  in fiscal in the inform segment related to the sale of the assets of the weather forecasting product line 
during fiscal  we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of  related to the sale of certain machinery  equipment and land in the protect and direct segment 
gain on legal settlements as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a gain of  in fiscal in the intersection control segment due to the settlement of legal claims with the sellers of us traffic corporation and peek traffic corporation 
restructuring costs as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded  in restructuring costs in the intersection control segment in the first and second quarters of fiscal included in the restructuring costs are  in employee severance and benefits   in lease obligations   in net asset sales and asset and inventory write offs and  in facility exit costs  consultants and legal costs 
we recorded  in restructuring costs in the intersection control segment in fiscal included in the restructuring costs are  in employee severance and benefits   in lease obligations   in net asset sales and write offs and  in facility exit costs  consultants and legal costs 
asset impairment charges in fiscal year  results at our intersection control segment continued to be substandard and we adopted a restructuring plan in april as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the restructuring plan  we sold the portable variable message sign  illuminated street lighting and tunnel lighting product lines and we discontinued other low margin and non core product lines 
as a result of the continued poor performance and the company s impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying amounts of certain long lived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimated future operating cash flows to be generated by those assets  which were lower than previously projected 
as further discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges in the intersection control segment of  or  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share 
the charges included  for goodwill and  for fixed assets 
operating profit loss the operating loss decreased to  for fiscal from an operating loss of  for fiscal the decreased operating loss was primarily due to large asset impairment charges incurred in fiscal  as well as an improved gross profit margin and lower selling and administrative costs in fiscal as discussed above 
the fiscal operating loss included gains on sales of assets of  restructuring costs of  and related inventory write offs of  the fiscal operating loss included asset impairment charges of  restructuring costs of  gains on legal settlements of  and a gain on the sale of assets of  without these items  operating profit would have increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal operating profit for the protect and direct segment increased  to  for fiscal  which included a gain on sale of assets of  from  for fiscal primarily due to improved gross margins as discussed above 
operating profit for the inform segment increased  to  for fiscal  including a  gain on sale of assets  from  for fiscal  which included an  gain on sale of assets  primarily due to the reduction in selling and administrative costs as discussed above 
the operating loss for the intersection control segment was  including restructuring costs of  related inventory write offs recorded in cost of sales of  and a gain on sale of assets of  compared to an operating loss for fiscal of  which included  in asset impairment charges   in restructuring charges and  in gains on legal settlements 
the operating loss of  for fiscal compared to operating profit of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal  which were only partially offset by an improved gross profit margin and lower selling and administrative costs as discussed above and the gains on legal settlements and sale of assets 
the fiscal operating loss included asset impairment charges of  restructuring costs of  gains on legal settlements of  and a gain on the sale of assets of  without these items  operating profit would have increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal operating profit for the protect and direct segment increased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal which included  in gain on sale of assets  primarily due to lower selling and administrative costs as discussed above 
operating profit for the inform segment increased  to  for fiscal  including an  gain on the sale of assets  from  for fiscal primarily due to the higher sales and volume efficiencies related to the higher level of sales 
the operating loss for the intersection control segment was  including asset impairment charges of  restructuring costs of  and a gain on legal settlements of  compared to an operating loss for fiscal of interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased slightly to  from  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to our lower level of average long term debt outstanding during fiscal and partially due to lower interest rates on our revolving bank debt 
the interest rate on our bank credit facility is based on prime or libor  plus a margin 
our overall weighted average interest rate was as of june  compared to our weighted average rate of as of june  the interest rate on the company s convertible debt issued during fiscal is 
the company expects the average interest rate during fiscal on all debt to be approximately 
interest expense for fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates and also to the higher level of average long term debt outstanding during fiscal income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate 
we expect to provide for income taxes at a rate of for fiscal however  this rate may be negatively impacted based on management s ongoing evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets recorded are realizable 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate 
included in the income tax benefit for fiscal was  relating to the asset impairment charges 
net earnings loss the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal were gains on sales of assets  restructuring costs and related inventory write offs totaling  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
included in the net loss for fiscal were asset impairment charges  restructuring costs  a gain on sale of assets and legal settlement gains totaling  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
without these items  net earnings would have increased to  or per diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal were asset impairment charges  restructuring costs  a gain on sale of assets and legal settlement gains totaling  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
included in the net loss for fiscal was a gain on sale of assets of  or per diluted share 
without these items  the net loss would have been  or per diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks and other sources 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june  and access to additional funds of approximately million under our secured bank credit agreement 
we believe that this bank credit facility is an important source of liquidity 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility with a million sub facility for letters of credit 
we must maintain a minimum availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
total availability is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  machinery and equipment and real estate 
we are also required to maintain a maximum senior leverage ratio 
our covenants limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
we are in compliance with these covenants and expect to remain in compliance through fiscal under certain conditions  we may request a release of all security interests at which time we would no longer be subject to a borrowing base formula  but would be subject to several additional financial covenants 
the agreement currently expires in february  but may be renewed one additional year on each anniversary date upon mutual consent of the company and the bank 
our outstanding borrowings were  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding on our bank credit facility 
this compares to  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding on our bank credit facility 
included in long term debt as of june  and june  was million in convertible senior subordinated notes due february and a million five year subordinated promissory note due april  the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding was  as of june  and  as of june  during february  we sold  of convertible senior subordinated notes due february  in a private placement and received net proceeds of  the net proceeds were used to pay off our bank term loan and reduce the amount of its revolving credit agreement 
the conversion price is per share  which represented a premium over the closing price of our stock on the close of the transaction 
if fully converted  the notes would convert into approximately  shares of our common stock 
the shares are not included in earnings per share as they are currently anti dilutive until earnings per share reach approximately per share 
the notes are fully redeemable by the company at any time after february  at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the investors may require us to repurchase the notes in cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on february   or cash flows cash flows provided by operations were  during fiscal this compares with  in fiscal and  in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash flow from operations was primarily derived from earnings before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and asset impairment charges 
the decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal is primarily due cash restructuring charges 
investing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal expenditures during fiscal were  for capital and patent expenditures  which were offset somewhat by proceeds received from the sale of assets 
financing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to cash used of  during fiscal and cash used of  in fiscal during fiscal  we borrowed a net  on our outstanding revolving credit facility and paid  on other notes payable 
we received cash of  from the exercise of common stock options 
the payment of our semi annual cash dividend used cash of  for  we anticipate needing approximately  in cash for capital expenditures 
we also expect to invest approximately  in our beijing  china facility in fiscal we will also need  to pay the subordinated promissory note on its due date in april  we may require additional investments in working capital to maintain growth 
we may also need additional funds to repurchase our common stock from time to time or if we acquire product lines or businesses that complement our existing operations 
these expenditures will be financed either through our cash on hand  cash generated from its operations or from borrowings available under our bank credit facility 
we currently expect cash generated from operations to be higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal however  there can be no assurance that this will occur  or to what extent this will occur 
we believe that our existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under our existing credit facility are sufficient for all planned operating and capital requirements in the near term 
if needed and available on favorable terms  we may also enter into other debt or equity financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are subject to certain debt obligations  guarantees  commitments and contingent liabilities further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents our contractual obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as of june  less than more than total year years years years dollar amounts in thousands long term debt estimated interest payments operating leases  net minimum royalty payments retirement award program purchase obligations total amount includes expected cash payments on long term debt based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals 
amount includes estimated interest payments based on interest rates as of the current period 
interest rates on variable rate debt are subject to change in the future 
interest is estimated based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals of long term debt currently outstanding 
retirement award is a fixed number of quixote corporation shares for each of the participants each year for which the income tax obligation is paid in cash 
purchase obligations include non cancellable orders with suppliers in the normal course of business on a short term basis 
as disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into bid and performance related bonds associated with various contracts 
potential payments due under these bonds are related to our performance under the applicable contract 
the total amount of bid and performance related bonds that were available and undrawn as of june  was  we also have standby letters of credit covering potential workers compensation liabilities and other liabilities 
the total standby exposure relating to letters of credit as of june  was  future outlook we believe that the enactment of the federal transportation funding legislation  safetea lu  in august will improve prospects for increased domestic spending for our products in fiscal currently  we believe that domestic demand for our products has not yet fully benefited from opportunities developing as a result of safetea lu and an improving industry environment 
given our history as a late stage benefactor of industry spending  we remain optimistic that we have properly positioned our business for growth once spending increases the demand for our products 
we also expect international sales to continue to be an important driver of our sales growth and may reach between and million for fiscal however  it is difficult to predict to what extent we will see increased spending for our products and there can be no assurance that either domestic or international sales will increase 
to meet increasing international sales demands and further penetrate emerging markets  we are investing in international growth opportunities 
this includes the formation of a new company in beijing  china during our investment in this new company is currently expected to be approximately million in fiscal we expect our beijing facility to be profitable in fiscal and to be able to fund its own operations  however there is no guarantee 
the development of sales may be slower than expected which would require us to fund their operations for an indefinite period 
we believe fiscal was a transitional year for us 
we expect to see growth in sales and profitability for each of our segments 
we expect that sales for both the protect and direct and the inform segments may reach record levels again in fiscal we are beginning to see bids for large contracts for the intersection control segment after a decline in bid activity over the past couple years 
in january  we were awarded a million contract from the new york city department of transportation for traffic controllers to be delivered over three years 
we expect to begin recording revenue relating to this contract in the second half of fiscal we believe that this award and the completion of the restructuring plan are important steps in reaching profitability for the intersection control segment in fiscal however  there is no guarantee that the segment will reach a sufficient level of sales to be profitable 
we historically experience fluctuation in our gross profit margin from quarter to quarter primarily due to sales volume related to seasonality  variability in product mix and changes in our competitive environment 
the gross profit margins of certain acquired product lines  primarily the traffic and intersection control product lines  are lower than our historical gross profit margin  which is currently adversely affecting our gross profit margin 
we are experiencing rigorous price competition in our intersection control segment  and in the weather sensing system product line 
we do not believe these trends will improve in the near future 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management s estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  certain normal and recurring estimates are made including estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation reserves  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  health care liabilities and determining stock based compensation expense 
these estimates are made using management s best judgment given relevant factors and available data 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to our june  consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies  methods and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes in accounting policies  methods and estimates used by management except for the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment on july  in the opinion of management  we do not have any individual accounting policy or use any individual estimate that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
we believe the following significant accounting policies and methods used by the company are the most important to the presentation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized when either services have been rendered or both title and risk of loss of products have been transferred to unaffiliated customers 
additionally  we ensure that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  and the revenue is fixed or determinable 
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts and credits is made based upon management s analysis of bad debts  credits and returns 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
actual costs are used to value raw materials and supplies 
standard costs  which approximate actual costs  are used to value finished goods and work in process 
standard costs include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels  ages and salability 
long lived assets long lived assets include such items as goodwill  patents  product rights  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we assess the possibility of obsolescence  demand  new technology  competition  and other pertinent economic factors and trends that may have an impact on the value or remaining lives of these assets 
amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to future undiscounted cash flows of underlying asset groups 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
fair values of amortized long lived assets are determined based upon the performance of a fair value appraisal 
patents and other finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or systematic method over the life of the patent or intangible asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value in a one step analysis 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step analysis 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit s fair value to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
fair values are determined using present value methodologies 
as discussed further in note to our june  consolidated financial statements  as a result of our annual impairment review during fiscal  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  relating to goodwill and amortized long lived assets of the intersection control segment 
our annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charges for fiscal years or the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow methods and are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
restructuring charges we account for restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
generally  costs associated with the exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred 
costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent that any future tax benefits are not expected to be fully realized  such future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income so that the assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
we expect the deferred tax assets currently recorded to be fully realizable  however there can be no assurance that an increased valuation allowance would not need to be recorded in the future 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment as of july  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  share based compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year ended june  includes compensation cost for all share based awards which were unvested as of july  as well as compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the fair value of the options granted is being amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our stock option plans are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material affect on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we will adopt fin effective july  and we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position  consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
material differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings 
forward looking statements various statements made within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the sec s safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of and rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
except for historical information  any statement that addresses expectations or projections about the future  including statements about our strategy for growth  product development  market position  expenditures  financial results or changes in governmental legislation  policies and conditions  is a forward looking statement 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements and that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those detailed in our public filings with the sec  news releases and other communications  which speak only as of the dates of those filings or communications 
we do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
factors which could cause materially different results include  among others  uncertainties related to continued federal  state and municipal funding for highways and risks related to reductions in government expenditures  the successful completion  integration and rationalization of acquisitions  the ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to be in compliance with financing agreements  the introduction and acceptance of our products and services  an unfavorable change in product sales mix  seasonality along with the extent and timing of the award of large contracts  the cyclical nature of our governmental markets  competitive and pricing pressures  increasing raw material costs  excess manufacturing capacity  weather conditions and natural disasters  acts of war and terrorist activities  the possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and general economic conditions 
non gaap financial information we believe that the sale of assets  gain on legal settlements  restructuring costs and asset impairment charge affect the comparability of the results of operations and net loss of the fiscal year to the results of operations for the and fiscal years 
we also believe that disclosing operating income and net loss excluding those items will allow investors to more easily compare fiscal year results to fiscal years and results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
the exposure to interest rate fluctuations was significantly reduced in the third quarter of fiscal when we issued convertible debt and used the proceeds to pay down the debt issued pursuant to the revolving credit agreement
