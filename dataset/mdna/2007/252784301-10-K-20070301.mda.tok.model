item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained in our sec filings 
overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that owns  as of february   twenty one hotels and resorts that contain nearly  guest rooms 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and resort focused real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality and resort focused real estate we own and seek to acquire premium hotels and resorts in north america 
since our formation in may  we have acquired properties  with purchase prices aggregating over billion  including five hotels with purchase prices aggregating over million in these hotels and resorts are all categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resorts such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that these gateway cities and destination resorts are high growth markets because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry and expensive construction costs 
we believe that the higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
conservative capital structure we are committed to maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure with prudent leverage levels 
during through  we have taken advantage of the low interest environment by fixing our debt rates for an extended period of time 
depending on the outlook for interest rates in the future we maintain the flexibility to modify these strategies 
as of december   of our debt carried fixed interest rates  with a weighted average interest rate of  and a weighted average maturity date of years 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  representing a net debt to enterprise value ratio of  which is calculated as our market capitalization plus net debt 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has established a broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with the managers of our hotels in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
during we completed a significant amount of capital reinvestment in our hotels completing projects that ranged from a room renovation courtyard manhattan midtown east  los angeles airport marriott  bethesda marriott suites to a total renovation and repositioning of the hotel torrance marriott and the oak brook hills marriott resort 
in connection with our planned renovations and repositionings  our senior management team and our asset managers are individually committed to completing these renovations on time  on budget and with minimum disruption at our hotels 
we are optimistic that  when completed  these renovations will enable us to achieve higher rates and greater demand for our hotels 
a core of our asset management strategy is to leverage national hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful national brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
dominant national hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  as a result  all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top three national brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but two of the hotels are operated by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in acquiring only those hotels that are operated under a nationally recognized brand or can be converted into a branded hotel 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  adr  revpar  ebitda  and ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately of our total revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of marriott and its brands 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business

contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel sales 
in addition  we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management agreement 
as of december   we had set aside million for capital projects in property improvement funds million and lender held restricted cash million 
funds held in property improvement funds for one hotel are typically not permitted to be applied to any other property

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
non gaap financial measures we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended december  year ended december  period from may  to december  in thousands net income loss interest expense income tax expense benefit real estate related depreciation and amortization ebitda we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in determining our results after taking into account the impact of our capital structure 
year ended december  year ended december  period from may  to december  in thousands net income loss real estate related depreciation and amortization ffo critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
investments in hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at fair value 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
the company records the cost of awards with service conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
no awards with performance based or market based conditions have been issued 
accounting for key money 
marriott has contributed to us certain amounts  which we refer to as key money  in exchange for the right to manage certain of our hotels 
we defer key money received from a hotel manager in conjunction with entering into a long term hotel management agreement and amortize the amount received against management fees over the term of the management agreement 
accounting for yield support 
marriott has provided us with operating cash flow guarantees for certain hotels will fund shortfalls of actual hotel operating income  which is net of management fees  compared to a negotiated target net operating income 
we refer to these guarantees as yield support 
yield support received is recognized over the period earned if the yield support is not refundable and there is reasonable uncertainty of receipt at inception of the management agreement 
yield support is recorded as an offset to base management fees 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth quarters 
new accounting pronouncements fasb interpretation no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and  which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
the face amount of our outstanding debt at december  was approximately million  none of which was variable rate debt 
if market rates of interest were to increase by  or approximately basis points  the decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest were to decrease by one percentage point  or approximately basis points  the increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million 
as of december   the fair value of the million of fixed rate debt was approximately million
