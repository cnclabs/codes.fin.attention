we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this annual report on form k to conform our prior statements to actual results 
the periods presented herein consist of our fiscal years ended  and our fiscal years ended and consisted of weeks  compared to our fiscal year ended  which consisted of weeks 
the results for our fiscal year ended september  are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarterly or annual financial period  including the fiscal year ending september  overview dolby laboratories develops and delivers innovative products and technologies that improve the entertainment experience 
since ray dolby founded dolby laboratories in  we have been at the forefront of delivering sound technologies that are employed throughout the entertainment creation  distribution and playback process to enhance the entertainment experience 
today  dolby technologies are standard in a wide range of entertainment platforms 
our technologies are used in virtually all dvd players and personal computer dvd playback software  increasingly in digital televisions and portable electronic devices  and also in a wide array of consumer electronic products such as gaming systems and audio video receivers 
dolby cinema products are used in movie theatres around the world 
dolby broadcast products distribute high quality audio around the world 
our objective is to be an essential element in the best entertainment technologies by delivering innovative and enduring technologies that enrich the entertainment experience 
we believe that our well recognized brand and established history of successful innovation put us in a position to expand the use of our technologies in existing and new markets and to capitalize on key trends in digital entertainment  such as the transition to high definition television  digital cinema  space efficient home theatre systems  portable media and an increasing number of media delivery channels 
we deliver technologies  products and services at each critical stage of the entertainment chain content creation  content distribution and content playback 
we work closely with content creators  including filmmakers  television producers  music producers  and video game designers to incorporate dolby technologies in entertainment content 
as a result  we are better positioned to partner with entertainment distributors to deliver that content with our technologies  whether through millimeter film or digital content for theatres  dvds  broadcasts or the internet 
by working successfully to encode and distribute content with dolby technologies  we are able to license our decoding technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers and independent software vendors for consumer playback and sell our cinema equipment for large scale public playback in movie theatres 
our involvement across the entertainment chain has resulted in a widely recognized brand and enables us to introduce technologies and services into new areas 
historically  we have conducted our business in two operating segments licensing our technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronics products and independent software vendors  and selling our professional products and related services 
in an effort to improve our ability to scale our organization and effectively apply our strategy across our markets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reorganized our business from two operating segments into a functional organizational model 
as a result of this change  we now operate as a single reportable segment on an enterprise wide basis 
we generate revenue by licensing our technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronics products and independent software vendors  and selling our professional products and related services to entertainment content creators  producers  and distributors 
we are a global organization 
we have licensed our technologies to manufacturers in approximately countries and our licensees distribute products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
we sell our products and services in over countries 
in fiscal  and  revenue from outside the united states was  and of our total revenue  respectively 

table of contents opportunities  challenges and risks licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we categorize our licensing revenue into the following markets consumer electronics ce market primarily comprised of dvd players  dvd recorders  audio video receivers and home theatres in a box 
personal computer pc market primarily comprised of software dvd players and dvd authoring applications 
broadcast market primarily comprised of televisions and television set top boxes 
gaming market primarily comprised of video game consoles 
automotive market comprised of in car entertainment products 
licensing services revenue from the administration of joint licensing programs 
historically  the consumer electronics market  which is driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd players  has been our largest market  generating just over of our licensing revenue in fiscal  approximately in fiscal  and just under in fiscal the decrease in the consumer electronics market as a percentage of total licensing revenue has been due to faster revenue growth in our other markets  primarily the pc and broadcast markets 
we expect next generation dvd players for high definition content to be a growth opportunity in the consumer electronics market 
our dolby digital  dolby digital plus and dolby truehd technologies have been selected as mandatory audio standards in the high definition digital versatile disc hd dvd format 
dolby digital has been selected as a mandatory audio standard and dolby digital plus and dolby truehd have been selected as optional audio standards in the blu ray disc format 
the release and consumer adoption of next generation dvd players has been slower than expected due  in part  to the competing hd dvd and blu ray disc formats 
consequently  our ability to generate significant royalties from the incorporation of our technology in next generation dvd players has been delayed 
even assuming resolution of the competing disc format conflict  the rate of consumer adoption of next generation dvd players is uncertain and may be slower than past growth rates of traditional dvd players 
we are continuing to diversify our sources of licensing revenue by actively promoting the incorporation of our technologies for use in growing markets outside of our consumer electronics market  such as personal computers  broadcast  gaming and automotive 
as a result  revenue from our consumer electronics market has decreased as a percentage of our licensing revenue in fiscal compared to the personal computing market  which represented over of our licensing revenue in fiscal  just over in fiscal  and approximately in fiscal has been primarily driven by sales of software dvd players and to a lesser extent  dvd authoring applications 
historically  pc manufacturers have frequently included dvd playback functionality as part of the software applications included in their products 
in fiscal  microsoft introduced its windows vista operating system 
two of the six editions of this operating system  the windows vista home premium edition and the windows vista ultimate edition  include dolby technologies which help enable dvd playback functionality and dvd authoring capabilities 
since shipments began in february  sales of personal computers for the consumer market offered with the home premium edition have been strong 
in addition  many major pc manufacturers continue to include additional branded software applications with dvd playback capabilities and other features which were not provided in the microsoft operating systems 
this contributed to an increase in licensing revenue from our pc market in fiscal in the future  pc manufacturers may elect to exclude additional dvd software applications on personal computers that include the windows vista home premium edition or windows vista ultimate edition 
additionally  it is unclear at what pace business customers will migrate from their current operating systems to the windows vista operating systems and how such adoption will impact sales of software dvd players for business pcs 

table of contents the broadcast market  which is primarily driven by demand for dolby digital in televisions and set top boxes  represented approximately of our licensing revenue in fiscal  just over in fiscal and just over in fiscal the broadcast market has benefited from the transition from analog televisions to digital televisions  including high definition televisions hdtv 
we expect this trend to continue  and as a result  we expect revenue from our broadcast market to increase as a percentage of licensing revenue in fiscal we have also introduced new technologies for the broadcast market  including dolby volume  and dynamic range image technologies  dolby contrast and dolby vision 
our dolby volume technology controls the loudness of audio broadcasts to provide a constant volume level 
dolby contrast provides enhanced contrast  while dolby vision combines enhanced contrast with extended brightness and dynamic range for lcd televisions with led backlighting technology 
we do not anticipate generating significant revenue from these technologies in fiscal revenue generated from the gaming and automotive markets has primarily been driven by demand for dolby digital and atrac technology in video game consoles and dolby digital in in car entertainment systems 
revenue generated by our licensing services market has primarily been driven by demand for mpeg and mpeg technologies used in portable music devices 
any future growth in the pc  broadcast  gaming and automotive markets may not fully offset a potential decline in the growth of revenue generated from our consumer electronics market 
our technologies are incorporated in consumer electronics and digital entertainment products throughout the world 
we expect that sales of products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies  such as china and india  will increase in the future as consumers in these geographical markets have more disposable income available to purchase entertainment products  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we also expect that manufacturers from lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production of consumer electronics and digital entertainment products in the future to satisfy this increased demand 
associated with opportunities of doing business in these emerging economies  such as china  are unique risks that have and will continue to affect our operating results  such as manufacturers failing to report or underreporting product shipments 
in an effort to better serve our licensees and address these risks we have expanded our presence in asia  with additional offices in taiwan  shenzhen and seoul and a product testing center in the shanghai waigaoqiao free trade zone 
product sales consists of revenue from the sale of equipment to cinema operators  broadcasters and concert venues  representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our cinema products  which represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal  and of product sales in fiscal  are primarily used to read and decode film soundtracks  calibrate cinema sound systems and to adapt analog cinema audio systems into digital audio formats 
in addition  our digital cinema products load  store  decrypt and decode encrypted digital film files for presentation on a digital projector  as well as provide d capabilities 
sales of our cinema products and services tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the motion picture industry 
a significant trend in the cinema industry is the adoption of digital cinema 
digital cinema offers the motion picture industry possible means to achieve substantial cost savings in printing and distributing movies  to combat piracy  and to enable movies to be played repeatedly without degradation in image and audio quality 
in fiscal we introduced our dolby digital cinema system  which allows for the storage and playback of digital content and in fiscal we introduced dolby d digital cinema technology  which delivers a d experience when combined with an exhibitor s existing digital cinema system 
although the cinema industry is still in the early stages of adoption of digital cinema  the number of exhibitors adopting digital cinema for new theatre construction or existing theatre upgrades continues to grow 
we expect that exhibitors constructing new theatres or upgrading existing theatres will generally choose digital cinema over traditional film cinema 
we have made significant investments in our digital cinema initiative  and if our digital cinema systems are not widely deployed  our future prospects in digital cinema will be limited and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
a number of competitors 
table of contents offer competing products for digital cinema  some of which are priced lower than our products 
at least one competitor has a significantly greater installed base of its competing digital cinema products than we do  which could limit our eventual share of the digital cinema product market 
as the market for digital cinema has grown we have faced more competitive pricing pressures than we have traditionally experienced for cinema products 
as a result  we have had to implement pricing strategies which will have an adverse impact on our product sales gross margins in the future 
in addition  digital cinema is based on open standards  which unlike traditional cinema  does not include our proprietary audio formats 
consequently  as the film industry continues to adopt digital cinema  if we do not adapt our traditional cinema products and services to meet the demands of the digital cinema market  the demand for them will decline 
our broadcast products  which represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal  and of product sales in fiscal  are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
in recent years  growth in consumer demand for high quality television content has increased the demand from broadcasters to deliver more content in dolby digital surround sound  which has positively affected sales of our professional broadcast products 
our live sound products are used to control loudspeaker systems and improve sound quality in concert venues 
our services revenue  which represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  is primarily tied to the motion picture production industry and  in particular  to the number of films being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
the number of films that are produced can be affected by a number of factors  including strikes and work stoppages within the motion picture industry as well as by the tax incentive arrangements that many foreign governments provide filmmakers to promote local filmmaking 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions to license technologies  trademarks and know how  and to sell products and services using the criteria set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin  revenue 
table of contents recognition sab 
for revenue transactions that involve software or software related products  such as fees we earn from integrated software vendors isvs  certain product sales with software elements and certain other transactions  we recognize revenue under the guidance established by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
both sab and sop state that revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution  or an alternative credit evaluation 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether the software element included with a hardware product is more than incidental to the hardware  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
for some of our arrangements  customers receive certain elements of the arrangement over a period of time or after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive product upgrades 
the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated period for which these elements will be delivered  which is sometimes the estimated life of the product 
if we do not have vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement containing software  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and or services have been performed  or until we have vsoe of fair value of all remaining undelivered elements 
when the undelivered element is support  if we do not have fair value for the support element  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
as required by sfas  we perform an impairment test on recorded goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of each unit  including goodwill 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined by using a discounted cash flow model which considers a number of factors  including estimated future cash flows  risks facing us and our current market capitalization 
if the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units  including goodwill  were to exceed our estimation of the fair value of the reporting units  we would record an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we use judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units  which include making assumptions of our future cash flows for each reporting unit 
our fiscal impairment test of goodwill  which was performed in the third quarter of fiscal  resulted in no impairment charge 
fluctuations in our fair value  which may result from changes in economic conditions  our results of operations and other factors  relative to the carrying value  could result in impairment charges in future periods 
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reorganized our business into a functional organizational model 
this reorganization did not impact our goodwill impairment evaluation for fiscal accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including differences in the timing of recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 

table of contents personal holding company tax matters 
for united states federal income tax purposes  a corporation is generally considered to be a personal holding company under the united states internal revenue code if i at any time during the last half of its taxable year more than of its stock by value is owned  directly or indirectly  by virtue of the application of certain stock ownership attribution rules set forth in the internal revenue code for purposes of applying the personal holding company rules  by five or fewer individuals and ii at least of its adjusted ordinary gross income  as defined for united states federal income tax purposes  is personal holding company income 
personal holding company income is generally passive income  including royalty income  subject to certain exceptions such as qualifying software royalties 
a personal holding company is subject to an additional tax on its undistributed after tax income  calculated at the statutory tax rate  which is currently 
since the personal holding company tax is imposed only on undistributed income  a personal holding company can avoid or mitigate liability for the tax  but not interest or penalties  by paying a dividend to its stockholders 
during fiscal  more than of the value of our stock was held by ray dolby and stockholders considered affiliated with him pursuant to the stock ownership attribution rules applicable to personal holding companies 
we expect this will continue to be the case in the foreseeable future 
in addition  a significant portion of our income is from licensing fees  which may constitute personal holding company income 
we are reviewing the characterization of our licensing fees to determine if we may meet the exception to the personal holding company test due to royalties from computer software 
currently  however  we believe less than of dolby laboratories adjusted ordinary gross income is personal holding company income 
given our current sources of revenue  we believe that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is currently liable for personal holding company tax 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period 
we utilize a black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model requires that we make certain assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award and the risk free interest rate over the expected term 
we develop our assumptions for the black scholes pricing model in accordance with guidelines set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulleting no 
 share based payment sab 
we estimate the expected term of stock based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees and applying an assumption of future exercise patterns 
we utilize the historical volatility of our common stock as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience as well as future expectations 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  revenue fiscal year ended change september  september  in thousands licensing percentage of total revenue product sales percentage of total revenue services percentage of total revenue total revenue licensing 
the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased revenue from our personal computer market and broadcast market  and to a lesser extent  from our consumer electronics and gaming markets 
the increase in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by continued growth in shipments of notebook computers  the release of microsoft vista home premium and ultimate editions  which contain dolby technologies  as well as the continued inclusion of additional software dvd player applications by pc manufacturers 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market has been driven by growth in sales of digital televisions and cable and satellite set top boxes that incorporate our technologies 
our consumer electronics market benefited from continued diversification of consumer electronics products containing our technologies  including home theatre in a box systems  audio video receivers  camcorders and portable dvd and music devices 
product sales 
the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales of our broadcast and live sound products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our cinema products 
sales of our broadcast products continued to benefit from broadcasters world wide expanding their capabilities for delivering content in dolby digital surround sound 
in the cinema market  fiscal product sales benefited from new theatre construction  which appears to have slowed in fiscal in fiscal  a significant portion of our sales efforts was focused on our digital cinema initiative 
due to certain contractual and implied obligations requiring us to deliver software upgrades that we have not yet delivered  we are unable to recognize sales of our digital cinema systems 
as of september   we had approximately million of deferred revenue associated with these sales 
we plan to make the software upgrades available to our customers in the second half of fiscal  at which time we expect to recognize revenue along with the associated costs 
services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly services on original films  including digital films  as well as commercials and trailers  and revenue from virtual print fees related to digital cinema

table of contents licensing gross margin 
we license to our customers intellectual property that may be internally developed  acquired by us or licensed from other parties 
our cost of licensing consists principally of royalty obligations to third parties for the licensing of intellectual property rights that we sublicense as part of our licensing arrangements with our customers 
our cost of licensing also includes amortization expenses associated with purchased intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was appropriate to cease accruing royalty expense related to an ongoing dispute with an unrelated patent licensor 
as a result  our licensing gross margin was higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal than historical periods  which resulted in licensing gross margin of for fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal we expect our licensing gross margin to be approximately as we do not expect to recognize expense related to this dispute in the future 
for further detail  see the discussion regarding accrued liabilities in the notes to our financial statements 
product sales gross margin 
cost of product sales primarily consists of material costs related to the products sold  direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead and  to a lesser extent  amortization of certain intangible assets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a collaboration agreement with walt disney pictures and television under which we deployed digital cinema systems in selected theatres throughout the us we funded the majority of the equipment and installation costs related to this deployment  of which the majority was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal cost of product sales for fiscal includes approximately million in charges recorded in connection with this collaboration agreement 
the increase in product sales gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to these charges 
upon satisfying certain contractual obligations requiring us to deliver software upgrades that we have not yet delivered  we expect to recognize revenue and associated costs in fiscal related to sales of digital cinema systems that are currently deferred 
upon recognition  our product sales gross margins will be adversely impacted because these products were sold at a significantly lower margin than our other products 
we expect the impact of this to cause our product sales gross margins to be between approximately and for fiscal at september  we had approximately million of deferred revenue related to these digital cinema systems  and a corresponding million of associated costs 
services gross margin 
cost of services consists primarily of the payroll and benefits costs of employees performing our professional services  the cost of outside consultants and reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of customers 
cost of services for fiscal includes million in charges related to the digital cinema collaboration with walt disney pictures and television discussed above 
the increase in services gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to these charges 
operating expenses fiscal year ended change september  september  in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of total revenue research and development percentage of total revenue gain on settlements percentage of total revenue total operating expenses 
table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel related expenses  professional service fees and facility costs for our sales  marketing and administrative functions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses and related occupancy and travel expenses 
these increases were primarily driven by increases in headcount  bonus expense due to our financial performance exceeding our targets and annual pay increases for existing employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to increases in professional consulting expenses 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new technologies and products 
the increase in research and development expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses due to increases in headcount  bonus expense and annual pay increases for existing employees 
in addition  there were increases in engineering costs related to a variety of research projects  such as imaging  including d  high dynamic range image technologies  and next generation broadcast platforms 
gain on settlements 
gain on settlements includes payments received related to the resolution of disputes with implementation licensees from which we typically do not earn royalties 
in contrast  amounts attributable to the resolution of royalty disputes from licensees that specifically represent unpaid royalties that are subsequently paid are recorded as licensing revenue in the period payment is received and the dispute is resolved  if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in fiscal we recognized million as gain on settlement in connection with the resolution of disputes with three implementation licensees regarding the violation of the terms of their licensing agreements with us  compared to million in fiscal in connection with the resolution of a dispute with one implementation licensee

the increase in other income  net from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by larger cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
in fiscal we had an average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately million  compared to approximately million in fiscal income taxes fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate 
table of contents our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in certain manufacturing incentive tax deductions and an increase in our federal deduction for state taxes 
in addition  our effective tax rate decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to an increase in disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options  an increase in tax free interest income generated from our investments and an increase in research and development tax credits in fiscal due to a change in the tax law 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we increased our estimates for certain manufacturing incentives related to extraterritorial income exclusions and federal domestic production deductions which decreased our tax rate for fiscal by approximately

personal holding company tax matters if we or any of our subsidiaries were to become liable for personal holding company tax  we expect that it is likely that instead of paying the personal holding company tax  we would elect to pay a dividend to our stockholders in an amount equal to all or a significant part of our undistributed personal holding company income 
we expect that we would pay such a dividend out of our available working capital  which could significantly decrease our cash  unless we sought additional financing for this purpose 
any such financing might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if instead of paying a dividend we elect to pay the tax  this could significantly increase our consolidated tax expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash  highly liquid money market funds and united states government agency securities with original maturities of days or less 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which consisted primarily of united states government agency securities  variable rate discount note  and municipal debt with original maturities greater than days 
many of these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could impact our results 
at september  the average investment maturity of our investment portfolio was less than six months 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on the carrying value of our portfolio 
furthermore  a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on interest income over a one year period 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom 
consequently  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with our foreign business operations 
while nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in united states dollars  nearly all of our costs from our foreign operations are derived from transactions denominated in the functional currency of that foreign location 
as a result  our operating income is subject to exposure from changes in exchange rates 
the average exchange rate in fiscal was approximately united states dollars for one british pound sterling  compared to united states dollars for one british pound sterling in fiscal the average exchange rate in fiscal was approximately united states dollars for one australian dollar  compared to united states dollars for one australian dollar in fiscal we estimate that the decrease in the value of the united states dollar during fiscal  primarily relative to the british pound sterling and the australian dollar  decreased our operating income by approximately million 
in addition  we are in the process of expanding our foreign operations  which could increase our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
