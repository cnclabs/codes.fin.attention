overview we are a pioneer and market leader in internet protocol telephony systems for small to medium sized businesses 
we design  manufacture and market next generation  internet protocol phone systems and contact centers that use both the internet and the public telephone network to take advantage of the convergence of voice and data communications 
unlike traditional proprietary phone systems  our systems are designed with open architecture and are built on an industry standard platform 
this adherence to industry standards allows our products to play an important role in the small to medium sized business market by delivering phone systems that can integrate with other technologies and provide integrated voice and data solutions 
we believe this enables our customers to implement communication systems that have an increased return on investment versus past technology investments 
we generated net revenue of million  for a net loss of  during fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal year we derive our revenue from sales of our telephone systems 
product revenue is comprised of direct sales to end users including dealers and sales to distributors 
revenue from product sales to end users and resellers are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we also provide a reserve for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right  in certain circumstances  to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we provide distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to the manufacturing of our products 
several factors that have affected and will continue to affect our revenue growth are the state of economy  the market acceptance of our products  our ability to add new resellers and our ability to design  develop  and release new products 
we engage third party assemblers  which in fiscal year were all quality services and bestronics in san jose  to insert the hardware components into the printed circuit board 
we selected our manufacturing partners with the goals of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
we continue to focus on i developing enhancements to our current products to provide greater functionality and increased capabilities  based on our market research  customer feedback and our competitors product offerings and ii creating new product offerings to both enhance our position in our target market segment and enter new geographical markets 
additionally  we intend to continue selling our products to small to medium sized businesses  enterprise business  multi site businesses  corporate branch offices and call centers 
also  we plan to continue to recruit additional resellers and distributors that focus on selling phone systems to our target customers 
we believe that the adoption rate for this internet telephony is much faster with small to medium sized businesses because many of them have no significant investment on their books for traditional phone systems 
also we believe that small to medium sized businesses are looking for call center type administration to increase the productivity and efficiency of their contacts with customers

in accordance with sop  revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based upon the relative fair values of the elements 
although we provide pcs  the revenue allocated to this element is recognized together with the initial licensing fee on delivery of the software because the pcs fee is included with the initial licensing fee  the pcs included with the initial license fee is for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant  and unspecified upgrades enhancements offered for minimal or no cost during pcs arrangements historically have been and are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequent

our inventory balance was million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
we perform a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter  with consideration given to future customer demand for our products  obsolescence from rapidly changing technology  product development plans  and other factors 
if future demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our estimates prove to be inaccurate due to unforeseen technological changes  we may be required to record additional inventory provision which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs were recorded 
as of december  we had established a reserve to write off million of excess inventory which management believed would not be sold 
during through  we reversed a portion of the reserve related to inventory which was sold 
the amounts of such reversals were  and  in fiscal years ending and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we did not reverse any portions of this reserve 
warranty cost 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if actual products return rates  repair cost or replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  then our gross margin could be adversely affected 
the liability for product warranties was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
this liability was largely related to adjustments of warranty reserve requirements 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities considering the products subject to warranty protection and adjust the amounts as necessary

we are accounting for this investment using the equity method 
we had revenue from product sales to this company of  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
our accounts receivable from this company decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the total equity in net losses of korea investee was approximately  of which  or  was recognized in fiscal in fiscal year equity in net losses of our korea investee was approximately  of which or  was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest and other income  net net interest and other income increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase in net interest and other income was primarily a result of higher interest rates on investments 
we expect net interest and other income to remain relatively flat as we have limited cash reserves to invest 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
for both fiscal years and  respectively  we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
as of september   million of our total assets are classified as cash and cash equivalents compared with million at september  short term investments were approximately and for fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
the company believes its existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  as well as cash expected to be generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs  capital expenditures  and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next months 
the following table presents selected financial information for each of the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended september  in thousands cash and cash equivalents    short term investments    total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by investing activities  cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents    changes in cash flows in fiscal year  our net cash used in operating activities was  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  during the same period in fiscal this change was primarily attributable to our net loss of  for fiscal  an increase of  in net inventories  an increase of  in accounts receivable and  increase in prepaid and other current assets 
the cash impact of the loss for the year was partially offset by non cash adjustments of  in depreciation and amortization costs  and non cash stock based compensation expense of  the net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year was based on a lower net loss of  an increase of approximately  in accounts receivable  an increase of  in net inventories and an increase in accounts payable of approximately  the non cash adjustments to net income were primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization costs of   of non cash stock based compensation expense and a  net loss of a private korean company 
net accounts receivable increased to million at september  from million at september  we attribute the increase in accounts receivable to an increase in sales of our products during the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in days sales outstanding dso at days as of september  from days at september  as we continue to focus on developing products that allow us to enhance our position in our target market segment and enter new markets  we expect to see continued revenue growth for fiscal year generally  as sales levels rise  we expect inventories  accounts receivable and accounts payable to increase 
however  there will be routine fluctuations in these accounts from period to period that may be significant in amount 
we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal year with a cash conversion cycle of days as compared to days for the fourth quarter of fiscal the cash conversion cycle is the duration between purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash from the sale of our products and services and is a metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets 
the cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of days of sales outstanding dso added to days of supply in inventories dos  reduced by days of payable outstanding dpo 
inventories increased to million at september  from million at september  and our annualized inventory turn rate decreased to times as of september  as compared to times as of september  our annualized inventory turn rate represents the number of times inventory is replenished during the year 
this increase in inventories was primarily attributable to the new product introduction of our max voice over ip voip phone system 
inventory management will continue to be an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
accounts payable decreased to  at september  from  at september  the decrease in accounts payable during this period was the result of routine period to period fluctuations 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  as of september  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the stock option exercises made by our president and chief operating officer  jeremiah fleming as described in the form k filed with the sec on april  the company sold and issued  shares of common stock to mr 
fleming at a fair market value of 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
the maturities of our short term investments are staggered throughout the year to ensure we meet our cash requirements 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our products  our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products  the prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase  as well as other factors 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or if sales from our new products or enhancements are lower than expected  we will be required to make additional reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations 
additional financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we also may require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we cannot raise needed funds in the future if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to further develop or enhance our products  take advantage of opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may or may not be able to obtain 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of investing in our securities 
we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of september  we had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable capital and operating leases of million as of september  lease terms on our existing facility operating leases generally range from three to nine years 
we believe  we have sufficient cash reserves to allow us to continue operations for more than a year 
our cash and short term investments totaled approximately million as of september  in fiscal year  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of its common stock in the open market 
the repurchases will be made from time to time through november  at the company s discretion depending on factors such as our stock price  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchase will be made in the open market and will be funded from available working capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  the value of those investments 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and investments  we have concluded that a change in interest rates does not pose a material market risk to us 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in non us currencies  primarily the chinese yuan renminbi 
in the short term  we do not foresee foreign exchange currency fluctuations to pose a material market risk to us 
in future periods over the long term  we anticipate we will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary
