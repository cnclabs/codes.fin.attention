item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products  and metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and pet care markets  and a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations at compounded annual rates of percent and percent  respectively  over the past ten years  largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
in the absence of further acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our cash flow to repay debt 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we would consider other permitted uses of our cash flow  such as repurchases of shares of our common stock or increased dividends to our stockholders 
acquisitions we acquired the white cap closures operations in europe on june   in turkey on july  and in china and the philippines in december from amcor 
white cap is a leading supplier of an extensive range of vacuum closures to consumer goods packaging companies in the food and beverage industries 
white cap has been recombined with our previously acquired white cap closures operations in the united states to create a global leader in vacuum closures for hot filled and retortable food and beverage products 
at the respective closings  we paid an aggregate of million for white cap  including acquisition fees  net of cash actually acquired of million  financed primarily through euro borrowings under our credit agreement 
as part of the acquisitions of the operations in turkey  china and the philippines  we assumed million of indebtedness of such operations 
in january  we acquired the white cap closures operations in venezuela from amcor 
the acquisition of the remaining white cap closures operations in brazil is subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions as provided in the purchase agreement with amcor 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of cousins currie  a leading manufacturer in canada of larger size custom designed plastic containers 
the purchase price of million was financed primarily with canadian dollar borrowings under our credit agreement 

table of contents sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container  plastic container and closures businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past nineteen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top tm easy open ends 
we anticipate that the market will be flat or will decline slightly in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top tm easy open end  representing an increase in unit sales of this value added feature of percent since we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sixfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
with our acquisition in march of silgan white cap americas llc  our former closures joint venture with amcor in which we held a minority position  we became a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
prior to our acquisition in march  this business was the north american business of the worldwide white cap business 
with our acquisition of white cap  we reunited these businesses and reestablished it as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  with leadership positions in the north american and european markets 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
in  we announced the closing of two metal food container manufacturing facilities and one plastic container manufacturing facility in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations  reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top tm easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past 
table of contents five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers such as our metal food container supply agreements with our three largest customers  nestl primarily through and  del monte through and campbell through 
we estimate that in approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales  a majority of our projected plastic container sales and a majority of our projected closures sales in the united sates will be under multi year arrangements 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in recent years  the steel industry in the united states announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher steel costs 
for our non contract customers  we also increased prices to pass through higher steel costs 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
our closures business is also dependent  in part  upon vegetable and fruit harvests 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
in the absence of further acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our cash flow to repay debt 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we would consider other permitted uses of our cash flow  such as repurchases of shares of our common stock or increased dividends to our stockholders 
during  we borrowed million and cdn million of term loans under our credit agreement to finance our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie  respectively 
in addition  our credit agreement allows for an incremental loan facility of million  which may be borrowed in the form of term loans or  for up to million  in the form of revolving loans 
from through  we utilized available cash flow to pay down million of borrowings under our credit agreement 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness  or percent of our total outstanding indebtedness  which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt was percent of our income from operations 
this was higher than the prior year rate of percent primarily as a result of higher average borrowings due to our additional borrowings to fund acquisitions and a higher average cost of borrowings resulting from rising interest rates

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to the acquisition of the international closures operations and higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by lower volumes in the metal food and plastic container businesses 
income from operations in increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase in income from operations was primarily due to the acquisition of the international closures operations and strong operating performance in the domestic closures operations  partially offset by the impact of rationalization charges of million and lower unit volumes in the metal food and plastic container businesses 
net income in increased million to million 
our results included a tax benefit net of fees of per diluted share attributable to tax initiatives implemented during the year  as well as rationalization charges of per diluted share  net of tax 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of an increase in sales in our closures and metal food container businesses  partially offset by a decrease in sales in our plastic container business 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other inflationary costs  partially offset by lower food can volumes 
these volume declines were primarily due to poor growing conditions in california 

table of contents net sales for the plastic container business in decreased million  or percent  as compared to this decrease was principally a result of lower unit volumes  primarily as a result of the shutdown of our valencia  california manufacturing facility and inventory reductions at certain retailers 
this decrease was partially offset by higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
net sales for the closures business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was attributable to the acquisition of the international closures operations and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased percentage points to percent in as compared to percent in  due primarily to the inclusion of the international closures operations which incur such expenses at a higher percentage of its sales than our other operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses included million and million of tax professional fees for research and development and repatriation tax initiatives in and  respectively 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
we recorded rationalization charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these decreases were principally due to the inclusion of rationalization charges recorded in for the exiting of the st 
paul  minnesota and stockton  california manufacturing facilities  a decline in unit volumes as a result of poor growing conditions in california and inflation in certain other manufacturing costs 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin increased primarily as a result of the benefits of productivity improvements and headcount reductions and the benefit of declining resin costs during the first quarter of due to the timing of raw material cost pass throughs 
these improvements were partially offset by lower unit volumes and the inclusion of rationalization charges recorded in for the shut down of the valencia  california manufacturing facility 
income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were primarily due to the inclusion of seven months of operations of the european portion of the international closures acquisition and continued cost reductions in the domestic closures operations  offset by inflation in certain other manufacturing costs and higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales because the international operations incur such expenses at a higher rate as compared to the domestic operations 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for increased million to million as compared to this increase resulted primarily from higher outstanding borrowings which were used to fund the acquisitions completed in and the effects of higher market interest rates 
in addition  in we incurred a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt primarily as a result of the refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility in june 
table of contents provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the effective tax rate was impacted by the cumulative prior year benefits of tax initiatives related to research and development credits completed during the year  manufacturing credits available as a result of the american jobs creation act and the overall impact of a lower effective tax rate associated with the international operations 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
income from operations in increased by million as compared to and operating margin increased to percent from percent for the same periods 
these increases resulted primarily from productivity improvements and continued benefits from the rationalization and integration of manufacturing facilities 
net income in increased million to million in our results include a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt primarily as the result of the refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility 
we used strong cash flows from operations to pay down million of debt during net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs in all of our businesses  partially offset by lower volumes in food cans and plastic containers 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily the result of higher average selling prices resulting from the pass through of higher raw material and other inflationary costs  partially offset by lower food can volumes 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher average selling prices due to price increases in response to higher resin costs  partially offset by lower unit volumes 
net sales for the closures business increased million  or percent  in as compared to resulting from the pass through of higher raw material costs and improved unit volumes 
gross profit 
the slight increase in gross profit margin of percentage points in as compared to was principally due to the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were percentage points higher in as compared to  primarily as a result of a benefit in of million from a litigation settlement reached with an equipment supplier and additional tax and audit professional fees incurred in that are included in corporate expense 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
we recorded rationalization charges totaling million in and million in income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were principally due to the combination of productivity benefits from higher capital spending over the last several years as well as price increases in response to inflationary pressures 
these positive factors were partially offset by increases in other manufacturing costs  particularly energy costs  and lower unit volumes in the food can business 

table of contents income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the decreases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily as a result of lower unit volumes  increased energy costs and higher employee benefit costs  as well as the million benefit in from a litigation settlement 
income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were primarily due to rationalization charges recorded in  higher unit volumes and continued benefits from rationalization and integration activities 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for was million  a decrease of million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings as a result of our prepayment of debt and lower interest rate spreads from the june refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility  partially offset by a higher average cost of borrowings resulting from rising interest rates 
in addition  we incurred a non cash  pre tax charge of million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs resulting from the june refinancing and the prepayment of debt in the fourth quarter of we also incurred a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in as a result of the prepayment of debt 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the effective tax rate was impacted by net adjustments to certain valuation allowances and other tax provisions as a result of the resolution of certain state and foreign tax matters  benefits of the manufacturing credit afforded under the american jobs creation act  as well as the benefits of a tax initiative completed during the second quarter  offset by a tax charge for the repatriation of million of cash from our canadian operations under the american jobs creation act 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments  including our credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our million previous senior secured credit facility by entering into our new billion credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided us with million of a term loans and million of b term loans  and provides us with a revolving loan facility of up to approximately million 
under the credit agreement  we may use revolving loans for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the credit agreement also provides us with an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to an additional million  which may be used to finance acquisitions and for other permitted purposes 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we borrowed additional term loans under the credit agreement of cdn million in primarily to repatriate earnings of our canadian subsidiaries in connection with the american jobs creation act 
in  we borrowed million and cdn million of term loans under the credit agreement to fund our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie  respectively 
term loans under our credit agreement are repayable in scheduled amounts through june  in addition to our mandatory repayments  we made voluntary prepayments of our term loans of million and million  respectively  in and 
table of contents in  we used cash from operations of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  net borrowings of long term debt of million  cash balances of million and proceeds from stock based compensation of million to fund our acquisitions for million  net of cash acquired  net capital expenditures of million  decreases in outstanding checks of million  debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with our additional borrowings under the credit agreement and dividends paid on our common stock of million

in  we used cash from operations of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and increases in outstanding checks of million to fund net capital expenditures of million  payments of scheduled debt installments of million and voluntary debt prepayments of million under our previous senior secured credit facility  net repayments of revolving loans of million  dividends paid on common stock of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the cash payments for dividends in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  the cash payment for this quarterly dividend is expected to be approximately million 
revolving loans under our credit agreement may be used for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed over the life of our credit agreement until their final maturity on june  at december  and  there were no revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
after taking into account letters of credit of million  borrowings available under the revolving loan facility of our credit agreement were million on december  because we sell metal containers used in the fruit and vegetable packing process  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  and  the average amount of revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement  including seasonal borrowings  was million  million and million  respectively  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the highest amount of such borrowings was million  million and million  respectively 
the peak borrowing amount does not include million of revolving loans borrowed under our credit agreement to repay term loans in connection with the june refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of to million  principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in and million in  
table of contents cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  and payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which may increase annually thereafter 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
the credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current tax law  there are no minimum required contributions to our pension plans in however  this is subject to change based on a number of factors  including in the event that asset performance is significantly below the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
during  although we had no minimum required contributions  we made pension contributions of million 

table of contents at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account us and euro interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent and receive floating rates of interest based on three month libor or euribor  as appropriate 
these agreements mature as follows million and million in  million and million in  million in and million in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges and acquisition reserves in february  we approved and announced a plan to exit our valencia  california plastic container manufacturing facility 
the plan included the termination of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs 
this decision resulted in a charge to earnings during of million for employee severance and benefits  million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets and million for plant exit costs 
the plant has ceased operations and all cash has been expended 
in june  in an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs  we approved a plan to exit our st 
paul  minnesota metal food container manufacturing facility in the second quarter of the plan includes the termination of approximately employees  the consolidation of certain operations into existing facilities  the elimination of the remaining operations and the exit of the facility 
we estimate that the total costs for the rationalization of this facility will be million 
these costs include million of non cash pension and postretirement curtailment expense  million of employee severance and special termination benefits  million for plant exit costs  million for the acceleration of depreciation to write down the building for sale and equipment for abandonment upon the exit of the facility and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
total charges recognized during were million for non cash pension and postretirement curtailment expense  million for employee severance and special termination benefits and million for the non cash write down and accelerated depreciation of the building and equipment 
additional charges of million are expected primarily in cash expenditures of million are expected primarily in in october  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our stockton  california metal food container manufacturing facility at the end of the second quarter of the plan includes the 
table of contents termination or relocation of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs 
we estimate total rationalization charges for the plan of million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
rationalization charges recognized during were million for the estimated cost to withdraw from the multi employer pension plan  million for employee severance and benefits and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
total cash payments of million are expected primarily in in addition  we expect to sell the stockton building in for estimated proceeds in excess of the net book value of the facility 
under these rationalization plans and other rationalization and acquisition plans initiated in previous years  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional cash spending of approximately million is expected for our plans  primarily in you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities in our business  including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings 
we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we increased our domestic discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent in historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of 
table of contents the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  utilizing the modified prospective transition method  which does not result in the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
therefore  for the year ended december  we recognized compensation expense based on the requirements of sfas no
