item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  below 
types of contracts while the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably  generally we perform our work under two groups of contracts cost reimbursable contracts  and guaranteed maximum or fixed price contracts 
in some markets  we are seeing hybrid contracts containing both fixed price and cost reimbursable elements 
as of december   the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog backlog in millions cost reimbursable guaranteed maximum and fixed price under cost reimbursable contracts  the client reimburses our cost in developing a project and pays us a pre determined fee or a fee based upon a percentage of the cost incurred in completing the project 
our profit may be in the form of a fee  a simple mark up applied to labor cost incurred in performing the contract  or a combination of the two 
the fee element may also vary 
the fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors  milestones or targets  it may be a fixed amount in the contract  or it may be based upon a percentage of the cost incurred 
our government segment  as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of united states government programs  generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts although subject to applicable statutes and regulations 
in many cases  these contracts include incentive fee arrangements 
the programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts 
despite the fact that these programs are generally awarded on a multi year basis  the funding for the programs is generally approved on an annual basis by congress 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  or funds for a program may even be eliminated thereby significantly curtailing or stopping a program 
some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq agreements 
under these arrangements  we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend 
while the scope is often not initially fully defined or requires any specific amount of work  once the project scope is determined  additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding 
guaranteed maximum price contracts  or gmax contracts  are performed in a manner similar to cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price 
we can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price 
where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price  we will receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client 
fixed price contacts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum contracts 
under negotiated fixed price contracts  we are selected as contractor first  and then we negotiate price with the client 
these types of contracts generally occur where we commence work before a final price is agreed upon 
under lump sum contracts  we bid on a contract based upon specifications provided by the client against competitors  agreeing to develop a project at a fixed price 
another type of fixed price contract is a so called unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every unit of work performed 
in some fixed price contracts  we can benefit from some of the cost savings depending upon whether the client is willing to bear some of the risk if the actual cost exceeds the contract award 
as a result  if we perform well  we can benefit from cost savings  however  if the project does not proceed as originally planned  we cannot recover cost overruns except in certain limited situations 
competition we are one of the world s larger providers of engineering  procurement and construction services 
the markets served by our business are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of companies are competing in the markets served by our business  including us based companies such as bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  inc  kbr inc  chicago bridge and iron company nv  chm hill companies limited  parsons corporation  the shaw group and washington group international  and international companies such as foster wheeler ltd  technip and amec plc 
in the engineering and construction arena  our competition is primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
our engineering  procurement and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity  reputation for quality  technology  cost effectiveness  worldwide procurement capability  project management expertise  geographic coverage and ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis  ability to execute projects of varying sizes  strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies 
the various markets served by the global services segment  while having some similarities  tend also to have discrete issues particularly impacting individual units 
each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets 
in the equipment sector  which operates in numerous markets  the equipment industry is highly fragmented and very competitive  with most competitors operating in specific geographic areas 
the competition for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment  tool and management services 
temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over  companies competing nationally 
the key competitive factors in this business line are price  service  quality  breadth of service and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage 
the barriers to entry in operations and maintenance are both financially and logistically low with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant 
competition is generally driven by reputation  price and the capacity to perform 
key competitive factors in our government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
significant customers for  and  revenue earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
however  we are not dependent on any single federal agency or upon any other single customer on an on going basis  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
except for the united states federal government  no other single customer accounted for over of our revenue in any of the last three years 
raw materials the principal raw materials we use in our business include structural steel  metal plate and concrete 
these and the other raw materials and the components we use and which are necessary for the conduct of our business are generally available from numerous sources 
we do not foresee any unavailability of raw materials and components that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term 
however  the price and availability of these raw materials and components may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including customer demand  producer capacity  market conditions and material shortages and cost 
research and development while we engage in research and development efforts in the development of new products and services  during the past three fiscal years  we have not incurred cost for company sponsored research and development activities which would be material  special or unusual in any of our business segments 
patents we hold patents and licenses for certain items that we use in our operations 
however  none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business 
environmental  safety and health matters we believe  based upon present information available to us  that our accruals with respect to future environmental cost are adequate and any future cost will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
some factors  however could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures 
these include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes regarding site cleanup cost or the allocation of such cost among potentially responsible parties  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified 
number of employees the following table sets forth the number of employees of fluor and its subsidiaries engaged in our business segments as of december  total employees salaried employees oil gas industrial infrastructure government global services power other total salaried craft and hourly employees total the number of craft and hourly employees  who provide support throughout the various business segments  varies in relation to the number and size of projects we have in process at any particular time

item a 
risk factors we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
the demand for our services and products is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
although downturns can impact our entire business  our telecommunications and power markets exemplify businesses that are cyclical in nature and have recently been affected by a decrease in worldwide demand for these projects although we believe the power market is now in an upturn 
industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
during economic downturns  our clients may demand better terms 
in addition  our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in these industries 
intense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits 
we serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete 
among our competitors are us companies such as bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  inc  kbr inc  chicago bridge and iron company nv  chm hill companies limited  parsons corporation  the shaw group and washington group international  and international companies such as foster wheeler ltd  technip and amec plc 
in particular  the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment  technology and skilled personnel 
competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins 
intense competition is expected to continue in these markets  presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins 
if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits 
we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately of the dollar value of our contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if cost increase above our estimates 
we conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements 
in terms of dollar value  the majority of our contracts allocate the risk of cost overruns to our client by requiring our client to reimburse us for our cost 
approximately of the dollar value of our contracts are currently guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts  where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  cost of raw materials  our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
as of december   our backlog was approximately billion 
we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them 
therefore  project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits 
if we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project  we could incur additional cost to cover our guarantee obligations 
in some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
we sometimes provide that the project  when completed  will also achieve certain performance standards 
from time to time  we may also assume a project s technical risk  which means that we may have to satisfy certain technical requirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award  we may not have previously produced the system or product in question 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay or the cost to cause the project to achieve the performance standards  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total cost of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits 
we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
in addition  the nature of our business results in clients  subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of cost they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually liable 
we have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
these claims generally arise in the normal course of our business 
when it is determined that we have liability  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
our professional liability coverage is on a claims made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect 
in addition  even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any liability not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material effect on us 
we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional cost exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional cost  both direct and indirect 
often  these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
we maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads 
if we do not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed  significant cost may result 
our estimates of future performance depend on  among other matters  whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards 
while our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment  these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur cost resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that would have the effect of reducing our profits 
we have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties 
unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased cost and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control 
as of december   approximately of our projected backlog consisted of engineering and construction revenue to be derived from facilities to be constructed in other countries  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of special risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  trade restrictions  tax increases  currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  united states government policies  and international hostilities 
the lack of a well developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each such project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our overall revenue and profits 
we work in international locations where there are high security risks  which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 
some of our services are performed in high risk locations  such as iraq and haiti  where the country or location is subject to political  social or economic risks  or war or civil unrest 
in those locations where we have employees or operations  we may incur substantial security cost to maintain the safety of our personnel 
moreover  despite these activities  in these locations  we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel 
our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel 
over the past year  the demand for employees who engage and are experienced in the services we perform has continued to grow as our customers have increased their capital expenditures and the use of our services 
the success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract and retain personnel  including engineers  corporate management and craft employees  who have the necessary and required experience and expertise 
competition for these kinds of personnel is intense 
our government contracts may be terminated at any time 
also  if we do not comply with restrictions and regulations imposed by the government  our government contracts may be terminated and we may be unable to enter into future government contracts 
the termination of our government contracts could significantly reduce our expected revenue 
we enter into significant government contracts  from time to time  such as those that we have with the us department of energy at hanford 
government contracts are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions and regulations  including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls  which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 
our government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
for example  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation far  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards cas  the service contract act and department of defense security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping and accounting 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 
we also run the risk of the impact of government audits  investigations and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the federal false claims act that  if an unfavorable result occurs  could impact our profits and financial condition  as well as our ability to obtain future government work 
for example  government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency the dcaa routinely review and audit government contractors 
if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated  a variety of penalties can be imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 
the dcaa has the ability to review how we have accounted for cost under the far and cas  and if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities  payments to us may be disallowed 
if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience  if we are suspended from government contract work  or if payment of our cost is disallowed  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue and profits 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our financial statements 
in addition  prior to the reverse spin off involving our former coal segment  our predecessor in interest received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the reverse spin off qualified as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the ruling was granted based upon certain representations made by our predecessor in interest 
while we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause those representations to be incorrect or incomplete  if those representations were inaccurate  it is possible that the ruling would no longer be valid 
in such event  we could incur a significant corporate tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose significant additional cost on us that reduce our profits 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations 
our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  past activities could also have a material impact on us 
for example  when we sold our mining business formerly conducted through st 
joe minerals corporation  we retained responsibility for certain non lead related environmental liabilities  but only to the extent that such liabilities were not covered by st 
joe s comprehensive general liability insurance 
while we are not currently aware of any material exposure arising from our former st 
joe s business or otherwise  the cost of complying with rulings and regulations or satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible could be substantial and could reduce our profits 
a substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters 
a reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations  or changes in government policies regarding the funding  implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations  could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels 
the success of our joint ventures depend on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we enter into various joint ventures as part of our engineering  procurement and construction businesses  including ica fluor and project specific joint ventures 
the success of these and other joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
if our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
if we are unable to form teaming arrangements  our ability to compete for and win certain contracts may be negatively impacted 
in both the private and public sectors  either acting as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor  we may join with other firms to form a team to compete for a single contract 
because a team can offer stronger combined qualifications than any firm standing alone  these teaming arrangements can be very important to the success of a particular contract bid process or proposal 
the failure to maintain such relationships in certain markets  such as the nuclear energy market  may impact our ability to win work 
we are dependent upon third parties to complete many of our contracts 
much of the work performed under our contracts is actually performed by third party subcontractors we hire 
we also rely on third party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects 
if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers  our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated  especially in a lump sum or a fixed price type contract  we may suffer losses on these contracts 
if a supplier  manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies  equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason  we may be required to source these supplies  equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations or liquidity 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits 
under our accounting procedures  we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits and revenue under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenue and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost expected to be incurred 
the effect of revisions to revenue and estimated cost is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated  and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material 
on a historical basis  we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long term contracts 
however  given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual cost to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits 
some of our projects and new business may be located in environments where anti corruption initiatives are not followed 
we often perform our projects in countries with less robust legal systems or which are in the developmental stage 
transparency international  an international organization which reviews potential governmental and institutional corruption  has rated many of the countries poorly in terms of their acceptance of corruption and their enforcement of anti corruption laws and rules 
it is the policy of the company to comply with all applicable anti bribery laws of the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and the applicable laws of all foreign countries in which we operate 
under the fcpa  among other things  us based companies such as fluor and our agents or other intermediaries are precluded from offering anything of value to foreign officials or governments with the intent of obtaining or retaining business  or to otherwise obtain an improper advantage 
we train our staff concerning fcpa issues  and we also inform our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with fcpa requirements 
we also have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and or acquisitions  and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all  which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives 
to the extent that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  are insufficient to make future investments  make acquisitions or provide needed additional working capital  we may require additional financing from other sources 
our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions  as well as conditions in our business and our operating results  and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to make future investments  take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities  or respond to competitive challenges 
we continue to expand our business in areas where bonding is required  but bonding capacity is limited 
we continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded  especially in the transportation infrastructure arena 
these bonds indemnify the customer if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
failure to provide a bond on terms required by a customer may result in an inability to compete for or win a project 
historically  we have had a strong bonding capacity but  as is typically the case  bonding is at the surety s sole discretion 
in addition  because of the overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity  we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract required bonding 
in addition  these contracts are often very large and extremely complex  which often necessitates the use of a joint venture  often with a competitor  to bid on and perform these types of contracts  especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding 
however  entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risks of third parties  many of whom are not as financially strong as we are 
if our joint venturers or partners fail to perform  we could suffer negative results 
it can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations 
as part of business operations  we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and in order to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts 
although we have in the past been generally able to cover our insurance needs  there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future 
any future acquisitions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions will be successful 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we also may encounter difficulties diligencing or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
in the event we make acquisitions using our stock as consideration  we could dilute share ownership 
as we have announced  we intend to grow our business not only organically but also potentially through acquisitions 
one method of paying for acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  the issuance could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and shareholders percentage ownership 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
various anti takeover provisions under delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  certain provisions of our bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  vacancies on the board can only be filled by other directors  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
as a holding company  we are dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to fund debt payments 
because we are a holding company  we have no true operations or significant assets other than the stock we own of our subsidiaries 
we depend on dividends  loans and other distributions from these subsidiaries to be able to pay our debt and other financial obligations 
contractual limitations and legal regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions or loans to us or  if made  may be insufficient to cover our financial obligations  or to pay interest or principal when due on our debt 
systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 
as a global company  we are heavily reliant on computer  information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate 
from time to time  we experience system interruptions and delays 
if we are unable to continually add software and hardware  effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems  systems operation could be interrupted or delayed 
in addition  our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failures  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions 
any of these or other events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data  could delay or prevent operations  and could adversely affect our operating results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  operating profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
results of operations summary of overall company results during  revenue increased by percent compared with this increase is the primary result of higher project execution activities in the oil gas  global services and power segments and work being performed in continuing support of the federal emergency management agency fema for hurricane relief efforts that started in the level of fema activity declined in the second half of  as the company s work on hurricane relief efforts was completed 
additionally  a large department of energy doe project has been completed 
these factors  plus lower activity in iraq  resulted in reduced revenue in the second half of for the government segment  which was largely offset by revenue growth in the other segments 
earnings before taxes for increased by percent compared with the company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years 
the oil gas and global services segments are benefiting from this trend  as reflected in improved operating results 
additionally  during the industrial infrastructure segment returned to profitability after reporting an operating loss for partially offsetting these operating profit improvements during were provisions totaling million on fixed price projects in the government segment 
provisions for losses on certain fixed price embassy projects totaling million were recognized in  in addition to provisions totaling million during the embassy projects have been subject to significant cost increases resulting from schedule extensions  scope changes  client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
civil unrest impacting the project in haiti has also caused significant schedule delays resulting in increased cost 
in addition to the provisions on the embassy projects  provisions totaling million were recognized during for cost overruns due to difficulties with a subcontractor on a fixed price project in afghanistan 
see further discussion of the embassy and afghanistan provisions under government below 
during  revenue and earnings before taxes increased by percent and percent  respectively  compared with all of the company s business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels in the previous years 
contributing to results in the oil gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the project 
this performance was  however  partially offset by an operating loss in the industrial infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects 
revenue improved in the government segment due to higher activity in iraq and in support of the fema hurricane relief efforts  however  operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to the embassy project losses discussed above 
earnings before taxes for included gains of million from the sale of the former corporate facility and other real estate assets and a provision in the amount of million for foreign employment related taxes primarily on behalf of certain united states expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions 
approximately million of the charge was recognized in the oil gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in industrial infrastructure and minor amounts in the government and global services segments 
earnings before taxes were million in  million in and million in during  us earnings before taxes increased significantly primarily due to fema activity  while embassy project losses reduced non us earnings before taxes 
the effective tax rates for  and were approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively 
variability in effective tax rates in recent years is discussed below under corporate and tax matters 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared with per share in and per share in consolidated new awards for were billion  compared with billion during and billion in the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments had increases in new awards during  partially offset by lower new awards in the global services  government and power segments 
consolidated backlog at december  of billion was percent higher compared with backlog of billion at december  consolidated backlog was essentially unchanged at december  compared with december  for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate and tax matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared with total estimated contract cost 
this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog is cost reimbursable while percent is for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees  as well as increases in contract cost can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable cost  which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for costs 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  deferrals and revised project scope and cost  both upward and downward 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue  cost and operating profit in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
frequently  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards  and may reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events 
foreign currency the company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in us dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred 
as a result  the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed 
under certain limited circumstances  such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives 
as of december  and  the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts 
managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies 
the company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure 
the objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december  the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for non us subsidiaries  and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
in june  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
also  the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of the company continues to evaluate the impact of fin but does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the financial statements 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
the extended period of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved  future funding obligations could increase substantially 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
this statement amends sfas and requires that the funded status of plans  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligations  be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic benefit cost 
the statement was adopted in and resulted in a million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which reduced shareholders equity 
share based payment the company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders 
types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock  stock options and stock appreciation rights 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and prohibits the recording of additional capital from restricted stock until those instruments vest 
with the adoption of sfas r  pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of sfas r generally apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement  which was january  for the company 
the company has elected the modified prospective method of application and  accordingly  has not restated previously reported financial condition  operating results or the presentation of cash flows 
the elimination of additional capital associated with unvested restricted shares resulted in an offsetting reversal of unamortized executive stock plan expense upon implementation of sfas r 
additionally  the presentation of cash flows for has been modified to reflect the benefits of tax deductions for stock compensation in excess of recognized compensation cost as financing cash flows  with an offsetting amount in operating cash flows  as now required 
during the year ended december   the company recognized pretax compensation expense  including the impact on expense of retirement eligibility discussed below  of million per diluted share after tax associated with stock options 
the per share fair value of such options was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
previously under apb  no compensation cost was recognized for unvested stock options where the grant price was equal to the market price on the date of grant and the vesting provisions were based only on the passage of time 
had sfas r been adopted in and  the impacts would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company has not historically considered retirement eligibility in determining stock based compensation expense  including expense associated with stock options and restricted stock 
the adoption of sfas r required the company to assume the first date on which an employee becomes eligible to retire in determining the amortization period for stock based awards 
for example  if the employee is eligible for retirement two years from the date of grant  the amortization period will be no longer than two years rather than the specified service period over which awards normally vest 
retirement eligibility has been considered in the determination of periodic expense on a prospective basis for current year awards  and compensation expense associated with awards granted in prior periods has continued to be recognized using historical straight line amortization practices based on award specific vesting periods 
the impact of using retirement eligibility in determining all stock option expense would have been to decrease the pro forma adjustments by approximately percent and percent  respectively  for the years ended december  and the impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for all restricted stock awards would have been to increase recorded restricted stock amortization expense by approximately one third during and the impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for stock option and restricted stock awards was to increase pretax amortization expense by approximately million and million  respectively  for an aggregate after tax impact of per diluted share for the year ended december  segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance epcm and is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides design  engineering  procurement  construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides design  engineering  procurement and construction professional services for transportation projects  mining  life sciences facilities  telecommunications projects  manufacturing facilities  commercial and institutional  microelectronics and healthcare facilities 
the government segment provides project management  engineering  construction and contingency response services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance  small capital project execution  equipment  industrial fleet outsourcing  plant turnaround  temporary staffing  strategic sourcing and construction related support services 
the power segment provides professional services to the gas  solid fuel  nuclear and plant betterment marketplace 
oil gas revenue in the oil gas segment amounted to billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
increased levels of project execution activities during more than replaced the million of revenue that was recognized in from the settlement of a project dispute in venezuela 
the percent increase in revenue during resulted from the strength of new contract awards that has accompanied the increased level of global oil and gas exploration and refining and also included the project settlement 
operating profit margin in the oil gas segment was percent in compared with percent in and percent in the operating margin in includes the impact of favorable project performance during the year  as well as an increase in the level of higher margin front end engineering and design work 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in the segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations  which are very well suited for fluor s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
new project awards in included a billion refinery expansion in the united states  a billion project in saudi arabia and a project in excess of billion in qatar 
new project awards in included billion for two large international petrochemical projects  billion for a gas complex in the united arab emirates and million from a canadian oil sands project 
new project awards in included a million oil sands project and a million clean fuels project  which are both in canada  a million refinery complex modernization project in mexico and a million refinery upgrade project in south africa 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion at december   up sequentially from billion at december  and billion at december  the and growth relate principally to the continued strength of new awards and positive project scope adjustments to existing projects 
total assets in the oil gas segment increased to million at december  from million at december  due to additional working capital associated with the continued increase in the level of project execution activities 
total assets of the segment decreased during from million at the end of  reflecting the net impact of the project settlement  partially offset by additional working capital associated with the increased level of project execution activities 
industrial infrastructure the industrial infrastructure segment had revenue of billion in each of the years ended december  and and billion in although revenue remained fairly constant in total for and  the mix of new business in the current year has shifted somewhat from manufacturing facilities to large infrastructure and mining projects that generally have longer execution periods 
this has resulted in significant growth in backlog to billion as of december  revenue increased significantly during  primarily as the result of the strength of contract awards 
the segment reported an operating profit of million for  compared with an operating loss of million in and an operating profit of million for the improvement during includes the favorable impacts of successful project performance  improved margins on more recent projects and overhead spending reductions 
operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects 
the segment participates in a joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
the project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays  resulting in additional cost 
during  and  provisions of million  million and million  respectively  were recorded due to increasing estimated cost 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost  as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project 
to date  the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately million to the client 
cost of million has been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of december  and the company has recognized its million proportionate share of this cost in revenue 
the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of during  a charge relating to the resolution of a cayman islands project was recognized 
on june   fluor daniel caribbean  inc fd caribbean received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the caribbean 
fd caribbean was the general contractor on the project  which is located in the cayman islands 
as a consequence  the segment recorded a million charge in the second quarter of to recognize the jury award  estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project 
at the time of the original jury decision  the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law 
on september   the judge who tried the case granted the company s motion for a new trial  setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality 
on september   in lieu of a new trial  the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side and the action was dismissed with prejudice 
as a result  million of the second quarter charge was reversed in the third quarter of  resulting in a net charge of million for the hotel project settlement during in addition to charges arising from the transportation infrastructure and cayman islands projects discussed above  during the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately million relating to a number of other projects that had been the subject of dispute resolution activities 
these losses included settlements on a resort hotel project in the bahamas and two life sciences projects 
the projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company 
where the company had determined that cost incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner  the company made claims against the owners for recovery of cost incurred 
dispute resolution activities were concluded on these matters and settlements finalized during several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred cost deemed to be unrecoverable  including certain legal fees  was recognized in the company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its london connect project lul  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the london underground system 
in february  the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues 
first  the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project 
the arbitration hearings on the claim that relates to the contract time period of through has been held and an interim decision from the arbitrator was received in december the parties have each filed appeals relating to certain aspects of the decision and further hearings on those issues are expected in the spring of a claim for delay and disruption for the through time period has been submitted to the dispute resolution process 
reflecting the interim outcome for through  the company has recognized million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to the delay and disruption claims 
in addition  the company was assessed and has paid million representing its share of liquidated damages 
this payment has not been recognized as a reduction in project revenue because it is expected that amounts assessed will be substantially recovered upon resolution of the company s claims 
the second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment 
the hearings on this issue have concluded and resulted in sustaining the company s position that it did not have any responsibility for costs associated with this portion of the work under the contract 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion in and billion during new awards during increased across most of the segment s business lines  with new mining projects representing approximately percent of the total 
the lower level of new awards in includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards 
new awards in included a variety of mining  life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world 
backlog for the industrial infrastructure segment increased to billion at the end of from billion at the end of for  ending backlog was billion 
the decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects 
total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment increased to million at december  from million at december  as the principal result of revenue recognized in connection with the national roads telecommunications services project discussed below under financial position and liquidity 
government the government segment had revenue of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue in all three years includes reconstruction activity in iraq and work for environmental restoration  engineering  construction  site operations and maintenance services at two major doe sites the fernald environmental management project fernald in ohio  which was completed in  and the ongoing hanford environmental management project in washington 
revenue during and includes hurricane relief activities in support of fema 
the six percent increase in revenue in compared with resulted from the continuation of hurricane relief activities in support of fema  which commenced in the second half of  partially offset by reduced iraq reconstruction and doe project activity 
the level of fema activity increased during early  but began to decline in the third and fourth quarters of the year  as the company s work on hurricane relief efforts was completed 
the decline in doe activity resulted largely from the completion of the fernald project at the end of october  the percent increase in revenue during resulted principally from new fema contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the gulf of mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in iraq 
the operating profit for the government segment during was million  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
operating profit contribution during from fema contracts was more than offset by loss provisions totaling million on the projects discussed below 
although operating profit increased due to the year s revenue growth  that improvement was largely offset by loss provisions on the embassy projects discussed below 
the company has been performing work on embassy projects for the united states department of state under fixed price contracts over the last three years 
these projects have been adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions  scope changes causing material deviations from the standard embassy design  increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
as of december   projects in kazakhstan  jamaica and belize were completed and the facilities are occupied  bringing the total to nine embassies that have been completed 
the project in greece will be completed in early and  as of january   the physical completion of the haiti embassy has progressed to approximately percent 
during  the company recognized provisions totaling million for estimated cost overruns on these projects  including substantial amounts relating to the embassy in haiti  where periods of civil unrest have resulted in significant unanticipated schedule delays and cost increases 
in addition  at the site in haiti  increased cost has resulted from collapsible soil conditions  additional client imposed requirements and subsequent increases in material quantities and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
the company recognized provisions for estimated cost overruns on certain of the embassy projects totaling million in claims for equitable adjustment on seven of the projects totaling approximately million have been submitted or identified to date 
as the first formal step in dispute resolution  the majority of these claims have now been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements 
as of december   million in cost relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue 
additional claims continue to be evaluated 
in addition to the provisions on the embassy projects  provisions totaling million were recognized during for subcontractor cost overruns on a fixed price project at the bagram air force base in afghanistan 
due to performance and quality issues  the primary subcontractor s scope has been substantially reduced and the estimated cost to complete the project using alternative resources has further escalated 
the provisions include the estimated impact of schedule delays and limited site access due to client imposed restrictions 
the project is estimated to be completed in mid new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared with billion during and billion in during the past two years new awards have included emergency response work for fema  reconstruction activities in iraq and the environmental restoration work at two doe sites 
many projects performed on behalf of us government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months for annually funded contracts 
backlog declined during to million from billion in and billion in as the result of progress towards completion on the fernald and iraq contracts 
fema awards have generally been performed very quickly and therefore have not significantly impacted backlog from one period to the next 
the company no longer pursues projects in the embassy market 
total assets in the government segment were million at december   down from million at december  this decrease was the principal result of progress towards completion on the fema and iraq reconstruction contracts 
during  segment assets increased from million at december  this increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to fema and iraq reconstruction projects  deferred cost associated with embassy claims and unbilled fees on the fernald project 
the segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling million on the fernald project at december   up from million at the end of and million at the end of the unbilled fees  of which million are included in other current assets and million are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   reflect the favorable impact of accelerated completion and will be billed and collected upon the completion of project close out activities 
collection of substantially all of the unbilled fees is expected in the first half of global services the global services segment had revenue of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase occurred broadly across the segment s business 
increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities were the primary drivers of the increase 
the segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models 
operating profit for the global services segment was million in compared with million in and million in the increase reflects the strong business environment extending across most of global services markets as well as the favorable impact of hurricane recovery activities 
operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and respectively 
the decline during resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segment s various service lines 
the equipment  temporary staffing  strategic sourcing and construction services business lines do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue 
accordingly  new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only 
in recent years  global services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from short duration operations and maintenance activities and from other business not traditionally reported in backlog 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  billion during and billion during new awards in included two large multi year operations and maintenance awards 
during  backlog for the global services segment declined to billion  compared with billion at the end of contributing to the backlog decline was the execution in of a substantial portion of a fixed duration contract 
backlog increased percent during  from billion at december  this growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph  although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of million in materials cost from backlog during total assets in the global services segment increased to million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  as the principal result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth 
power the power segment reported revenue in  and  of million  million and million  respectively 
revenue levels in recent years have been negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in operating profit margin in the power segment declined to percent during from percent during and percent in the lower margin was the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of the dearborn industrial project discussed below  a loss on another project  a concentration of projects that are in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market 
although the power market is entering an expansion phase  that has not yet translated to significantly improved operating performance for the segment 
the margin includes the negative impact of a loss on one project  partly offset by successful project close out activities on a number of other projects 
the margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion  where profit recognition is strongest  and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in the favorable results were partly offset by unexpected cost associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning 
projects in the power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution  but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
the dearborn industrial project the project was a co generation combined cycle power plant project in dearborn  michigan that was executed by the duke fluor daniel partnership 
the owner operator  dearborn industrial generation dig  issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project 
the project was severely delayed and dig unilaterally took over completion and operation of the plant 
shortly thereafter  dig drew upon a million letter of credit 
subsequently  the matter was referred to arbitration and in december duke fluor daniel was awarded a net amount of million 
the award included full recovery of the letter of credit and certain other cost  but the arbitrators unexpectedly awarded dig certain amounts 
the company recognized a provision of million in the fourth quarter of representing its proportionate share of the overall shortfall in recovery 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount  but occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of million during include a plant retrofit project in south carolina 
new awards of billion during included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in kentucky and a megawatt power plant in nevada 
new awards of million in included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in south africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in nevada 
backlog for the power segment increased sequentially to billion at december  from billion at december  and from million at december   reflecting growth in the number of projects in progress 
total assets in the power segment increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december   due to additional working capital associated with the higher level of project execution activities 
corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   corporate administrative and general expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
included in these amounts are non operating expenses of million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during and non operating income of million for each year and the and amounts relate primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties in both years and a gain from disposal of a residual property interest in corporate administrative and general expense  excluding non operating items  increased percent in and one percent in the increase includes million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard 
additionally  during  expenses recorded with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters increased by million 
on may   the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from southern california to the dallas fort worth metropolitan area

approximately employees in southern california who did not relocate to texas left the company 
the cost of these employee displacements was accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of through the date of the employee departures 
all other relocation and hiring cost has been charged to expense as incurred 
total relocation cost included in corporate administrative and general expense was million and million during and  respectively 
the corporate facility in aliso viejo was sold in september a short term  market rate lease back agreement that was negotiated with the buyer terminated on june  the cost to construct the new texas headquarters totaled million and was funded from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the former headquarters facility 
net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease was the net result of interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of that were required to support project execution activities  an increase in the interest rates on those commercial paper borrowings and the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt starting in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by higher cash balances and investment interest rates during the second half of the year 
higher interest income in related principally to larger investment balances and higher short term interest rates 
tax the effective tax rates on the company s pretax earnings were percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion  a domestic production activities deduction related to domestic construction projects and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of associated tax benefits  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes 
the comparatively low tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the internal revenue service  tax benefits associated with the dividends made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the ajca as more fully discussed below and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns 
these items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in addition  the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit 
these aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely 
during  the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan 
accordingly  the tax rate reflects the us tax effect on these earnings 
on october   the ajca was signed into law 
among its various provisions  the ajca creates a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an percent dividends received deduction  subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations 
on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp allows companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the ajca was enacted to evaluate the effect of the ajca on a company s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings for the purpose of applying statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

the plan was ratified by the executive committee of the company s board of directors on august  on september   approximately million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company  including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the ajca 
the results of operations for included a tax benefit of million attributable to the dividends received deduction  net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction

general electric company  et al in october  fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against general electric company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as saudi american general electric  a saudi arabian corporation 
the complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement  engineering and construction of the rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia 
subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter  the company initiated arbitration proceedings in new york under the american arbitration association international rules 
the evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded 
in january the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases  the first to be a decision on entitlement and second  a decision on damages 
on may  the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed fluor s entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for cost incurred in construction of the plant 
a decision determining the amount recoverable has yet to be issued by the arbitration panel 
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operating activities during was million compared with million in operating activities utilized million during the amount includes million collected in connection with the close out of a project in venezuela 
the company used significant cash in to fund ongoing work and change orders relating to this project and the completion of nearly all work on power segment projects that were being executed through the duke fluor daniel partnership 
the company jointly announced with duke energy corporation in  the decision to dissolve the partnership 
the dissolution has been largely completed with no significant impact on cash flows 
the levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix  stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects 
the increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients 
as work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin  cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion 
liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress 
as customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects  the company s cash position will be reduced 
in the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows 
cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the company s defined contribution and defined benefit plans 
while contributions to defined contribution plans have increased over the past three years in response to increases in the number of eligible employees  contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability  at million in compared with million in and million in the large contributions in were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans 
one plan that was not fully funded in received a contribution totaling million during  which provided full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of the end of that year 
as of december  and all plans are funded to the level of accumulated benefits 
cash flows from investing activities during and included million and million  respectively  from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest 
during  and  million  million and million  respectively were received from the disposal of other property  plant and equipment 
property disposals relate primarily to ongoing renewal and replacements in the global services segment 
the acquisition of trend western utilized cash of million during cash utilized by investing activities in  and included capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures include million in and million in for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in texas  but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the global services segment that support engineering and construction projects 
the increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to the ongoing renewal and replacement in the construction equipment operations  rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in iraq in and and hurricane recovery in the united states during capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the global services segment  renewal and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the company s continuing investment in automated systems 
new engineering and construction joint ventures of the industrial infrastructure segment in the united kingdom during required capital contributions totaling approximately million 
during  the company amended and restated its senior credit facility  increasing the size from million to billion and extending the maturity to during  the company issued million of percent convertible senior notes the notes due  realizing net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and million was used to obtain ownership of the aliso viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing 
ownership of the calgary  canada facilities was also obtained during through the payoff of million of lease financing using available canadian cash balances 
in december  the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the notes in cash if a specified trading price of the company s common stock the trigger price is achieved and maintained for a specified period and the notes are presented by the holders for conversion 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of december  and the company does not know the amount  if any  of the notes that will be presented for conversion  and will use available cash balances to satisfy any required repayments 
in december  the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to million of any combination of debt securities or common stock  the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement  the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes

there is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program 
in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend payable april  to per share 
subsequent dividends have continued at this rate 
quarterly cash dividends declared totaled per share in both and declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared 
however  for the dividend paid to shareholders as of january   payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of december  resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of the payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the company s board of directors 
during and  exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the company s international operations strengthened against the us dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income 
during the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the us dollar  and unrealized translation losses occurred 
unrealized gains of million in and million in and unrealized losses of million in primarily relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the us dollar 
because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies  the company s exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal 
the company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs 
cash on hand  short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity 
for the next months  cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations 
off balance sheet arrangements including contractual obligations the company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts 
the company has billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit 
letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts 
at december   the company had utilized million of its letter of credit capacity 
in addition  the company has million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes 
the company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms  primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts 
contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows amount of commitment expiration per period contractual obligations total year or less years years over years in millions debt convertible senior notes municipal bonds equity bridge loan non recourse project finance debt interest on all obligations operating leases pension minimum funding other post employment benefits other compensation related obligations guarantee of pollution control bonds total interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table 
interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted 
operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in sugar land  texas  the united kingdom and various other u 
s and international locations  equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property 
the company generally provides funding to its us and non us pension plans based on the minimum required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in management s judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated 
where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations  additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources 
principally deferred executive compensation 
the company has a joint venture arrangement to design  build  finance and maintain an aircraft refueling facility at a united states air force base in qatar for the defense energy support center  an agency of the department of defense 
the company has a percent interest in the joint venture company 
on april   the joint venture entered into an agreement for project financing which includes a joint and several project completion guarantee by the members of the joint venture 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under the guarantee is million  the maximum principal amount available under the financing arrangement  plus any accrued interest 
the facility has now been completed and was accepted by the customer in january non recourse project financing during  the company s industrial infrastructure segment was awarded a million project by a joint venture  genesys telecommunications limited genesys  which is consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the project was entered into with the united kingdom secretary of state for transport the highways agency to design  build  maintain and finance a new integrated transmission network throughout england s motorways 
the project will be executed by genesys in which the company owns a percent interest and hsbc infrastructure fund management limited  which owns a percent interest 
genesys will finance the engineering and construction e c of upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately million million of non recourse debt the term loan facility from a consortium of lenders the banks along with joint venture member capital contributions totaling approximately million million 
the equity contributions by the joint venture members have been provided through equity bridge loans from the banks 
the loans have been guaranteed or secured in proportion to each member s equity participation 
the equity bridge loans are repayable upon completion of the upgrade at which time the equity members are required to fund their contributions to the joint venture  which is expected to occur in based on a qualitative analysis of the operations of genesys and the variable interests of all parties to the arrangement  under the provisions of fin r the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
the company s and consolidated financial statements include the accounts of genesys and accordingly  the non recourse debt provided by the banks totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
included in the amount is million that will become payable in the term loan facility provides for interest only at libor plus a margin of basis points during construction of the upgraded facilities reducing to a margin of basis points after completion of construction and continuing until fully repaid 
commitment fees are payable on unused portions of the facility 
payments commence in and are due in installments over the term of the services period ending in the term loan facility is an obligation of genesys and will never be a debt obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members 
accordingly  in the event of a default on the term loans  the lenders may only look to the resources of genesys for repayment 
the debt will never be repayable from assets of the company beyond its gross million equity investment plus any un remitted profits in the venture 
the contract has been segmented between the e c and operations and maintenance o m portions of the work to be performed 
the e c portion of the work is being accounted for using contract accounting revenue recognition principles 
as of december   a total of million of e c revenue has been recognized  including million during  for which the related receivable is included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue in connection with o m services including on demand services will be recognized as earned through the life of the contract 
guarantees in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities 
the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances 
the maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts 
the amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals billion as of december  amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable 
for cost reimbursable contracts  amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract 
for lump sum or fixed price contracts  this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract 
remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete 
in those cases where cost exceeds the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties  such as owners  co venturers  subcontractors or vendors for claims 
the carrying value of the liability for guarantees is not material 
financial guarantees  made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances  are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower 
most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property  plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay 
as of december   the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately million 
inflation although inflation and cost trends affect the company  its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts 
the company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions  however  management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return 
additionally  a substantial portion of the company s cash balances are maintained in foreign countries 
the company s presently outstanding debt instruments  except non recourse and associated equity bridge loan project finance debt  carry a fixed rate coupon 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations 
outstanding project finance debt is subject to a floating interest rate and  commercial paper  when outstanding  is issued at current short term interest rates  which could result in higher interest cost if such rates increase in the future 
the company does not currently use derivatives  such as swaps  to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments 
the company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation 
at december   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than months duration  to exchange major world currencies for us dollars 
the total gross notional amount of these contracts at december  was million 
during and  exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the company s international operations strengthened against the us dollar  resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income 
during  the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the us dollar  and unrealized translation losses occurred 
because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held  the exposure to realized translation gains or losses is mitigated
