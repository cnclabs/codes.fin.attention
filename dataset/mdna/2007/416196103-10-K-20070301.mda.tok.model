the credit facility allows us to obtain revolving credit loans and provides for the issuance of letters of credit 
for each borrowing under the credit facility  we can generally choose to have the interest rate for that borrowing calculated based on either jpmorgan chase bank s publicly announced new york prime rate or on a eurodollar as defined in the five year credit agreement rate plus a spread 
the spread is determined based on our total debt to ebitda as defined in the five year credit agreement ratio then in effect  and ranges from

we may elect to prepay the term loan facility at any time without incurring any prepayment penalties

as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit facility 
the amount of cash on hand and borrowings available under the credit facility and the term loan facility are influenced by a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  revenue growth  accounts receivable collections  capital expenditures  tax payments  share repurchase  acquisitions and dividends 
based on our current operational plans  we believe that our credit facility and term loan facility  together with cash provided by operating activities  will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures and dividends for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and which require complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
the most significant areas involving management estimates and assumptions are detailed below 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time the service is rendered or the product is delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 
for all sales  we require either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the client  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the client 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of our revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method  as discussed below 
direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services and products 
direct marketing revenue from certain projects and certain services such as database build services  internet web design  market research and analytical services may be billed at hourly rates or a set price 
if billed at a set price  the revenue is recognized 
table of contents 
index to financial statements over the contractual period  using the percentage of completion method by applying the cost to cost or units of delivery method in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
management estimates and judgments are used in connection with the revenue recognized in these instances 
should actual costs differ significantly from the original estimated costs  the timing of revenues and overall profitability of the contract could be impacted 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method constituted less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of our total revenue for the years ended december   and revenue from services such as creative and graphics  printing  personalization of communication pieces using laser and inkjet printing  targeted mail  fulfillment  agency services and transportation logistics are recognized as the work is performed 
revenue is typically based on a set price or rate given to the client 
revenue from the ongoing production and delivery of data is recognized upon completion and delivery of the work and is typically based on a set price or rate 
revenue from database subscriptions is based on a set price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue related to e marketing  lead management  multi channel customer care  inbound and outbound teleservices and technical support is typically billed based on a set price per transaction or service provided 
revenue from these services is recognized as the service or activity is performed 
revenue from software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means we defer revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other clients or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other clients 
the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement 
if the licensing agreement is for a term of one year or less and includes pcs  we recognize the software and the pcs revenue ratably over the term of the license 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our hosted software service transactions 
for certain non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  aicpa sop software revenue recognition 
if not  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the provisions of eitf require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exists 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
this might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized from the arrangement 
shoppers services are considered rendered  and the revenue recognized  when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the mailing material has been received by the united states postal service 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not reflected in our revenues or expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the minimum allowance balance is based on our prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific clients financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability we increased our deductible for individual healthcare claims from  to  and eliminated our aggregate annual claims deductible in we have a  deductible for automobile and general liability claims 
our deductible for workers compensation decreased from million to  in management makes various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense 
if ultimate losses were higher than our estimate at december   earnings would be impacted by up to million  net of taxes 
the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and our deductible levels for that plan year 
periodic changes to the reserve for workers compensation  automobile and general liability are recorded as increases or decreases to insurance expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statement of operations 
periodic changes to the reserve for healthcare are recorded as increases or decreases to employee benefits expense  which is included in the payroll line of our consolidated statement of operations

index to financial statements goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january   goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over to year periods 
beginning january   goodwill is no longer being amortized  but instead is tested for impairment as discussed below 
we assess the impairment of our goodwill in accordance with sfas  by determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
we have identified our reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
fair value is determined using projected discounted future cash flows and cash flow multiple models  based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
both the direct marketing and shoppers segments are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  after the annual forecasting process for the upcoming fiscal year has been completed 
we have not recorded an impairment loss in any of the three years ended december  significant estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow model include weighted average cost of capital and the long term rate of growth for each of our reporting segments 
these estimates require management s judgment 
any significant changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could have an impact on this annual analysis 
at december  and  our goodwill balance was million  net of million of accumulated amortization  and million  net of million of accumulated amortization  respectively 
based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units as of december  were well in excess of the reporting units carrying values 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including in some cases estimating expected term  volatility and dividend yield 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from some of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we recorded total stock based compensation of million for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future 
the adoption of sfas r required us to begin expensing stock options and other stock based compensation which decreased our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
the adoption of sfas r decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately per share 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statements no

index to financial statements requires us to measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our year end balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  we have recorded a noncurrent liability  representing the combined underfunded status of our pension plans  of million dollars on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have also recognized million of other comprehensive income  representing the changes in the funded status of our pension plans during we are in the process of assessing the impact of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our million revolving credit agreement and our million term loan  both of which bear interest at variable rates based on eurodollar rates effective rate of at december  
the million revolving credit agreement has a maturity date of august  at december   our debt balance related to this revolving credit agreement was million 
the million term loan has a maturity date of september  at december   our debt balance related to this term loan was million 
our earnings are also affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of a deferred compensation agreement  which bears interest at variable rates based on prime effective rate of at december  and has a balance of million at december  assuming the actual level of borrowing and deferred compensation balance throughout  and assuming a one percentage point change in the year s average interest rates  it is estimated that our net income would have changed by approximately million 
due to our debt level and deferred compensation balance at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result of our operations in foreign countries 
due to the level of operations in foreign countries  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is not significant to our overall earnings
