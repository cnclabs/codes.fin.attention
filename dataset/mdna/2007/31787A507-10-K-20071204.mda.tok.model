origin of the investigation in late august  our management commenced a preliminary internal review of certain of our historical stock options granted since our initial public offering in november the review was voluntarily initiated by us due to widespread media attention concerning the stock option grant practices of many companies and was not in response to a news report or an investigation concerning finisar by the sec or any other governmental agency 
after management s report on the results of this initial review  the audit committee directed management to conduct a further analysis of certain stock option grants 
thereafter  management reviewed documentation and materials regarding additional option grants and  in early november  identified potential issues with respect to certain annual grants to employees 
as a result  the audit committee determined that it should undertake a more comprehensive investigation of our historical practices for granting and accounting for stock options from the date of our initial public offering through september  the review period 
on november   we issued a press release and filed a current report on form k announcing the commencement of this review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting  and disclosing that our previously filed financial statements could no longer be relied upon 
we also informed the staff of the sec of the commencement of the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting 
scope of the investigation the investigation was commenced under the authority of the audit committee  composed of three independent directors  two of whom also served as members of the compensation committee during a portion of the review period  although they were generally not involved with the approval of grants of stock options to non officer employees 
accordingly  the board of directors determined that the members of the audit committee were independent for purposes of the investigation and that  based on the facts known at that time  none of the audit committee members had conflicts of interest precluding them from acting as independent members of the audit committee 
the investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic accountants collectively  the investigation team 
under the direction of the audit committee  the investigation team reviewed our practices and processes for granting options to officers and directors  and for new hire and annual grants to non officer employees 
specifically  the investigation team initially examined all grants made to members of the board of directors  employees at the level of vice president or higher  and grants made outside of the delegated authority of the stock plan committee described below  including grants to individuals who subsequently left the company  large annual or performance grants  and grants made at one time to more than existing or newly hired employees between and  grants made to individuals who became finisar employees as a result of acquisitions by finisar between and  grants that were entered in our stock option accounting database with a grant date that did not match the date of the original authorizing document ie minutes of meetings of the board of directors or the compensation committee  or unanimous written consents or actions of the stock plan committee  and grants as to which potentially inconsistent evidence of the measurement date was discovered during the course of the investigation 
the only grants made during the review period that were not initially reviewed by the investigation team were grants made in blocks of less than to non officer  non director grantees 
in the course of reviewing grants made in blocks to or more grantees  the investigation team expanded the scope of the investigation to review 
table of contents four additional grants to less than non officer  non director grantees 
the investigation team reviewed approximately of all options granted by finisar during the review period 
approximately million files of data were collected from electronic sources and screened using pre determined key word searches developed by the investigation team and reviewed by our independent auditors  and approximately  documents were then reviewed 
the investigation team gathered and reviewed metadata from certain documents  reviewed electronic and hard copy documents from our human resources files  computer hard drives from custodians  payroll and other human resources files and data storage systems  stock administration files  documents  including minutes of meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board  and other relevant documentation maintained by our finance or legal departments 
a total of interviews of persons were conducted by the investigation team 
these interviews included all present and former board members since the date of our initial public offering  all currently employed officers and one former officer who either received options or who were involved with the authorization of stock option grants or the administration of the stock option granting process during the review period  and all employees who were involved with the authorization of stock option grants or the administration of the stock option granting process during the review period 
representatives of our independent auditors and outside legal counsel were also interviewed 
at the conclusion of the investigation by the investigation team  a working group was formed to address the accounting implications of the results of the investigation by the investigation team 
the working group was composed of managers from our accounting and legal departments with assistance from independent third parties engaged to assist in the assessment of the historical accounting treatment of stock option grants  as tax advisors and in the calculation of the revised stock based compensation expense based on the revised measurement dates 
at no point during the review period were any of the members of the working group involved in the administration of our stock option granting process 
other than the chief financial officer  no members were involved in determining to whom options were granted  the number of shares comprising each grant  or the date of grant 
while our chief financial officer was involved in communications concerning several of the grants at issue which occurred during the review period  he did not approve any of those grants 
in addition to reviewing data provided by the investigation team  the working group performed additional procedures to facilitate its understanding of the documents  the underlying stock option grants  our historical stock option granting practices  and the accounting implications thereof  additional testing and analyses of our hiring  termination  leave of absence  and grant notification practices regarding stock options was performed 
the audit committee considered the scope of the investigation team s review to have been substantively and procedurally thorough 
the investigation team identified grant dates dates on which our records show a stock option grant had occurred during the review period 
of the grant dates  the investigation team reviewed grant dates of interest based on the size of the grant or some other factor 
these grant dates reviewed represented of all options granted during the review period 
the working group performed a subsequent review of of the option grants during the review period and identified separate stock option granting actions granting actions made on the original grant dates grant dates during the review period 
the investigation team noted that none of the past or present members of our board of directors  nor our chief executive  received any grants during the review period on a date for which the measurement date was ultimately revised  except in the case of one grant to two of our board members where the date of approval of the grant by the board of directors differed from the date on which the grant was recorded 
in that instance  the exercise price was higher on the date on which the grant was erroneously recorded than on the date the options were approved by the board of directors  and  as a result  we did not recognize any additional stock based compensation expense on this grant 
neither the board of directors nor company management placed any restrictions on the scope of the audit committee s review nor did the audit committee place any restrictions on the review conducted by the investigation team or the working group 
both the board of directors and company management cooperated fully with the audit committee and its advisors 

table of contents findings and remedial measures based on the results of the investigation by the audit committee  and additional work performed by the working group  we found evidence that we previously used incorrect measurement dates when accounting for stock option grants pursuant to apb and related interpretations 
we have concluded that revised measurement dates are required for  or  of the granting actions during the review period  and that it is necessary to modify the accounting measurement dates for approximately of the stock option grants awarded during the review period to employees and consultants 
this consists of options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
certain historic grants were also determined to be subject to variable accounting 
revising option grant measurement dates results in total additional stock based compensation expense of million to be recognized in the fiscal years through approximately of this total additional stock based compensation expense  or million  is attributable to six key granting actions that occurred between june and august  representing approximately million shares  or of all options granted during the review period 
three of these six key granting actions were performance grants  and three were new hire grants  as such grant types are discussed below 
in addition  we identified modifications to certain stock options related to extended leaves of absence that should have been accounted for by applying modification accounting as required by the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  or fin this resulted in approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense  of which million is attributable to one leave of absence 
therefore  as a result of the investigation  we have identified a total of million in additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense for the fiscal years through million prior to the consideration of payroll tax charges and inventory capitalization  and had approximately million of deferred stock based compensation expense to be amortized as of april  as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to consolidated financial statements  on may   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
as required by sfas r  the unamortized deferred compensation expense of million at may  has been reclassified to additional paid in capital 
these adjustments for stock based compensation  shown before any related payroll tax charges  inventory capitalization or income tax effects  are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  total stock based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates other leaves of absence total includes the acceleration of million in deferred stock based compensation expense related to our previous option exchange program 
see the section entitled option exchange program below for a further discussion of this program 
consistent with our historical accounting policy  we use the graded  or accelerated  amortization method to determine the amount of stock based compensation expense for each reporting period 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  we immediately expensed the unamortized deferred stock based compensation expense associated with options with revised measurement dates that were cancelled as part of our stock option exchange program in fiscal as a result  on the date of the cancellation  we recognized million of deferred stock based compensation 
see the discussion of the option exchange program below under option exchange program 
of the million total restated stock based compensation expense arising from the investigation  million  or  has been expensed by the end of our fiscal year ended on april  this is primarily attributable to i the fact that the intrinsic value of the revised option awards was greater in the early years 
table of contents of the review period  ii we used graded  or accelerated  amortization method to recognize stock based compensation and iii as a result of the deferred compensation expense recognized upon the cancellation of options as part of our stock option exchange program in fiscal only and  respectively  of the total restated stock based compensation expense impacted our and fiscal years  respectively 
during the course of the investigation  we reviewed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  using the criteria set forth in internal control integrated framework issued by coso 
based on this assessment  as a result of the conclusions reached in the investigation  we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our stock option granting practices and the related accounting  which we believe have been remediated by april  see our discussion in item a controls and procedures  below 
specifically  in the case of grants which were approved pursuant to the authority delegated to our chief executive officer as the stock plan committee  the audit committee found process related deficiencies 
these deficiencies resulted in the company erroneously treating the stated grant date as the measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
the grants in this category included performance grants  grants to newly hired employees and grants to employees hired in connection with acquisitions of other companies by finisar 
the audit committee concluded that twelve performance grants either lacked contemporaneous evidence to verify the date selected or  in the case of two grants  were selected retrospectively to capture a more favorable price 
the audit committee found that grants to newly hired employees lacked contemporaneous evidence of grant date selection 
additionally  the audit committee found that four grants to employees of acquired companies were recorded on a date other than that specified in the acquisition agreements 
in eight granting actions  a grant date was properly approved on a grant date that was prior to the recorded grant date  effectively repricing the grant  resulting in variable accounting 
finally  a grant to three of our officers  including a grant to our chief financial officer  was erroneously included in a large  broad based performance grant granting action by the stock plan committee 
the audit committee was unable to locate conclusive evidence that a grant to these officers was approved by the board of directors or compensation committee prior to the granting action by the stock plan committee 
nonetheless  the audit committee considers these grants to be valid obligations of the company 
the audit committee found no evidence of intentional misconduct or malfeasance on the part of company personnel involved in selecting and approving the grant dates or administering the stock option granting process 
additionally  the chief executive officer did not benefit from any of these grants 
in fiscal  prior to the commencement of and not in response to the internal review that led to the investigation by the audit committee  the audit committee recommended  and the board of directors adopted  new policies and procedures with regard to grants of equity compensation awards to board members  officers  and non officer employees alike 
under these policies and procedures all stock option grants and other equity awards to executive officers are to be granted by the compensation committee 
all other awards are generally to be granted by the compensation committee  although grants to non executive officers may be granted by the board 
except in special circumstances  all awards are to be granted at regular quarterly meetings of the compensation committee 
awards are to be approved at meetings of the compensation committee or the board of directors  and not by unanimous written consent 
the effective date of each award approved at a regular quarterly meeting will be the later of the third trading day following the public announcement of our financial results for the preceding quarter or the date of the meeting 
the key terms of each award are to be communicated to the recipient promptly following the award 
the remedial measures described above provide for training and education in those rules and the designation of a finance department employee to be responsible for the accounting for stock options and other forms of equity compensation 

table of contents management determined that the revised option granting procedures and controls that were implemented in august were effective in enabling us to appropriately determine measurement dates and properly account for stock option grants made subsequent to august in connection with the completion of its investigation  and in light of the findings from the investigation  the audit committee recommended that the board consider  and the board of directors unanimously adopted  certain remedial measures  including the following the implementation of a cross functional training program for certain key employees concerning i the company s equity compensation programs and related improvements in equity compensation controls  processes and procedures  ii the accounting implications of the company s equity compensation programs and iii the legal implications of the equity compensation programs 
the appointment of a designated finance department employee to be responsible for the accounting for stock options and other forms of equity compensation 
the adoption of additional policies to assure that grants will be recorded promptly in the company s option accounting database  and that grantees will receive prompt written notification of their grants 
the adoption of policies to assure that there will be a specific date to complete the generation of a list of recommended equity grant recipients and number of option shares prior to the submission of the recommendations to the compensation committee for approval 
implementation of a requirement that our internal audit department review our compliance with the controls and procedures regarding equity compensation at least annually and report the results of its review to the audit committee 
we believe that these changes  together with the new policies and procedures adopted before the commencement of the investigation  remediated the past material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our stock option granting practices and the related accounting and reduced to remote the likelihood that any incorrect measurement dates or any material error in accounting for stock option grants could have occurred during the fiscal year ended april  and not have been detected as part of our financial reporting close process 
as a result  we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of april  overview of our historical stock option granting practices during the period prior to and immediately after our initial public offering  the board of directors approved all stock option grants  either at duly convened meetings of the board of directors or pursuant to approval by written consent 
our practice has been to grant stock options  except where prohibited  to nearly all full time employees in connection with their joining us  as well as annual grants to most employees in connection with annual performance reviews performance grants 
to facilitate the granting of options to our rapidly growing workforce  in february  the board of directors established a stock plan committee composed solely of our chief executive officer  and delegated authority to the stock plan committee to grant options to newly hired and existing non officer employees subject to certain limitations and established parameters 
for example  the board of directors delegated authority to the stock plan committee to approve grants in amounts equal to or less than  shares per employee to persons who were not officers or directors 
the compensation committee was delegated the authority to approve grants to officers  and to employees in amounts that exceeded the authority of the stock plan committee  while the full board retained authority to approve grants to members of the board of directors and grants made in connection with the acquisition of or merger with other companies 
during the review period  our chief executive officer made recommendations to the board and the compensation committee regarding stock option grants to officers  and  in his role as sole member of the stock plan committee  approved all stock option grants to non officer employees  except for grants in excess of his granting authority 
grants made to our existing executive officers as defined by section b of the securities exchange act of  or section b officers  were generally approved by the compensation committee  and were either approved at and recorded in the minutes of a meeting of the compensation committee  or by written resolution 
table of contents approved by all of the members of the compensation committee and set forth in a unanimous written consent  or uwc  of the compensation committee signed by all members of the compensation committee 
during the review period  the board of directors had sole authority to grant stock options to employees as part of an acquisition or merger  and to approve options granted to members of the board of directors 
stock option grants approved by the board of directors were either approved at and recorded in minutes of meetings of the board of directors  or approved by written resolution set forth in a uwc signed by all members of the board of directors 
the board also sometimes approved grants to newly hired employees  officers  and other individuals 
since our initial public offering  we have  from time to time  consulted with outside legal counsel about the design and implementation of our stock option plans  the establishment of the stock plan committee to whom authority to make certain grants was delegated and about some individual grants 
outside counsel also typically drafted minutes of board of directors and compensation committee meetings where stock options were granted  as well as uwcs of the board and compensation committee to approve stock option grants 
outside counsel did not prepare or review documentation of actions by the stock plan committee 
the stock plan committee approved of the granting actions 
fifteen granting actions were approved by the compensation committee  of which were recorded in minutes of meetings of the compensation committee and four were approved by uwc 
the board directly approved stock options in granting actions  of which seven were approved by uwc and seven were recorded in minutes of meetings of the board of directors 
there were granting actions by the board relating to options assumed in connection with acquisitions of other companies by us  and five granting actions by the board related to options granted to employees of acquired companies 
details of restatement consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance provided in a letter provided by the sec s chief accountant to lawrence salva  chairman  committee on corporate reporting  financial executives international and sam ranzilla  chairman  center for public company audit firms  american institute of certified public accountants dated september   the working group organized the separate granting actions made on the original grant dates into categories based on the grant type and the process by which the grant was approved and finalized as follows number of granting percent of number of percent of grant type actions total option shares total acquisition related assumed options target employees total acquisition related director officer performance new hire promotion option exchange program total the working group reviewed evidence developed through the audit committee s investigation related to each grant  and  based upon the relevant facts and circumstances  applied the applicable accounting standards to determine  for every grant within each category  whether the measurement date required adjustment 
if the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required  resulting in additional non cash stock based compensation expense related to the intrinsic value  that is  the difference between the exercise price and the closing sales price of our common stock on the revised measurement date 

table of contents we have concluded that of the granting actions made on grant dates  granting actions on grant dates require revised measurement dates 
the remaining granting actions on grant dates require no change to the original grant date 
the following is a summary of the revised granting actions by type of grant number of number of percent of option shares revised total with revised stock based granting granting measurement percent of compensation grant type actions actions dates total grants expense in thousands acquisition related assumed options target employees total acquisition related director officer performance new hire promotion option exchange program total while one properly approved grant to two of our board members was not measured on the appropriate date  it did not result in any incremental stock based compensation expense 
the grants giving rise to the total million in additional non cash stock based compensation expense based on revised measurement dates are categorized and summarized as follows new hire and promotional grants during the review period  we granted options to purchase a total of million shares to newly hired employees 
during the review period  grants made to newly hired employees new hire grants generally were approved by the stock plan committee on a periodic basis 
while details of stock option grants were generally set forth in the offer letter to the prospective employee  the grant date was determined when the grant was approved by the stock plan committee after the date on which the employee commenced employment with us 
new hire grants were generally made to all new employees who had joined finisar since the last date on which the stock plan committee approved and awarded grants to newly hired employees 
additionally  new hire grants include grants made to a smaller number of existing employees who received promotions or some other employment adjustment since the last date on which the stock plan committee awarded and approved new hire grants 
the evidence available to support the original grant date for options granted to newly promoted or other existing employees generally differed from the evidence supporting the measurement date for new hire grants 
thus  we differentiated between awards made as a result of a promotion or adjustment and new hire grants 
this differentiation based on award type resulted in application of different measurement dates for grants originally made on an original grant date 
we also found that offer letters to our malaysia and shanghai employees did not always include all of the details of the option grant to be made to newly hired employees in such locations required to determine the proper measurement date  ie  the number of shares underlying each option to be granted to the newly hired employee once the option has been approved by the stock plan committee 
accordingly  for those grants we required additional supporting evidence to determine the appropriate measurement date 
none of the grant dates recorded for new hire grants preceded the commencement of employment of any newly hired employee 
however  in multiple instances  evidence suggested that new hire grants were approved by the stock plan committee at a later date than the stated grant date 
in some cases  the identity of all grantees as set forth in such granting action was not known or specified with finality until after the stated grant date 
moreover  our stock plan committee s process for finalizing and documenting these grants was often completed after the originally assigned grant date 
in some cases  no contemporaneous  direct evidence of the date of approval by the 
table of contents stock plan committee was located 
additionally  in several instances  the evidence showed that the stock plan committee retrospectively selected a grant date with a more favorable price 
based on all available facts and circumstances  we determined that the originally recorded measurement dates for the new hire grants made by our stock plan committee during the review period cannot be relied upon in isolation as the correct measurement dates 
new hire grants to non officer  non director employees that required board of directors or compensation committee approval because the size of the individual grant exceeded the authority delegated to the stock plan committee were typically approved by uwc of the board or compensation committee 
we were unable to locate documents demonstrating contemporaneous board of directors or compensation committee approval on the date designated in the uwc as the effective date of the grant 
in some cases  the uwc was prepared after the selected grant date 
additionally  in several instances  no direct evidence confirmed the date on which the uwc was executed by each board or compensation committee member 
apb defines the measurement date for determining stock based compensation expense as the first date on which both the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price  are known with finality 
in of the new hire granting actions  reliable objective evidence suggested a single specific date on which approval was reached on the final number of shares comprising each stock option  the identity of those individuals entitled to receive each stock option and the exercise price of the stock option 
such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data such as emails and files attached to emails or written agreements  including offer letters 
we utilized this evidence to revise measurement dates for new hire granting actions covering options to purchase million shares of common stock 
this resulted in incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis  amortized over the respective awards vesting terms 
in new hire granting actions  where no other reliable objective evidence points to a single specific date on which the number of shares  the identity of all individuals entitled to receive those shares and the price had become final  we have determined the date on which information concerning the grant was first entered into our options software accounting database to be the most reliable measurement date 
we use a commonly available third party accounting software program to monitor and administer our equity award programs and to track and account for our stock option grants 
for grants where reliable objective evidence was not recovered in the investigation to support a specific measurement date  the revised measurement date was based on the date these grants were recorded into our stock options software accounting database 
the date on which information concerning the option was entered into this option software database was utilized to revise measurement dates for new hire grants covering million shares of common stock 
this resulted in incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis  amortized over the respective awards vesting terms 
in six new hire granting actions  the evidence suggests that the stock plan committee selected an initial grant date  then subsequently chose a later grant date when the underlying stock price was lower than on the earlier grant date 
in those cases  the fair market value of our common stock on the initial measurement date was higher than the later selected date on which the option grant was recorded 
based on the evidence  we concluded that such grants should be deemed to have been repriced and subject to variable accounting from the date of repricing as required by the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  fin and the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
 issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 eitf 
after considering forfeitures  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for these options that are subject to variable accounting  covering million shares of common stock 
this has resulted in incremental stock based compensation of million on a pre tax basis  amortized over the respective awards vesting terms through april  under fas  and upon the adoption of fas r on may   these options are not treated as variable awards 
upon review of all such new hire grants  we have determined that the correct measurement date for financial accounting purposes was different than the stated grant date for new hire granting actions covering million shares  or of all new hire grants made during the review period 
for grants representing million shares  the market price of our common stock on the revised measurement date was higher than the option exercise price 
this resulted in our recording of approximately million in non cash stock based compensation expense 
table of contents relating to new hire grants representing of the total additional non cash based compensation expense recorded 
performance grants performance grants were broad based stock option grants that were usually linked to the annual employee performance appraisal process 
approval of these grants to non officer employees was generally delegated to our chief executive officer  as the sole member of the stock plan committee 
this delegated authority included determining the number of options to be granted to each individual employee 
during the annual review process  each employee was awarded a performance ranking 
this performance ranking then corresponded to a range of option awards  or at times during the review period a set schedule  that was pre determined by the chief executive officer 
the stock plan committee determined the number of shares underlying the stock options awarded to the employee based upon this range or schedule corresponding to the performance ranking achieved by the employee 
the stock plan committee selected the grant date  which in all cases appears to have been a date after the start of the performance appraisal process  but prior to the date when the identity of the grantees and number of options allocated to each grantee were known with finality 
we determined that for all performance grants  changes to the list of approved individual employee grants continued to be made after the stock plan committee approved the grant date 
in some cases  the list of employees included in a particular granting action was not prepared until after the stated grant date  and  in some cases  changes were made to the number of shares comprising individual awards and or the identity of the employee receiving an award  indicating the grant was not finalized at the stated grant date 
in eleven of the total performance grant granting actions  reliable objective evidence suggested a single specific date on which the stock plan committee had approved the final number of shares comprising each stock option  the identity of those individuals entitled to receive each stock option and the exercise price of the stock option 
in nine of these performance grant granting actions  for options covering million shares  we found that not all actions had been taken  ie  the final number of shares comprising each stock option and or the identity of those individuals entitled to receive each stock option  were completed as of the stated grant date  and the details of the grants changed after the stated grant date 
we revised the measurement date to correspond with the date on which evidence was located to indicate that approval of the details of each grant was final 
since the market price of our common stock on the revised measurement date was higher than the option exercise price for eight of the performance grant granting actions  covering million shares  we recorded additional stock based compensation expense of million 
in two performance grant granting actions  no reliable objective evidence points to a single specific date on which the number of shares comprising each stock option  the identity of all individuals entitled to receive each stock option and the exercise price had become final 
therefore  we have determined the date on which information concerning the grant was entered into our stock option database is the most reliable measurement date for calculating additional stock based compensation expense under apb the date on which information concerning the grant was entered into our stock option database was utilized as the measurement date for these performance grants covering million shares of common stock 
the market price of our common stock on the revised measurement date was higher than the option exercise price for one of these granting actions  and accordingly  we recorded incremental stock based compensation expense of million 
in one performance grant granting action  the evidence suggests that the stock plan committee selected a grant date  then subsequently chose a later grant date when the closing sales price of our common stock was lower than on the earlier date 
accordingly  the fair market value of our common stock on the initial measurement date was higher than the recorded option exercise price 
based on the evidence  we concluded that the grant  covering approximately million shares  should be deemed to have been repriced and subject to variable accounting  from the date of repricing as required by the provisions of fin and eitf after considering the movement in our stock prices and forfeitures  there was no incremental stock based compensation expense recognized on this award through april  under fas  and upon the adoption of fas r on may   these options are not treated as variable awards 

table of contents we also found one performance grant to an employee as part of an annual granting action that was added after the original grant date 
we deemed it necessary to determine whether such action suggested that the entire granting action was still subject to change and hence the requisite granting action had not been completed pursuant to the requirements of apb  or whether the change related solely to the one so called straggler  which would not affect the measurement date of all other awards made in that granting action 
we found reliable objective evidence that the straggler grant represented a separate granting action  predominantly based on the fact that this straggler was added to our stock option database nearly six weeks after all other grantees in the performance grant  and  as such  did not affect the finality of the previously completed granting action 
upon review of all such performance grants  we determined that the correct measurement date for financial accounting purposes was different than the stated grant date for performance grant granting actions  representing million shares  or of all performance grants made during the review period 
for grants representing million shares  the market price of our common stock on the revised measurement date was higher than the option exercise price 
as a result  we are recording a total of approximately million in additional non cash stock based compensation expense relating to this category representing of the total additional non cash based compensation expense recorded 
acquisition related awards we made multiple acquisitions of other companies during the review period 
these acquisitions sometimes resulted in option grants being awarded to employees of the acquired companies  in one of three forms existing options held by the acquired company employees to purchase stock of the acquired company  that were assumed by us and became options to acquire our common stock assumed options  option grants made to induce employees of the target company to join us  the details of which were set forth in the acquisition agreements between us and the acquired company  and option grants made to employees of the acquired company that followed the form of our new hire grants  and were made to provide an incentive to such employee sometime after the acquired company employee became our employee but which options were not required to be granted by the terms of the related acquisition agreements 
assumed options were assumed by us at a set  formula driven ratio  as set forth in the acquisition documents  and as approved by our board of directors and were recorded in our stock option database at this preset valuation 
we determined that for all assumed options  the fair value of these options was appropriately measured as required by eitf issue no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination and included in the purchase price  and the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of those options  as measured on the date the close of the business combination  was deducted from the purchase price and recognized as compensation expense 
options provided as inducements to employees of the acquired company to accept our offer of employment post acquisition target employees were set forth and approved by our board of directors as part of the acquisition documents  or sometimes in related employment agreements and in one case were approved by the compensation committee prior to the acquisition but with an effective date specified as the date the key individual became an employee of finisar 
if the details concerning these grants were described in the acquisition agreements or in the related employment agreements approved prior to the closing date of the acquisition  we determined that the appropriate measurement date was the closing date of the respective acquisition 
the evidence indicates that some of these option grants were originally recorded with a grant date that was different than the date specified in the respective acquisition agreements 
we found that three grants required revised measurement dates because they were recorded on a date other than the date specified by the acquisition agreements or related employment agreements 
the exercise price of the stock on two of these grants was lower on the recorded date than the fair market value of our common stock on the date specified in the particular acquisition agreement 
this resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately million representing of the total additional stock based compensation expense recorded 

table of contents we determined that one grant  representing an option to purchase  shares of our common stock  made to a target employee of an acquired company was effectively repriced 
this grant was originally approved by the compensation committee with a grant date corresponding to the date of commencement of employment  and then approved again with a lower exercise price at a later date  causing the recorded grant date as entered into our stock option database to differ from the date evidence shows approval was first given for the grant 
this repricing on a later grant date resulted in the application of variable accounting 
although there was no initial intrinsic value for this grant  the application of variable accounting resulted in a total of approximately  in additional non cash stock based compensation expense being recorded by us representing of the total additional non cash based compensation expense recorded 
all unexercised options in this award were cancelled in fiscal director grants during the review period  grants made to our directors were approved by the board of directors at and recorded in the minutes of the board of directors  except for one grant date  when the grant was approved by resolution set forth in a uwc signed by all of the members of the board of directors 
there were five grants to members of the board of directors  representing options to purchase  shares of our common stock  that were properly approved by the board of directors at meetings of the board 
none of these five grants required changes to the measurement date that resulted in the recordation of any additional stock based compensation expense 
of these five grants  one granting action  representing grants made to two of our board members  had a different grant date recorded in our stock option accounting database than the date on which the board approved the grant  however  because the exercise price of the options recorded in the stock option accounting database was higher than the price on the correct grant date  no additional compensation expense resulted from this error 
unlike those revised grants we concluded should be subject to variable accounting  there was no repricing action taken by the approver  in this instance the board of directors  and the mistake appears to have been a clerical error made when the grant documentation was finalized 
accordingly  we have corrected the clerical error and recorded the grant date as the date the board actually approved the grant  at the exercise price on the date of approval  and accordingly  no incremental stock based compensation expense is incurred 
for the one grant to directors that was approved by uwc of the board  although the uwc was deemed effective as of a date earlier than the date signed by the directors  the uwc was sent electronically to the directors on the effective date of the consent 
in addition  the evidence indicates that details of the grant  including identification of the grantee and the number of shares subject to each option grant  were orally approved by the members of the board on  or in advance of  the effective date of the uwc 
accordingly  we determined that the details of such grant had been agreed to by the members of the board of directors on or before the effective date of the grant  and the audit committee considered that the date of execution of the uwc did not change the grant date 
officer grants grants made to our section b officers during the review period were  except for one instance described below  either approved by the board of directors or the compensation committee  at a meeting of the board of directors or compensation committee held in person or by telephone  or approved by resolution set forth in a uwc signed by all of the members of the board of directors or compensation committee 
for all grants approved by uwc  the investigation team determined that evidence supported the effective date of the uwc as the appropriate grant date 
the evidence obtained in the course of the investigation indicates that details of the grant  including the identification of the grantee and number of shares subject to each individual grant  were orally approved by the members of the board of directors or compensation committee  as applicable  on  or in advance of  the effective date of the uwc 
some uwcs were deemed effective as of a date earlier than the date the uwc was sent to or signed by the directors  although generally such uwcs were sent electronically to the directors to sign either on the effective date of the consent or within one day after the consent  however  the directors did not always sign the consents on the effective date of the consent 
however  because the evidence shows that all such grants had been agreed to by all members of the board or compensation committee  as applicable  on or before the effective date of the grant  the audit committee considered that the date of execution of the uwc did not change the grant date 
fourteen grants to officers  representing options to purchase million shares of our common stock  were properly approved during the review period  and required no change to the grant date 
in one case  a grant to an 
table of contents officer was documented by uwc  but recorded in our stock option accounting database on a date other than the date the evidence indicates that final approval of the grant was made  resulting in the option having a lower exercise price than the fair market value of our common stock on the effective date 
unlike those revised grants we concluded should be subject to variable accounting  there was no repricing action taken by the approver  in this instance the compensation committee  and the mistake appears to have been a clerical error made when the grant documentation was finalized 
accordingly  we have corrected the clerical error made to the grant date as recorded in the stock option accounting database and the related grant documentation 
in one instance  a broad based annual performance grant of options to purchase a total of  shares made in june by the stock plan committee erroneously included grants of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares to three section b officers including our chief financial officer 
the audit committee has not located conclusive evidence that the three officer grants were separately approved by the board of directors or the compensation committee 
nonetheless  the audit committee considers these grants to be valid obligations of the company 
this grant was made shortly after the board of directors established the stock plan committee 
based on the evidence  initially there was some confusion about the limits of the chief executive officer s authority  acting as the stock plan committee  to make option grants  and the grantees had no reason to doubt his authority to make these grants 
the measurement date for these options was revised along with the grants to non officers in this performance granting action 
awards subject to variable accounting as noted above under the discussions of new hire  performance  and acquisition related awards  we concluded that certain revised option awards were repriced and thus subject to variable accounting 
to the extent these awards have intrinsic value on the original grant date  as determined in the investigation  the amount of this intrinsic value  net of any forfeitures  is the minimum fixed portion of stock based compensation expense to be recorded for these grants  regardless of the fact that the award becomes subject to variable accounting when repriced 
in addition to the fixed portion of the stock based compensation expense for awards and from the date of the repricing  the variable stock based compensation attributable to these awards is recomputed at each reporting date based on the difference between the option exercise price and the then market value of our common stock 
such variable accounting continues until the option is exercised  forfeited or otherwise cancelled 
these grants are not treated as variable under the disclosure only provisions of fas  or under fas r  which we adopted on may  under fas and fas r  the total stock based compensation expense for such repricings  which are considered modifications  is the sum of the original grant date fair value plus any incremental fair value of the option award as of the modification date 
the following table reflects the amount of additional stock based compensation expense included in the total additional stock based compensation expense of million recorded as a result of the investigation that relates to the options discussed above that we determined were subject to variable accounting in thousands fiscal year ended april  total fixed portion of variable stock based compensation related to initial intrinsic value variable stock based compensation total improperly recorded leaves of absences our stock option plans provide that vesting of options held by employees ceases during leaves of absence taken by the employee  and that the options held by such employees do not continue to vest during such leaves of absence 
during the review and testing of personnel files related to leave of absences  we found that leaves of absence taken by employees were not always recorded in our stock option accounting database 
thus  in some instances  vesting of the option continued to be recorded during the leave of absence  which resulted in accelerated vesting for certain stock option awards 
pursuant to fasb interpretation  such continuation and or subsequent acceleration of 
table of contents vesting constitutes a modification of the option grant that results in a new measurement date for such grant 
this modification results in additional stock based compensation expense  measured on the modification date  which is generally the date that the leave commenced  but only expensed to the extent that the employee actually received a benefit that such employee would not otherwise have received absent the modification 
we identified unrecorded leaves of absence 
in cases  the employee remained employed by us for a period of time beyond the vesting period of the option and for a period of time at least equal to the amount of the acceleration provided as a result of the leave of absence 
therefore  the employee received no additional benefit from accelerated vesting 
in instances  the employee terminated his or her employment with us 
in eleven of these instances we determined that the employee benefited from accelerated vesting or extended exercise periods and the related options had intrinsic value on the date of modification 
this resulted in million of additional stock based compensation expense 
one leave of absence  to a section b officer  accounted for million of that million additional expense 
other modifications we also reviewed other instances where modifications were made to employee stock options such as accelerations or extensions of vesting periods related to termination of employees 
we found instances of accelerated vesting or extended exercise periods which required the calculation of stock based compensation expense because the price per share of our common stock on the date of the modification was higher than the exercise price of the related options 
the amount of stock based compensation expense calculated for these modifications is  and had been previously recognized in the company s financial statements 
option exchange program on november   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for eligible option holders 
under the program  eligible holders of our options who elected to participate had the opportunity to tender for cancellation outstanding options in exchange for new options to be granted on a future date at least six months and one day after the date of cancellation 
in order to participate in the exchange program  however  the employee had to tender all options granted within six months of the commencement of the offer ie  all options granted after may  for cancellation and replacement with new stock options 
members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in the program 
the option exchange program terminated on december  and the shares were cancelled the next day 
as of that date  holders of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock tendered their shares for cancellation 
on june   new options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were granted 
under the applicable accounting guidance  all unamortized deferred stock based compensation expense related to cancelled options should be immediately expensed when the options are cancelled 
the working group verified that all options tendered in the exchange program were appropriately cancelled and replaced with new options that were granted six months and one day later 
the working group also determined that none of the revisions to measurement dates of stock options as a result of the investigation caused any other grant dates to fall within the period that was six months prior to or following the cancellation date of the option exchange program 
accordingly  none of the option grants made as part of the option exchange program are subject to variable accounting as a result of revisions to measurement dates 
of the options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock for which we have revised the measurement date  million options were cancelled as part of the option exchange program 
accordingly  of the million additional stock based compensation expense recorded as part of the restatement  million was expensed in connection with the option exchange program concurrent with the cancellation of such options 

table of contents summary of stock based compensation adjustments the impact on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing stock based compensation expense through april  resulting from the investigation is summarized as follows in millions restatement adjustments gross stock based net stock based compensation stock based payroll total income tax after tax compensation capitalized to compensation tax pre tax benefit non cash fiscal year ended charge inventory charge charge charges provision charge in thousands april  april  april  april  april  cumulative effect at april  april  april  total in addition to the million recognized through fiscal  million of unamortized deferred compensation remained as of april  as required by sfas r  which was adopted on may   the unamortized deferred compensation of million has been reclassified to additional paid in capital  along with the unamortized deferred compensation for stock options assumed from past acquisitions  in our consolidated balance sheet 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r on may   we recorded an additional million cumulative benefit from a change in accounting principle  net of tax  reflecting the net cumulative impact of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options as of may  that were previously not included in the determination of historic stock based compensation expense under apb in periods prior to may  impact of judgments and interpretations on restatement values we reviewed evidence gathered through the investigation by the investigation team  together with additional work performed by the working group 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  we applied the applicable accounting standards to determine whether the measurement date required adjustment 
for all grants  we considered the best available evidence to determine the most appropriate measurement date 
we reviewed the evidence available concerning each stock option grant and developed and documented a methodology  under the direction of the audit committee  to determine the most appropriate measurement date for financial accounting purposes for each previously granted stock option 
we then used the software tool in the program used for our stock option accounting database to compute the revised stock based compensation expense 
the strongest evidence of the appropriate measurement date available for each granting action ie when the essential actions necessary to grant the stock option were completed  including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee  the identity of the employee  and exercise price was used as the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares pursuant to apb and its related interpretations 
the specific circumstances surrounding each such grant were considered in determining the evidentiary level of support for a given grant measurement date 
we ranked the level of persuasiveness of each type of evidence 
written records  such as email messages  notes  spreadsheets and other information pertaining to specific grant dates  acquisition agreements and minutes of board and compensation committee meetings were deemed to be the most persuasive 
based on this evidence  we selected dates that represent the earliest information available whereby both the number of shares to which an individual employee is entitled as the option grant and the option or purchase price  if any  are known with 
table of contents finality 
evidence was also considered reliable when it provided compelling support for the specific measurement date 
evidence was considered inconclusive when it suggested the possibility of an alternative measurement date  or dates  or range of dates  but insufficient documentary evidence was available to identify a specific date on which the granting actions were complete 
we found objective reliable evidence on which to establish a measurement date for of the total option shares awarded during the review period 
these grants represent  or million  of the total non cash stock based compensation expense being recognized through april  as a result of the selection of revised measurement dates 
for the remaining grants  representing million of the total non cash stock based compensation expense being recognized through april   no contemporaneous documentary evidence was found to establish a new measurement date other than the date that the grant was entered into our stock option accounting database 
two granting actions  comprising million  represent of the total incremental stock based compensation expense attributable to grants for which we used the date that data was entered into our stock option accounting database to establish the revised measurement date 
where the evidence did not clearly support a specific measurement date  we selected the measurement date indicated by the best available evidence 
however  when one or more potential alternative measurement dates or a range of dates were identified  significant judgment was applied in selecting a specific measurement date 
in those cases  we also performed a sensitivity analysis to quantify the potential divergence in stock based compensation expense associated with the alternative dates or ranges for such awards 
in the sensitivity analysis  a date range was established indicating the earliest date on which the available evidence indicated that all essential actions necessary to grant the option could have been completed  including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee  the identity of the employee  and the exercise price 
the endpoint in the range was the last date on which all essential actions necessary to grant the option could have been completed  which was often the date the grant was first entered into our stock option accounting database 
an upper and lower stock based compensation expense was then computed based upon the highest and lowest closing price of our common stock during this date range  and the results were compared to the stock based compensation expense calculated using the date of grant selected by the working group for each granting action  based upon the best available evidence 
based on our sensitivity analysis for all granting actions in the review period  a review or assessment of the judgments and interpretations applied to the various grants resulted in a possible range of pre tax stock based compensation expense of million to million had we selected an alternative measurement date 
our final conclusion resulted in million in additional pre tax stock based compensation expense related to revised measurement dates 
the following table reflects the range of stock based compensation expense that would have been incurred at the high and low end of the sensitivity range  by grant type of granting low end high end grant type actions shares of range as restated of range in thousands acquisition related assumed options target employees total acquisition related director officer performance new hire promotion option exchange program total similar to the actual revised stock based compensation expense  had we applied an alternative judgment to select the appropriate measurement dates  approximately of the potentially higher or lower stock based compensation expense determined by this sensitivity analysis would have been fully expensed by the end of our fiscal this is primarily attributable to i the fact that the intrinsic value of the revised option awards was 
table of contents greater in the early years of the review period  ii we used graded  or accelerated  amortization method to recognize stock based compensation expense and iii as a result of the deferred compensation expense recognized upon the cancellation of options as part of our stock option exchange program in fiscal tax impact of restatement items in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements due to stock option adjustments  we recorded deferred tax benefits on the non cash stock based compensation expense over the option vesting periods for grants to individuals who were employed in tax jurisdictions where a tax deduction was available 
the tax impact of the restatement for stock based compensation expense reduced increased the tax provision for the fiscal years ended april       and by million  million  million     and  respectively 
as a result of the restated stock based compensation expense our deferred tax assets attributable to stock based compensation as of april  increased by million with a corresponding increase in our tax valuation allowance 
we have determined that in connection with the additional stock based compensation expense recorded as a result of the investigation  a related expense for payroll taxes should have been recorded 
we have recorded this payroll tax expense in the period of exercise of the related option as a result of our obligation to withhold taxes upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
our employer s liability for taxes is joint and several along with the employee 
as applicable  a portion of the liability has been subsequently released in the periods the respective statute of limitation lapsed 
we have recorded a charge to opening retained earnings for the fiscal year of  related to payroll taxes  an incremental payroll tax benefit of  in fiscal and a payroll tax expense of million in fiscal  resulting in a million payroll tax liability at april  an additional  was recognized in fiscal  resulting in a million payroll tax liability at april  internal revenue code section m limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of million that is not performance based and that is paid to the chief executive officer and the four other named executive officers in our annual proxy statement 
stock based compensation expense for non qualified stock options including incentive stock options deemed to be non qualified as a result of any re measurement was assumed to be deductible at the time of exercise  subject to limitations under section m and local country law 
based on our review of the option grants remeasured in connection with the investigation  no revised compensation expense  when considered in connection with any other non performance based compensation  exceeded the limits imposed by m 
because virtually all holders of options issued by us were neither involved in nor aware of our accounting treatment of stock options  we have taken and intend to take actions to address certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after december  may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under internal revenue code section a and  as applicable  similar penalty taxes under california and other state tax laws 
we presently estimate that we will incur a liability to option holders of approximately million  of which approximately million will be recognized as additional stock compensation expense in future periods  with the remainder being recorded in additional paid in capital as a cash settlement of a portion of the related option grants 
impact on sfas disclosure as a consequence of the stock option adjustments discussed above  the compensation expense that we disclosed in our footnotes under the fair value method has been restated 
we previously applied apb and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under sfas and its related interpretations through our fiscal year ended april  for sfas pro forma disclosure purposes  stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value method was adjusted to include the incremental expense resulting from the modifications to the measurement dates of affected options 
during the investigation we also identified and corrected errors in certain valuation assumptions used in the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our grants under sfas in fiscal years prior to as a result of the incremental stock compensation expense arising from the modifications to the measurement dates and the corrections in the pre black scholes valuation assumptions  our pro forma stock based compensation expense under the fair value method decreased

our optical subsystems consist primarily of transceivers which provide the fundamental optical electrical interface for connecting the equipment used in building these networks 
these products rely on the use of digital semiconductor lasers in conjunction with integrated circuit design and novel packaging technology to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable using a wide range of network protocols  transmission speeds and physical configurations over distances of meters to kilometers 
our line of optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors used in transceivers  primarily for lan and san applications 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and include internal manufacturing  assembly and test capability 
we sell our optical subsystem and component products to manufacturers of storage and networking equipment such as brocade  cisco systems  emc  emulex  hewlett packard company  huawei and qlogic 
we also provide network performance test and monitoring systems to original equipment manufacturers for testing and validating equipment designs and  to a lesser degree  to operators of networking and storage data centers for testing  monitoring and troubleshooting the performance of their installed systems 
we sell these products primarily to leading storage equipment manufacturers such as brocade  emc  emulex  hewlett packard company  ibm and qlogic 
since october  we have completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  
table of contents production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based upon each element s fair value as determined by the list price for such element 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  with the support of our manufacturers representatives  directly to domestic customers and indirectly through distribution channels to international customers 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale for our optical subsystems may span a year or more  while the sales cycle for our test and monitoring systems is usually considerably shorter 
the market for optical subsystems and components is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as industry over capacity  increased competition  the introduction of new products and the growth in unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although the timing and amount of these decreases cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
we have been manufacturing our optical subsystem products at our subsidiary in ipoh  malaysia  since fiscal we manufacture vcsels used in our lan san products at our facility in allen  texas 
we manufacture long wavelength fp and certain dfb lasers used in our man and telecom products at our facility in fremont  ca 
we manufacture certain passive components used in our man and telecom products at our facility in shanghai  china 
we conduct manufacturing engineering  supply chain management  quality assurance and documentation control at our facility in sunnyvale  california 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we undertook measures to reduce our operating costs in order to become profitable toward the end of fiscal  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to sustain profitability during periods of weak demand or when our product mix is unfavorable or when average selling prices are low 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families  and are generally higher on our network test and monitoring systems than on our optical subsystems and components 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan and san applications 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of overall revenue levels  shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  the cost of developing prototypes and fees paid to consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long term success 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to manufacturers representatives  salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and field support activities and other costs associated with the promotion of our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 

table of contents in connection with the grant of stock options to employees between august  and october   we recorded deferred stock compensation representing the difference between the deemed value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
in connection with the assumption of stock options previously granted to employees of companies we acquired  we recorded deferred compensation representing the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of closing of each acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested portion of options granted by those companies which we assumed 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholder s equity  with accelerated amortization recorded over the vesting period  which is typically three to five years 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense related to these grants steadily decreased over time and was fully amortized at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we commenced a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting  and recorded additional stock option related compensation expense for fiscal years ended april  through acquired in process research and development represents the amount of the purchase price in a business combination allocated to research and development projects underway at the acquired company that had not reached the technologically feasible stage as of the closing of the acquisition and for which we had no alternative future use 
a portion of the purchase price in a business combination is allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
prior to may   goodwill and purchased intangibles were amortized over their estimated useful lives 
subsequent to may   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but subject to annual impairment testing 
impairment charges consist of write downs to the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill arising from various business combinations to their implied fair value 
restructuring costs generally include termination costs for employees associated with a formal restructuring plan and the cost of facilities or other unusable assets abandoned or sold 
other acquisition costs primarily consist of incentive payments for employee retention included in certain of the purchase agreements of companies we acquired and costs incurred in connection with transactions that were not completed 
other income and expenses generally consist of bank fees  gains or losses as a result of the periodic sale of assets and other than temporary decline in the value of investments 
recent acquisitions acquisition of assets of data transit corp 
on august   we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of data transit corp 
in exchange for a cash payment of  and the issuance of a convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of million

the results of operations of kodeos beginning with the closing date of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of assets acquired were included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures require that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue and operating results  as well as on the value of certain assets  contingent assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of other significant accounting policies 
we believe there have been no material changes to out critical accounting policies during the fiscal year ended april  compared to prior 
table of contents years  except for the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
share based payments restatement of consolidated financial statements in calculating the amount of incremental share based compensation expense to record  we made certain interpretations and assumptions and drew certain conclusions from and regarding the independent investigation findings by the audit committee 
there is the risk that the interpretations and assumptions we made could be disputed by others after the fact or that we did not draw the correct conclusions from the findings 
there is a further risk that the investigation findings themselves were inaccurate or incomplete 
all of these risks are particularly acute as to grants for which there was inconclusive evidence to support the grant measurement date 
where we had incomplete documentation  we considered the guidance provided in a letter provided by the sec s chief accountant to lawrence salva  chairman  committee on corporate reporting  financial executives international and sam ranzilla  chairman  center for public company audit firms  american institute of certified public accountants dated september  specifically  we used all reasonably available relevant information to form reasonable conclusions as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred and the dates on which such actions occurred in determining the parameters of the restatement 
for grants with inconclusive evidence of a measurement date  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential accounting impact of alternative measurement dates 
the sensitivity analysis showed that a decision by us to select an alternative measurement date in some cases would have made the restated compensation expense higher and in some cases would have made the restated compensation expense lower 
this analysis resulted in a possible range of pre tax share based compensation cost of million to million  as compared with our final conclusion of million in additional pre tax expense for grants with revised measurement dates 
the possible range of pre tax share based compensation cost by year based on the sensitivity analysis is as follows sensitivity analysis low actual high fiscal year ended estimate adjustment estimate in thousands april  april  april  april  april  april  april  total adoption of fas r on may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
prior to that date  we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for share based compensation sfas 
in accordance with apb no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended april  includes i compensation expense for stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  may  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and ii compensation expense for the stock based awards granted subsequent to april  based on the grant date 
table of contents fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
compensation expense for all grants made prior to the adoption of sfas r that are expected to vest will continue to be recognized using the graded amortization attribution method  all grants subsequent to the adoption of sfas r will be recognized using the straight line attribution method  provided that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is no less than the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
in our stock based compensation expense required under apb and the pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
upon adoption of sfas r on may   we adjusted retained earnings by approximately million 
this adjustment reflects the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas r on retained earnings and represents our estimate of previously recognized stock based compensation expense that will be reversed when stock options granted prior to may  are forfeited 
the results for the prior periods have not been restated for the adoption of sfas r consistent with the provisions of the accounting standard 
as a result of adopting sfas r in the year ended april   our net loss in fiscal is million higher than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as we did in the comparable prior year period 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended april  was lower by than if we had not adopted sfas r 
we have not recognized  and do not expect to recognize in the near future  any tax benefit related to employee stock based compensation cost as a result of the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and our net operating loss carryforwards 
total compensation cost capitalized in inventory was  as of april  share based compensation cost of million and million was recognized in accordance with apb for the years ended april  and  respectively 
share based compensation recognized in the financial statements by line item caption is as follows dollars in thousands years ended april as restated as restated cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total share based compensation expense as of april  share based compensation cost capitalized in inventory in accordance with fas r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions noted in the table in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
for options granted prior to may   and valued on a pro forma basis in accordance with fas  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based solely on the historical volatility on our stock 
for options granted after april   and valued in accordance with fas r  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based on the historical volatility of our stock  we used the straight line method for expense attribution and we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rate in fiscal  based on our historical forfeiture experience  is approximately 

table of contents the black scholes merton option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our share based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
revenue recognition  warranty and sales returns our revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  the arrangement is divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
for units of accounting which include more than one deliverable  we generally recognize all revenue and cost of revenue for the unit of accounting over the period in which the last undelivered item is delivered 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
our standard warranty period usually extends months from the date of sale although it can extend for longer periods of three to five years for certain products sold to certain customers 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
we also provide an allowance for estimated customer returns  which is netted against revenue 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where  subsequent to delivery  we become aware of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for the doubtful account to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
a material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could result in a material reduction in the estimated amount of accounts receivable that can ultimately be collected and an increase in our general and administrative expenses for the shortfall 
slow moving and obsolete inventories we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically discard obsolete inventory 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the 
table of contents future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we use a month demand forecast  and in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future timing of product transitions  volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual timing  volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future  or additional usage of previously written off inventory in future periods for which we would benefit from a reduced cost of revenues in those future periods 
investment in equity securities for strategic reasons  we may make minority investments in private or public companies or extend loans or receive equity or debt from these companies for services rendered or assets sold 
our minority investments in private companies are primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
our investments in these companies are passive in nature in that we generally do not obtain representation on the boards of directors 
our investments have generally been part of a larger financing in which the terms were negotiated by other investors  typically venture capital investors 
these investments are generally made in exchange for preferred stock with a liquidation preference that helps protect the underlying value of our investment 
at the time we made our investments  in most cases the companies had not completed development of their products and we did not enter into any significant supply agreements with the companies in which we invested 
in determining if and when a decline in the market value of these investments below their carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings and cash flows  price multiples  prospects for liquidity and other key measures of performance 
our policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists  such as a the completion of a new equity financing that may indicate a new value for the investment  b the failure to complete a new equity financing arrangement after seeking to raise additional funds or c the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders 
as of april   the carrying value of these investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results at any of the companies in which we hold a minority position could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments 
restructuring accrual during the second quarter of fiscal  we consolidated our sunnyvale facilities into one building and permanently exited a portion of our scotts valley facility 
as a result of these activities  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these restructuring charges included  of miscellaneous costs required to effect the closures and approximately million of non cancelable facility lease payments 
of the million in restructuring charges  million related to our optical subsystems and components segment and million related to our network test and monitoring systems segment 
the facilities consolidation charges were calculated using estimates that were based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
as of april    of committed facilities payments remains accrued and are expected to be fully utilized by fiscal goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets our long lived assets include significant investments in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas business combinations and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas 
table of contents also included guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
we operate two reporting units  optical subsystems and components and network test and monitoring systems 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured in the second step 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and  we performed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that no impairment charge was required 
at april  our investment in goodwill and intangible assets was and million  respectively 
we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we write those assets down to their fair value which is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment of the businesses in which we operate 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that the remaining intangible assets related to certain purchased passive optical technology  acquired from new focus  inc in may  were obsolete  and had a fair value of zero 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded against the remaining net book value of these assets during that quarter 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that there had been an impairment in the value of intangible assets associated with certain products acquired in the acquisition of genoa corporation in april and in the acquisition of transwave fiber inc in may  and we recorded an impairment charge of  related to these assets

pending adoption of new accounting standards fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas replaces the different definitions of fair value in the accounting literature with a single definition 
it defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently in the process of 
table of contents determining the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
fair value option for financial assets and liabilities in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the provisions of fas become effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp 
fsp provides guidance in accounting for obligations associated with directive ec the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment adopted by the european union 
fas is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which we have significant operations 
the directive distinguishes between new and historical waste 
new waste relates to products put on the market after august  fsp directs commercial users to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and the related fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  for the measurement and recognition of the liability and asset retirement obligation associated with the historical waste management requirements of the directive 
additionally  fsp provides guidance for the accounting by producers for the financing of the obligations of historical waste held by private households 
we adopted fas in the first quarter of fiscal and concluded that no significant liability had been incurred as of april  we believe that the adoption of fsp will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accounting for income taxes in june  the fasb issued interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an enterprise s tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to uncertain income tax positions 
fin is effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  for all public companies 
accordingly  we were required to adopt fin as of may  the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we place our investments with high credit issuers in short term securities with maturities ranging from overnight up to months or have characteristics of such short term investments 
the average maturity of the portfolio will not exceed months 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership interest is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
for entities in which we hold greater than a ownership interest  or where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  we use the equity method 
we recorded losses of  in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  for investments accounted for under the equity method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly 
table of contents review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
there were no impairment losses on these assets during fiscal or we recognized impairment on these assets of million in fiscal if our investment in a privately held company becomes marketable equity securities upon the company s completion of an initial public offering or its acquisition by another company  our investment would be subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
the following table summarizes the expected maturity  average interest rate and fair market value of the available for sale debt securities held by us and related receivables and debt securities issued by us as of april  in thousands fiscal years ended april  fair and market thereafter total cost value assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate restricted securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate the following table summarizes the expected maturity  average interest rate and fair market value of the available for sale debt securities held by us and related receivables and debt securities issued by us as of april  in thousands fiscal years ended april  fair and market thereafter total cost value assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate restricted securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate we have subsidiaries located in china  malaysia  europe and singapore 
due to the relative volume of transactions through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
in july  china and malaysia changed the system by which the value of their currencies are determined 
both currencies moved from a fixed rate pegged to the us dollar to a managed float pegged to a basket of currencies 
we expect that this will have a minor negative impact on our future costs 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years
