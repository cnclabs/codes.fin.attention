we make loans that are subject to a well defined credit process that includes credit evaluation of borrowers  risk rating of credits  establishment of lending limits and application of lending procedures  including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances  as well as procedures for on going identification and management of credit deterioration 
we conduct regular portfolio reviews to identify potential under performing credits  estimate loss exposure  geographic and industry concentrations  and to ascertain compliance with our policies 
for significant problem loans  we review and evaluate the financial strengths of our borrower and the guarantor  the related collateral and the effects of economic conditions 
commercial and mortgage loan officers have no individual lending authority 
our loan committee of the board of directors is authorized to approve loans up to our banking subsidiary s legal lending limit  which approximates million as of december  we have established an in house limit of million  which is reviewed periodically by the board of directors  and do have loans to a limited number of customers in excess of that amount 
we generally do not make loans to be held in our loan portfolio outside our market area unless the borrower has an established relationship with us and conducts its principal business operations within our market area 
consequently  we and our borrowers are affected by the economic conditions prevailing in our market area

market we consider our core market area to be the communities within the baltimore washington corridor  including the eastern shore of maryland and particularly baltimore city and the counties of baltimore  anne arundel  harford  and howard 
lending activities are broader and include areas outside of our core market area such as other maryland counties  the district of columbia and certain markets in contiguous states 
our competition banking and consumer finance 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  competing for deposits and loans with commercial banks  thrifts  mortgage companies  finance companies  internet based financial companies and other financial entities 
our principal competitors include other community commercial banks and larger financial institutions with branches in our market area 
numerous mergers and consolidations involving banks in our market area have occurred in recent years  requiring us to compete with banks and finance companies with greater resources 
the primary factors we face in competing for deposits are interest rates  personalized service  the quality and range of financial services  convenience of office locations and office hours 
competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions  money market funds and other investment alternatives 
the primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates  loan origination fees  the quality and range of lending services  responsiveness  and personalized service 
competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks  savings associations  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies and other financial intermediaries 
many of the financial institutions operating in our market area offer certain services such as trust and international banking  which we do not offer  and have greater financial resources or have substantially higher lending limits 
to compete with other financial services providers  we principally rely upon local promotional activities  personal relationships established by our officers  directors and employees with our customers  and specialized services tailored to meet our customers needs 
in those instances where we are unable to accommodate a customer s needs  we will arrange for those services to be provided by other financial institutions with which we have a relationship 
current banking laws facilitate interstate branching and merger activity among banks 
this may result in an even greater degree of competition in the banking industry and we may be brought into competition with institutions with which we do not currently compete 
as a result  intense competition in our market area may be expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
mortgage banking 
our mortgage banking division also operates in an extremely competitive environment 
in addition to competing with mortgage banking divisions of other financial institutions  we compete with mortgage banking firms that are not under the same level of regulation as we are 
without similar regulatory constraints  these lesser regulated firms can be more responsive to customers 
additionally  competition in the mortgage banking industry comes from the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market  the proliferation of mortgage products  increasing interest rate volatility  compounded by homeowners increasing tendency to refinance their mortgages as the refinance process becomes more efficient and cost effective 
these swings in mortgage origination volume have placed significant operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders 
to compete effectively in this environment  we maintain a very high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise  consistently offer a wide selection of mortgage loans through all marketing channels on a regional scale  provide high quality service  and price our mortgage loans at competitive rates 
supervision and regulation first mariner and its subsidiaries are extensively regulated under federal and state law 
generally  these laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors and loan customers  not stockholders 
the following is a summary description of certain provisions of certain laws that affect the regulation of financial holding companies  finance companies  and banks 
the discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations 
changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of first mariner and its subsidiaries 
federal financial holding company regulation and structure 
first mariner is a financial holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended  and as such  it is subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve or frb 
first mariner is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the federal reserve and to provide the federal reserve with such additional information as the federal reserve may require 
the federal reserve may conduct examinations of first mariner and its subsidiaries 
with certain limited exceptions  first mariner is required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of any voting securities or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company  or before merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
in acting on applications for such approval  the federal reserve must consider various statutory factors  including among others  the effect of the proposed transaction on competition in the relevant geographical and product markets  each party s financial condition and management resources and record of performance under the cra 
additionally  with certain exceptions any person proposing to acquire control through direct or indirect ownership of or more of any voting securities of first mariner is required to give days written notice of the acquisition to the federal reserve  which may prohibit the transaction  and to publish notice to the public 
with prior approval of the federal reserve  first mariner may acquire more than of the assets or outstanding shares of a company engaging in nonbank activities determined by the federal reserve to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks 
under current federal reserve regulations  such permissible nonbank activities include mortgage banking  equipment leasing  securities brokerage and consumer and commercial finance company operations 
first mariner s subsidiary bank is subject to certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on extensions of credit to the financial holding company or its subsidiaries  investments in its securities  and the use of its securities as collateral for loans to any borrower 
these regulations and restrictions may limit the ability to obtain funds from first mariner s subsidiary bank for its cash needs including funds for the payment of dividends  interest and operating expenses 
further  a financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property  or furnishing of services 
for example  a bank may not generally require a customer to obtain other services from itself or its affiliates  and may not require that a customer promise not to obtain other services from a competitor as a condition to an extension of credit to the customer 
the federal reserve has ended the anti tying rules for financial holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries 
such rules were retained for banks 
under federal reserve policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank  and the federal reserve may charge the financial holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required 
a required capital injection may be called for at a time when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it 
in addition  depository institutions insured by the fdic can be held liable for any losses incurred by  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of  or assistance provided to  a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution 
accordingly  in the event that any insured subsidiary of first mariner causes a loss to the fdic  other insured subsidiaries could be required to compensate the fdic by reimbursing it for the estimated amount of such loss 
such cross guaranty liabilities generally are superior in priority to the obligations of the depository institution to its stockholders due solely to their status as stockholders and obligations to other affiliates 
we have agreed with the federal reserve bank of richmond frb richmond to submit plans to improve our operating performance  reduce parent company leverage  enhance our enterprise wide risk management and enhance the effectiveness of our internal audit program 
we have also agreed to give prior notice to the frb richmond of any potential transaction involving a significant capital expenditure 
management believes it has taken actions to address these issues and these agreements do not restrict or impede our ability to conduct normal business 
state bank holding company regulation 
as a maryland bank holding company  first mariner is subject to various restrictions on its activities as set forth in maryland law  in addition to those restrictions set forth in federal law 
under maryland law  a bank holding company that desires to acquire a bank or bank holding company that has its principal place of business in maryland must obtain approval from the maryland commissioner of financial regulation 
also  a bank holding company and its maryland chartered bank or trust company cannot directly or indirectly acquire banking or nonbanking subsidiaries or affiliates until the bank or trust company receives the approval of the maryland commissioner 
federal and state bank regulation 
first mariner s banking subsidiary is a maryland chartered trust company  with all the powers of a commercial bank regulated and examined by the maryland commissioner and the fdic 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over the institutions it regulates to prohibit or correct activities that violate law  regulation or written agreement with the fdic 
enforcement powers also regulate activities that are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver  the issuance of a cease and desist order  the termination of deposit insurance  the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution  its directors  officers  employees and institution affiliated parties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the removal of or restrictions on directors  officers  employees and institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or other court actions 
in its lending activities  the maximum legal rate of interest  fees  and charges that a financial institution may charge on a particular loan depends on a variety of factors such as the type of borrower  the purpose of the loan  the amount of the loan and the date the loan is made 
other laws tie the maximum amount that may be loaned to any one customer and the related interest to a financial institution s capital levels 
the bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal stockholders or any related interest of such persons which generally require that such credit extensions be made on substantially the same terms as are available to third persons dealing with the bank and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment 
the cra requires that  in connection with the examination of financial institutions within their jurisdictions  the fdic evaluate the record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods and families  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered by all regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
as of the date of its most recent examination report  the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  each federal banking agency is required to prescribe  by regulation  noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
the federal banking agencies  including the fdic  have adopted standards covering internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits 
fdicia also imposed new capital standards on insured depository institutions 
institutions that fail to meet those standards may be required by the agency to develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes the bank meets substantially all standards which have been adopted 
before establishing new branch offices  the bank must meet certain minimum capital stock and surplus requirements 
with each new branch located outside the municipal area of the bank s principal banking office  these minimal levels increase by  to  based on the population size of the municipal area in which the branch will be located 
prior to establishment of the branch  the bank must obtain commissioner and fdic approval 
if establishment of the branch involves the purchase of a bank building or furnishings  the total investment in bank buildings and furnishings cannot exceed  with certain exceptions  of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus 
financial services modernization 
effective in pertinent part on march   the federal gramm leach bliley act glba revises the federal bank holding company act of and repeals the affiliation provisions of the federal glass steagall act of  which  taken together  limited the securities  insurance  and other non banking activities of any company that controls an fdic insured financial institution 
under the glba  bank holding companies can elect  subject to certain qualifications  to become a financial holding company 
first mariner made an election to become a financial holding company in and  as such  first mariner may engage in activities that are in addition to the business of banking 
the glba provides that a financial holding company may engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance and securities sales and underwriting activities  real estate development  and  with certain exceptions  merchant banking activities  with new expedited notice procedures 
the glba also permits certain qualified national banks to form financial subsidiaries  which have broad authority to engage in all financial activities except insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  and merchant banking  and expands the potential activities of subsidiaries of state banks  subject to applicable state law 
the glba may increase the competition we encounter 
deposit insurance 
as an fdic member institution  deposits of the bank are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the deposit insurance fund dif  administered by the fdic 
the fdic is required to establish the semi annual assessments for dif insured depository institutions at a rate determined to be appropriate to maintain or increase the reserve ratio of the respective deposit insurance funds at or above of estimated insured deposits or at such higher percentage that the fdic determines to be justified for that year by circumstances raising significant risk of substantial future losses to the fund 
assessments are made on a risk based premium system with nine risk classifications based on certain capital and supervisory measures 
financial institutions with higher levels of capital and involving a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than financial institutions with lower levels of capital or involving a higher degree of supervisory concern 
on february   the federal deposit insurance reform act reform act of was signed into law 
the reform act increases the general limit on deposit insurance based on consumer price inflation  with the first increase taking effect on january   and additional adjustments made every five years thereafter 
in addition  the reform act gives the fdic the authority to manage its reserves more flexibly and over a longer time horizon by rescinding the automatic trigger of of estimated insured deposits 
limits on dividends and other payments 
first mariner s current ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiary 
both federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of the bank to pay dividends 
federal law prohibits the payment of a dividend by an insured depository institution like the bank if the depository institution is considered undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would make the institution undercapitalized 
see federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of below 
we do not anticipate that such provisions will be applied to the bank 
the federal reserve has issued a policy statement which provides that  as a general matter  insured banks and bank holding companies may pay dividends only out of prior operating earnings 
for a maryland chartered bank or trust company  dividends may be paid out of undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner  from surplus in excess of of required capital stock 
if however  the surplus of a maryland bank is less than of its required capital stock  cash dividends may not be paid in excess of of net earnings 
in addition to these specific restrictions  bank regulatory agencies also have the ability to prohibit proposed dividends by a financial institution which would otherwise be permitted under applicable regulations if the regulatory body determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve and fdic have adopted certain risk based capital guidelines to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and items  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratio is obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets  which include off balance sheet items  against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier  or core capital  includes common equity  perpetual preferred stock excluding auction rate issues  trust preferred securities limited to one third of other tier components  and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill and other intangibles  subject to certain exceptions 
tier  or supplementary capital  includes  among other things  limited life preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible securities and trust preferred securities above amounts not qualifying as tier capital  qualifying and subordinated debt  and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations and less required deductions 
the inclusion of elements of tier capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
banks and bank holding companies  subject to the risk based capital guidelines are required to maintain a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when particular circumstances warrant 
in addition to risk based capital  banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to quarterly average assets  referred to as the leverage capital ratio  of at least 
first mariner and the bank maintained capital ratios that exceeded these minimum standards 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the year ended december  for more detailed information concerning capital adequacy 
federal banking agencies have adopted regulations specifying that the agencies will include  in their evaluations of a bank s capital adequacy  an assessment of the bank s interest rate risk irr exposure 
the standards for measuring the adequacy and effectiveness of a banking organization s interest rate risk management includes a measurement of board of director and senior management oversight  and a determination of whether a banking organization s procedures for comprehensive risk management are appropriate to the circumstances of the specific banking organization 
the bank utilizes irr models that are used to measure and monitor irr 
additionally  the regulatory agencies have been assessing irr on an informal basis for several years 
failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions  including limitations on its ability to pay dividends  the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital and  in the case of depository institutions  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  as well as the measures described under federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of below  as applicable to undercapitalized institutions 
in addition  future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy 
such a change could affect the ability of the bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends to first mariner 
federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of in december  congress enacted fdicia  which substantially revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the federal deposit insurance act and made significant revisions to several other federal banking statutes 
fdicia provides for  among other things  i publicly available annual financial condition and management reports for financial institutions  including audits by independent accountants  ii the establishment of uniform accounting standards by federal banking agencies  iii the establishment of a prompt corrective action system of regulatory supervision and intervention  based on capitalization levels with more scrutiny and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital  iv additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and v restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits  except for institutions which significantly exceed minimum capital requirements 
fdicia also provides for increased funding of the fdic insurance funds and the implementation of risked based premiums 
a central feature of fdicia is the requirement that the federal banking agencies take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
pursuant to fdicia  the federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted regulations setting forth a five tiered system for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions that they supervise 
under these regulations  a depository institution is classified in one of the following capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
an institution may be deemed by the regulators to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if  among other things  it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to asset quality  management  earnings  or liquidity 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fees to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of other requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator  generally within days of the date such institution is determined to be critically undercapitalized 
fdicia provides the federal banking agencies with significantly expanded powers to take enforcement action against institutions that fail to comply with capital or other standards 
such action may include the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic or the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the institution 
fdicia also limits the circumstances under which the fdic is permitted to provide financial assistance to an insured institution before appointment of a conservator or receiver 
interstate banking legislation 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of riegle neal was enacted into law on september  riegle neal authorized federal banking agencies to approve interstate bank merger transactions even if such transactions are prohibited by the laws of a state 
an exception to such authorization arises if the home state of one of the banks that is a party to the merger transaction opted out of the merger provisions of riegle neal by adopting a law after the date of the enactment of the riegle neal and prior to june  these laws must apply equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibit merger transactions involving out of state banks 
riegle neal also permits interstate branch acquisitions if the laws of the state where the branch is located permits interstate branch acquisitions 
the interstate merger and branch acquisitions permitted by riegle neal are subject to nationwide and statewide insured deposit limitations as described in riegle neal 
riegle neal also authorizes the federal banking agencies to approve de novo interstate branching by national and state banks in states which specifically allow for such branching 
to our knowledge  only two states  texas and montana  have opted out of the riegle neal provisions relating to interstate mergers  acquisitions of branches and establishment of de novo branches 
we anticipate that riegle neal may increase competition within our market area  although we cannot predict the timing or the extent of such increased competition 
privacy legislation 
current federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public personal financial information about customers to non affiliated third parties 
under these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies that provide a description of the conditions under which they may disclose non public personal information to non affiliated third parties and affiliates 
institutions must also provide annual notices to current customers that provide a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated parties 
these policies affect how customer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to third parties 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of significantly increased the anti money laundering and financial transparency laws to require additional due diligence for financial institutions 
the law set standards for verifying customer information at account opening and maintenance of records  and created rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
the law requires financial businesses to report cash transactions in excess of  to the us treasury department  and also requires reporting of suspicious customer activities 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance  accounting obligations and corporate reporting for companies  such as the company  with equity or debt securities registered under the securities exchange act of in particular  the sarbanes oxley act established  among other things new requirements for audit committees  including independence  expertise  and responsibilities  additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company  new standards for auditors and regulation of audits  increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers  and new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws 
economic monetary policies and economic controls we are affected by monetary policies of regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve board  which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures 
among the techniques available to the federal reserve board are engaging in open market transactions in us government securities  changing the discount rate on bank borrowings  changing reserve requirements against bank deposits  prohibiting the payment of interest on demand deposits  and imposing conditions on time and savings deposits 
these techniques are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the effect of governmental policies on our earnings cannot be predicted 
however  our earnings will be impacted by movement in interest rates  as discussed in part ii item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a risk factors our future depends on the successful growth of the bank and finance maryland our primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as a financial holding company 
our future profitability will therefore depend on the success and growth of first mariner bank the bank and finance maryland  llc finance maryland 
our growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure 
the inability of the bank to expand its business without substantially increasing the number of branches  the inability of our mortgage division to grow its residential mortgage business without substantially increasing its number of offices  or the inability of finance maryland to grow its consumer portfolio without substantially increasing its number of offices may prevent us from realizing our growth objectives 
a significant amount of our business is concentrated in real estate lending  and most of this lending involves maryland real estate approximately of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and consumer real estate development and construction loans  which are secured by the real estate being developed in each case 
in addition to the risk that the market values of the real estate securing these loans may deteriorate  these loans are also subject to the development risks that the projects will not be completed in a timely manner  or according to original specifications 
real estate development and construction projects that are not completed in a timely manner  or according to original specifications  are generally less marketable than projects that are fully developed 
the loans underlying such projects may be subject to greater losses in the event that the real estate collateral becomes the source of repayment 
in addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case  the bank often secures its loans with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of the bank s loans have real estate as a primary  secondary or tertiary component of collateral 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower  and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values to satisfy the debt  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
we have a high percentage of commercial  commercial real estate  and real estate acquisition and development loans in relation to our total loans and total assets our loan portfolio contains a high percentage of commercial  commercial real estate  real estate acquisition and development loans in relation to our total loans and total assets 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal deposit insurance corporation  along with other federal banking regulators  issued final guidance on december  entitled  concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  directed at institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending portfolios 
these types of loans also typically are larger than residential real estate loans and other commercial loans 
because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses  or an increase in loan charge offs  which could have an adverse impact on financial results 
this recent guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
based on our commercial real estate concentration as of december   we may be subject to further supervisory analysis during future examinations 
although we continuously evaluate our concentration and risk management strategies  we cannot guarantee that any risk management practices we implement will be effective to prevent losses relating to our commercial real estate portfolio 
management cannot predict the extent to which this guidance will impact our operations or capital requirements 
mortgage banking activities generate a significant portion of our noninterest income a significant portion of our business involves making residential mortgage loans through our mortgage division  which accounted for approximately and of our noninterest income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
real estate loan origination activity  including refinancings  is generally greater during periods of low or declining interest rates and favorable economic conditions  which had been favorably affected by relatively lower market interest rates during the past three years 
however  we did experience a deterioration in market conditions during and continued adverse changes in market conditions could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
moreover  most of our residential mortgage loans are secured by maryland real estate  therefore  a deterioration in local economic conditions could also adversely impact our earnings and has done so in we experience interest rate risk on our loans held for sale portfolio we are exposed to interest rate risk in both our pipeline of mortgage originations loans that have yet to close with the borrower and in our warehouse loans those loans that have closed with the borrower but have yet to be funded by investors 
we now manage this interest rate risk primarily in two ways 
on the majority of the loans we originate  we enter into agreements to sell our loans through the use of best efforts forward delivery contracts 
under this type of agreement we commit to sell a loan at an agreed price to an investor at the point in time the borrower commits to an interest rate on the loan  with the intent that the buyer assumes the interest rate risk on the loan 
beginning in january  a portion of our mortgage loan pipeline and warehouse were hedged utilizing forward sales of mortgage backed securities and eurodollars for loans to be sold under mandatory delivery contracts on a pooled or bulk basis 
we expect that these derivative financial instruments forward sales of mortgage backed securities and eurodollars will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of the derivative loan commitments and our warehouse 
however  the process of selling loans on a bulk basis and use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and eurodollars to hedge interest rate risk associated with customer interest rate lock commitments involves greater risk than selling loans on an individual basis through best efforts forward delivery commitments 
hedging interest rate risk in bulk sales requires management to estimate the expected fallout rate lock commitments with customers that do not complete the loan process 
additionally  the fair value of the hedge may not correlate precisely with the change in fair value of the rate lock commitments with the customer due to changes in market conditions  such as demand for loan products  or prices paid for differing types of loan products 
variances from management s estimates for customer fallout or market changes making the forward sale of mortgage backed securities and or eurodollars non effective may result in higher volatility in our profits from selling mortgage loans originated for sale 
we have engaged an experienced third party to assist us in managing our activities in hedging and marketing our bulk sales delivery strategy 
we experience credit risk related to our residential mortgage production activities we also face credit risk related to our residential mortgage production activities 
credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us  including the risk that an investor will fail to honor its obligation under a best efforts forward delivery contract to purchase the loan from us 
we manage mortgage credit risk principally by selling substantially all of the mortgage loans that we produce  limiting credit recourse to the bank in those transactions  and by retaining high credit quality mortgages in our loan portfolio 
we also limit our risk of loss on mortgage loan sales by establishing limits on activity to any one investor and by entering into contractual relationships with only those financial institutions that are approved by our secondary marketing committee 
while the period of time between closing on a loan commitment with the borrower and funding by the investor ranges from between and days  the process of selling loans on a bulk basis may extend the period of time we hold the loan and exposes us to a greater risk of early delinquency or default 
we experience risk related to covenants in our loan sales agreements with investors our sales agreements with investors who buy our loans generally contain covenants which may require us to repurchase loans under certain provisions  including delinquencies  or return premiums paid by these investors should the loan be paid off early 
any loans we are required to repurchase may be considered impaired loans  with the potential for charge offs and or loss provision charges 
the addition of these repurchased loans to our portfolio could adversely affect our earnings and asset quality ratios 
there may be certain loans in our portfolio that were originated for sale  but for various reasons  are unable to be sold 
these loans are transferred to our loan portfolio at fair market value 
any deterioration in value of the loan during the period held in the portfolio would be charged as a valuation allowance and would reduce our earnings 
we may experience loan losses in excess of the allowance the risk of credit losses on loans varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and  in the case of a collateralized loan  the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical loss experience in the loan portfolios  the levels and trends in past due and nonaccrual loans  the status of nonaccrual loans and other loans identified as having the potential for further deterioration  credit risk and industry concentrations  trends in loan volume  the effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures or underwriting standards  and a continuing evaluation of the economic environment 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans when their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
if management s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses  or if regulatory authorities require the bank or finance maryland to increase the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process  our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of outstanding loans  net of unearned income 
at such date  we had nonaccruing loans totaling million 
management actively administers its nonaccruing loans in an effort to minimize credit losses 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to nonperforming or performing loans 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in net income and capital  and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we currently hold a significant level of bank owned life insurance we currently hold a significant level of bank owned life insurance on key employees and executives that have cash surrender values of million as of december  the eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of various insurance companies to pay benefits in the event of the death of an insured employee  or return the cash surrender value to us in the event of our need for liquidity 
we continuously monitor the financial strength of the various insurance companies with whom we carry policies 
however  there is no assurance that one or more of these companies will not experience a decline in financial strength which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return our cash surrender value 
additionally  should we need to liquidate these policies for liquidity needs  we would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value as well as penalties for early termination of the insurance contracts 
these events would have a negative impact on our earnings 
economic conditions and monetary policy our operating results will depend to a great extent upon the rate differentials between the yields earned on our loans  securities and other earning assets and the rates paid on our deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
these rate differentials are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities  in particular the federal reserve board 
the makeup of our loan and deposit portfolios  in particular  determines our sensitivity to these factors 
at december   we had a one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap of million 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
like other depository institutions  the company is affected by the monetary policies implemented by the federal reserve board and other federal entities 
a primary instrument of monetary policy employed by the federal reserve board is the restriction or expansion of the money supply through open market operations  including the purchase and sale of government securities and the adjustment of reserve requirements 
these actions may at times result in significant fluctuations in interest rates  which could have adverse effects on our operations 
in particular  our ability to make loans  attract deposits and realize gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans  as well as public demand for loans  could be adversely affected 
see item business economic monetary policies and economic controls 
our ability to pay cash dividends is limited holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to dividends if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose 
although the board of directors has declared cash dividends in the past  it has discontinued such payments to conserve cash and capital resources  and does not intend to declare cash dividends until current earnings are sufficient to generate adequate internal capital to support growth 
our current ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the bank 
federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of the bank to pay dividends 
additional restrictions are placed upon us by the policies of federal regulators  including the frb s november  policy statement  which provides that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of the past year s net income  and then only if their prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with their capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
our ability to pay dividends is further subject to our ability to make payments of interest under junior subordinated debentures due through held by our statutory trusts mariner capital trust ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  and viii the trusts 
these payments are necessary to fund the distributions that the trusts each must pay to holders of its trust preferred securities collectively  the mariner trust preferred securities 
if we are unable to make such payments  if we determine to defer such payments  or if we default under our other obligations in connection with the mariner trust preferred securities  we will not be permitted to pay dividends to holders of our common stock until such time as we recommence making payments or are not otherwise in default 
in general  future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors  including the future earnings  capital requirements  regulatory constraints  and our financial condition as well as that of the bank and finance maryland 
our management controls a significant percentage of our stock at december   our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately  shares of our common stock either directly or with options  or of our outstanding shares of common stock 
edwin f 
hale  sr  who is our chairman  chief executive officer  and largest stockholder  beneficially owns  shares of common stock with options  or of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  because of the large percentage of stock held by our directors and executive officers  these persons could influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
our stock is not heavily traded the average daily trading volume of our shares on the nasdaq national market for the previous three months was approximately  shares 
thus  our common stock is not heavily traded and can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market 
factors such as our financial results  the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  and various factors affecting the banking industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and market prices for the stock of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to their operating performance 
therefore  our stockholders may not be able to trade large blocks of shares at the volumes  prices  or times that they desire 
our stock is not insured investments in the shares of our common stock are not deposits and are not insured against loss by the government 
we operate in a competitive market we operate in a competitive environment  competing for deposits  loans and customers with commercial banks  thrifts  finance companies  and other financial entities 
competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions  money market  internet based deposit intermediaries  mutual funds  and other investment alternatives 
competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks  savings associations  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  and other financial intermediaries 
many of the financial intermediaries operating in our market area offer certain services  such as trust  investment  and international banking services  which we do not offer 
in addition  companies with a larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to regulatory restrictions  have larger lending limits  and are thereby able to serve the needs of larger customers 
finally  our continued growth and profitability will depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled managerial  marketing  and technical personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the banking industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
contracts with our officers may discourage a takeover or adversely affect our takeover value we have entered into change in control agreements with nine of our officers 
these agreements provide for a payment to each officer of a multiple ranging from to of his or her salary and bonus upon the occurrence of either a change in control that results in the loss of employment or a significant change in his or her employment 
thus  we may be required to make significant payments in the event that the rights under these agreements are triggered by a change in control 
as a result  these contracts may discourage a takeover  or adversely affect the consideration payable to stockholders in the event of a takeover 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage a corporate takeover our amended and restated articles of incorporation articles  and amended and restated bylaws bylaws  contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the board of directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the company 
these provisions provide for the classification of our board of directors into three classes  directors of each class serve for staggered three year periods 
the articles also provide for supermajority voting provisions for the approval of certain business combinations 
although these provisions do not preclude a takeover  they may have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt which would not be approved by our board of directors  but pursuant to which stockholders might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction might not have the opportunity to do so 
such provisions will also render the removal of our board of directors and of management more difficult and  therefore  may serve to perpetuate current management 
further  such provisions could potentially adversely affect the market price of the common stock
