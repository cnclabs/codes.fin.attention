also referred to as saia and the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
the company is a an asset based transportation company providing regional and interregional ltl services and selected national ltl  and guaranteed expedited service solutions to a broad base of customers across states 
our operating subsidiaries are saia motor freight line  llc saia motor freight  based in duluth  georgia and the 
table of contents connection company the connection based in sydney  ohio 
the company integrated the operations of the connection into saia motor freight in february our business is highly correlated to the general economy and  in particular  industrial production 
it also is impacted by a number of other factors as detailed in the forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this form k 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network  as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by revenue per hundredweight yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
the company measures yield both including and excluding fuel surcharge 
fuel surcharges have remained in effect in the ltl industry for several years and have become an increasingly significant component of revenue and pricing 
fuel surcharges are a more integral part of annual customer contract renewals  blurring the distinction between base price increases and recoveries under the fuel surcharge program 
the fuel surcharge program is intended to reduce the company s exposure to rising diesel prices and other costs affected by increased fuel prices  such as purchased transportation 
however  in recent years  given the significance of fuel surcharges  the negotiation of customer price increases has become commingled with fuel surcharges and fuel surcharges have more than offset higher diesel fuel costs 
we have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as a result of increased fuel prices 
however  the total impact of higher energy prices on other non fuel related expenses is difficult to determine 
a rapid and significant decline in diesel fuel prices would reduce the company s revenue and yield until we made the appropriate adjustments to our pricing strategy

projected capital expenditures for could exceed this level if saia is successful in executing on its geographic expansion objective 
the company has historically generated cash flows from operations that have funded its capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december   which funded the majority of the million of net capital expenditures for acquisition of property and equipment 
cash flows from operating activities in decreased million primarily as a result of decreased accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals

amount of commitment expiration by year thereafter total other commercial commitments available line of credit letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates saia makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of saia include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for only the policy year march through february  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than 
table of contents percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
in connection with its acquisition of clark bros 
in  the company allocated purchase price based on independent appraisals of intangible assets and real property and management s estimates of valuations of other tangible assets 
the company is still in the process of determining the final allocation of purchase price in connection with the acquisition of the connection in november annually  the company assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the company  fair value of the assets and liabilities of the company  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event remaining goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options and cash based awards 
the criteria for the cash based awards are total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over a three year performance period 
the company accrues for cash based award expenses based on performance criteria from the beginning of the performance period through the reporting date 
this results in the potential for significant adjustments from period to period that cannot be predicted 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r with option expense amortized over the three year vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value at the date the options are granted

r in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used
