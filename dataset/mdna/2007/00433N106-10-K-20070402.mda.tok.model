the current organization of our business divisions is a result of our january   merger with insurance capital management usa  inc icm 
other results of our merger with icm are we have access to additional distribution channels  including a large network of insurance agents that icm has recruited to sell its products  we gained expertise in taking advantage of electronic technology and web based services to shorten product development and implementation time  we are able to complement our non insurance medical discount programs with a broad range of health insurance and specialty insurance products  and we have reorganized our management team to include key members of the icm management team  including icm s founder  peter w

nauert  a former ceo of two public companies  brings us significant expertise and experience in the health insurance industry 
in order to more properly reflect our broadened mission of providing access to affordable healthcare for all americans  we changed our name from precis  inc to access plans usa  inc 
upon the completion of our merger with icm 
in  we did not have access to icm s products and distribution channels and operated three business segments 
the majority of our revenue was derived from our discount medical programs that continue as one of our primary business segments 
see note segmented information in the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
for the year ended december   of our consolidated revenue was from discount medical programs and was derived primarily from our third party administration services that adjudicate and pay medical claims for employers who maintain self funded or partially self funded healthcare programs 
we also operated a financial services division in  but results from that division were not material to our operations in our reportable business segments in will include those of icm 
through  the number of active members in our discount medical programs continued to decline  leading to decreased revenues from those operations 
we discuss these results in detail throughout this report 
we have taken significant cost cutting actions to offset the loss in this revenue and have taken other actions  including our merger 
table of contents with icm  to increase membership levels by developing additional distribution channels and by adding new products and services to the suite of programs we offer 
throughout  we have continued the measures and initiatives to improve our operating efficiencies and performance  especially through cost reductions 
these measures and initiatives include i discontinuance of certain non profitable operations  ii the conversion of certain of our customer service and system support functions from a fixed to a variable cost structure by outsourcing them  iii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  and iv personnel reductions and other cost reduction actions 
the discontinued operations had losses of  in the other initiatives resulted in restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of of  further  aai recorded a  impairment to goodwill including tax considerations of  that resulted from current and projected reductions in earnings primarily due to a decline in the number of lives covered under plans that it administered and capella recorded a  impairment to goodwill due to the continuing decline in members and revenue

nationally  healthcare expenditures topped trillion in  up from trillion in 
source centers for medicare and medicaid services 
costs of healthcare in doctors offices and hospitals for this patient population are often far higher than the amount an insured and the insurance company would pay for the same healthcare services for its insureds 
the growing number of uninsured people have special needs for accessing affordable health care 
the insured and underinsured 
in  of the us population participated in employer sponsored medical insurance plans  showing a steady year by year decrease from in

source employer health benefits summary of findings  published by the kaiser family foundation 
over utilization of the healthcare system is one of the factors behind these trends 
american citizens are utilizing healthcare services at an ever increasing rate 
behind this phenomenon is the fact that insurance plans and 
table of contents healthcare management organizations are structured to encourage usage 
small co payments  generally from or per office visit  encourage insured consumers to use the healthcare system more frequently because they do not perceive themselves ultimately as having to pay the full costs of the medical services received 
a number of insurers have pulled out of certain states  due to state regulations that no longer provide for a viable operating environment for many insurance companies 
as a result of these health coverage cancellations  those formerly insured individuals and families are required to pay more for their insurance coverage  cannot obtain any coverage because of pre existing conditions or simply remain uninsured for healthcare 
in addition  recently enacted federal legislation provides for tax favorable health savings accounts hsas 
individuals with high deductible health insurance coverage can deduct contributions to their hsa from their reported income for tax purposes 
in  the qualifying health insurance must have a deductible of at least  for individuals and  for families and the maximum amount that can be contributed is  for individuals and  for families 
amounts contributed to the hsas can be used for certain uninsured medical expenses  but generally cannot be used to pay for the health insurance premium 
individuals can establish hsas without regard to their income and amounts contributed to the hsas do not have to be used within a certain time period 
for the insured  these changes in employer sponsored coverage also provide an increasing market for specialty plans that supplement or fill deductible or other gaps in coverage for millions of americans 
self employed and small businesses 
according to the us census bureau  in  there were over million firms in the u

table of contents our solutions through our consumer plan division and our insurance marketing division  we provide programs that consumers use to save money on their healthcare costs 
our programs range from traditional discount medical programs that provide access to networks of providers that have agreed to provide our members with a reduced rate for services  to mini med programs that include some amount of defined benefit insurance  to major medical insurance with a variety of deductibles 
these programs are described in more detail in our discussion of our consumer plan division and our insurance marketing division  but here is a summary of the range of our programs access plans usa s complete spectrum of health care programs in addition  our insurance marketing division also distributes specialty insurance and benefit programs designed for the senior market age and over 
our regional health care division provides cost effective plan designs  claims management  cost containment  predictive modeling  wellness programs  and administrative and managed care services for organizations with self funded or partially self funded health care plans  including large public and private employers 
our benefit program management services successfully reduce costs and provide access to affordable health care by directing our clients to ppo providers and our own case management services 
together  these services allow employers and groups to provide substantive healthcare benefits at a fraction of the cost of traditional health insurance 
none of our products or services is materially affected by seasonal changes to our markets 
our consumer plan division our consumer healthcare savings membership programs are offered under the trade name of care entr e tm or through the trade name of our private label resellers 
we also have developed and are in the process of launching a 
table of contents new series of programs under the trade name of usa healthcare savings 
our healthcare savings programs are not managed care 
instead  they are based upon and emphasize the following factors responsibility for the use of healthcare must be put back in the hands of the patient 
insurance policies with low co pays and low deductibles have become very popular  however  these arrangements actually encourage over utilization resulting in increased healthcare costs  and healthcare must be affordable for the patient  while providing the medical providers with adequate payment on a timely basis for services provided 
for years  insurance companies have been successful by obtaining healthcare for their insureds at much lower prices than that obtainable by the self insured person 
these benefits were provided through the use of preferred provider organizations ppos  where steerage of patients was promised to doctors  hospitals and other providers in exchange for lower rates 
in our consumer healthcare savings programs  we have contracted with some of these same ppos to provide healthcare savings to our program members 
we allow the patient and the healthcare provider to decide treatment protocols with no interference from any third party 
we simply provide our members with access to healthcare providers in their geographical area that have agreed to provide their services for a discounted rate 
in most cases  the consumer pays  or makes arrangements to pay  the discounted rate directly to the provider at the point of service 
some medical providers chose to send the original full priced bill to us for repricing 
we reprice the bill to the discounted amount and then notify the provider and the member of the amount that should be paid 
the member then pays the repriced amount directly to the provider 
we are not involved in the making of payments to providers 
our programs routinely assist our members in saving an average of over  and often up to  on their medical costs 
in  we examined  repricing transactions recorded between september of and december of for the ten most commonly reported procedures  we found the following code avg

price reflects the retail rates providers charge the uninsured  avg 
reprice reflects the care entr e discount rate  and total savings reflects the savings by our care entr e tm members 
current procedural terminology cpt is a registered trademark of the american medical association 

table of contents savings from dentists  vision providers  chiropractors and other services that do not require the use of a medical ppo are more difficult to track because our members pay a discounted rate at the point of service that is usually determined by a fee schedule and does not require our participation to reprice 
nevertheless  our arrangements with provider networks require that our members save on their visits 
on average  we believe that our members save to on services from these other providers 
our membership program encompasses all aspects of healthcare  including physicians  hospitals  ancillary services  dentists  prescription drugs  vision care  hearing aids  chiropractic and alternative care  air ambulance  hour nurse hotline assistance  and long term care 
some aspects of our programs are not available in all states 
in most states  memberships in our care entr e tm programs range from to per month per family depending on the selected options  plus a one time enrollment fee of to 
our new usa healthcare savings programs range from to per month per family 
our third party marketing partners may sell our programs for other prices 
typically  these marketers charge from to per month per family 
personal medical accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented escrow account requirements in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry 
we called these accounts personal medical accounts pmas 
a great number of our members of our care entr e tm program were required to establish and maintain a pma to access and provide payment for hospital services 
our private label partners were not required to offer these accounts to their members 
with pmas  we were able to pre certify the members ability to pay based upon the available pma balances and to process the members payments directly to the medical providers 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued the pma program because i the program made our care entr e product more difficult to sell  ii the program was expensive to administer  and iii the pre certification process presented risks to us because we occasionally did not receive adequate information from providers to provide an accurate estimate of what the expected procedure would cost 
all pma money on deposit with us was returned to the depositors by or during the first quarter of technology and member services we have made substantial investments in our proprietary technology and management information systems 
these systems were designed in house and are used in most aspects of our business  including maintaining member eligibility and demographic information  maintaining representative information including genealogy reporting  paying commissions  maintaining a database of all providers and providing provider locator services  re pricing and payment of medical bills  drafting members accounts on a monthly basis  and tracking of cash receipts and revenues 
we have also established websites for our programs that provide information about the program  allow for provider searches and allow new members and representatives to enroll on line 
the websites also allow representatives  through a password protected area to access support and training files and to view their genealogy and commission information 
the websites are set up as self replicating websites to allow representatives a copy of the websites under a unique web address 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a one year agreement with lifeguard emergency travel  inc lifeguard 
under this agreement  lifeguard provides certain member support services  claims administration  and fulfillment services for our members 
however  we do remain responsible for providing these services to our members 
many of our own member services  claims administration and fulfillment personnel were hired or otherwise retained by lifeguard to provide continuity of services to us and our members 
we retained a senior team of operations staff with expertise in the functions provided by lifeguard to serve as secondary customer support for our members and to also act as a quality assurance function overseeing the services provided by lifeguard 
lifeguard s operations are on a separate floor  but within the same building as our corporate headquarters 
the 
table of contents agreement with lifeguard will renew for an additional one year terms unless either we or lifeguard with proper notice elects not to renew or extend the agreement 
lifeguard uses a combination of our proprietary technology and its own proprietary technology to provide services for our members 
sales and marketing channels our products for consumers are currently offered through three distribution channels network marketing 
our care entr e tm programs are distributed by independent commission based contractors referred to as independent marketing representatives imrs 
our new usa healthcare savings program also will be distributed through this channel 
our independent representatives become marketing representatives by paying an enrollment fee currently and signing a standard representative agreement  and an annual renewal fee currently 
independent marketing representatives of care entr e tm are not required to be licensed insurance agents 
independent marketing representatives are generally paid a commission on the membership fees of each member they enroll for the life of that member s enrollment with care entr e tm subject to the representatives continuing to meet certain commission qualifications 
independent marketing representatives may also receive commissions equal to the membership fees if three or more program members are enrolled in a month 
in the month of the membership sales  no override commissions are paid to the representative s upline 
independent marketing representatives may also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those representatives 
we pay a total of up to in override commissions up through seven levels of marketing representatives 
in addition  we have established bonus pools that allow independent marketing representatives who have achieved certain levels to receive additional commissions measured by our revenues attributable to the care entr e tm programs 
the total regular or ongoing commissions payout  including overrides based on monthly membership sales after the enrollment month and the amount contributed by us to the bonus pools  can be as high as of qualified membership sales

competition consumer plan division 
competition for program members within the healthcare savings industry has become more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of the products and services through other channels of distribution 
competition for new representatives is intense  as these individuals have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our principal competitors are ameriplan  full access medical  new benefits  inc  careington international  international association of businesses iab  and family care 
we also compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new representatives 
our other competitors include large retailers  financial institutions  insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks  and other organizations  which offer benefit programs to their customers 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
insurance marketing division 
we compete in the highly competitive individual health insurance industry 
the major medical products and services of the insurance companies that we offer compete with large national  regional and specialty health insurers  including assurant  and various blue cross blue shield companies 
furthermore  senior managed care  medicare products and medicare advantage medical savings accounts offered by our acp division compete with other national  regional and specialty insurers  including universal american financial corp  banker s life and casualty  united teachers associates insurance company  torchmark  pacificare  united healthcare  mutual of omaha  conseco  inc  blue cross organizations  us health  and medicare hmos

many of our competitors in the insurance marketing industry have substantially greater financial resources  broader product lines  or greater experience than we do 
we compete on the basis of price  reputation  diversity of 
table of contents product offerings and flexibility of coverage  ability to attract and retain agents  and the quality and level of services provided to the independent insurance agencies and their agents 
we face additional competition due to a trend among healthcare providers and insurance companies to combine and form networks in order to contract directly with small businesses and other prospective customers to provide healthcare services 
in addition  because the products and services that we offer are marketed through independent agents  most of which represent and offer insurance products of multiple insurance companies  we compete for the marketing focus of each independent agent 
regional healthcare division 
aai operates in the el paso metropolitan market and competes against regional and national health benefit plans such as blue cross blue shield  united healthcare  cigna and aetna

we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industries  some of which are not within our control  include the ability to maintain contracts with reputable preferred provider organization networks that offer substantial healthcare savings  the ability to maintain contracts with reputable insurance companies and insurance agents and agencies  the ability to attract and retain independent marketing representatives for our consumer plan division  the ability to identify  develop and offer unique membership healthcare programs  the quality and breadth of the healthcare membership programs offered  the quality and extent of customer service  the ability to offer substantial savings on major medical costs such as hospital and surgical costs  the ability to combine the programs with affordable insurance plans that have high deductibles or set payment for hospitalization  prices of products and service offered  marketing expertise  compensation plans for representatives  the ability to hire and retain employees  the development by others of member programs that are competitive with our programs  responsiveness to customer needs  the ability to satisfy investigations on the part of state attorneys general  insurance commissioners and other regulatory bodies  the ability to finance promotions for the recruiting of members and representatives  and the ability to effectively market the product on the internet 
competitive risk 
while we believe that we are a leader in the industry  there is no assurance that competitors will not develop their own software that re prices medical bills or a full service customer service function similar to ours  our competitors will not increase their emphasis on programs similar to our programs to more effectively compete with us  our competitors will not recruit our independent marketing representatives and insurance agents by offering more attractive sales commissions  our competitors will not provide programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership fees or lower insurance premiums  
table of contents our competitors will not adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements  new competitors will not enter the market  other businesses such as insurance companies or preferred provider organization networks will not themselves introduce competing programs  and competitors may not develop more effective marketing campaigns that more effectively utilize direct mail and television advertising 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business objectives and plans our objective is to sustain and expand our leadership position as a provider of unique healthcare membership service programs and consumer driven healthcare solutions and as a distributor of health insurance plans 
key elements of our business plan are as follows continue to develop a broad spectrum of unique healthcare service programs for broad markets

by varying the features  including discounts medical  consumer and business services  defined benefit insurance and fully insured health plans  we are able to meet the product and pricing needs of a broad market 
we anticipate that this will allow us to capture a larger share of the healthcare market through existing marketing channels and through establishment of new client relationships 
continue to develop a recurring revenue base 
for our consumer plan division  growth in recurring revenue from the care entr e tm product is dependent on our independent marketing representatives continuing to market the care entr e tm program memberships and new usa healthcare savings memberships and to recruit new downline independent marketing representatives 
we intend to continually increase our support for representatives to maximize the volume generated through this sales channel 
recurring revenue from wholesale and private label clients is dependent upon the client continuously marketing our products to their customer base 
we intend to continue to focus our efforts on retaining our existing clients and obtaining new wholesale and private label clients through our direct sales team 
in our insurance marketing division  we intend to continue to expand our independent agent sales force  our specialty product lines  our insurance carrier companies we represent and the geographic jurisdictions in which we distribute products 
in our regional health care division  we intend to increase the revenue base of our third party administration services by expanding the service area of aai beyond the metropolitan area of el paso  texas 
leverage and develop multiple network partners 
while we currently have a contractual relationship with a well recognized and fully developed preferred provider organization network for access to savings on doctors  hospitals  and ancillary healthcare services  we need to continuously assess the capabilities of that network and work towards providing alternative network solutions for our members 
provide high quality consumer service for our healthcare membership program 
in order to achieve our anticipated growth and to ensure client  member and marketing representative loyalty  we continue to develop and invest significantly in our member service systems 
we have developed a proprietary computer database system that provides our customer service representatives with immediate access to provider demographic data  re pricing information and member information  including the components of each member program or plan and the details a member requires to properly utilize the program 
in addition  we have partnered with a third party that has significant experience in providing member services and administrative services for healthcare savings programs like ours 
provide high quality service for our sales representatives and insurance agents 
in order to achieve our objectives of increased memberships and product sales  we concentrate on providing quality service for our sales representatives in the field 
this includes ready telephone access to support personnel as well as access to websites  
table of contents conference calls and web conferencing platforms 
we enhance the value of our programs to these representatives by providing access to information and support on an ongoing basis 
continue to develop and enhance our technology 
we have incorporated numerous uses for internet and information technology in our marketing and service functions 
we plan to continue to enhance these operations to streamline and increase the efficiency of methods for our sales representatives and agents to enroll in our programs  submit applications and track their business 
increase tele sales operations 
we have initiated a number of affiliations with tele sales centers and organizations that utilize tele sales functions 
we intend to continue pursuing these channels to broaden the distribution of our products and programs 
develop private label product offerings 
we have implemented a number of private label product offerings for specific markets and entities 
we plan to leverage off our current administrative and product development systems to continue to provide private label availability to organizations that can commit to significant levels of sales of these products 
distribution of our products in multiple languages 
certain of our products are now available in spanish  including access to customer service assistance 
we plan to expand spanish language usage among other products and implement additional languages for targeted markets where we believe there will be a significant volume of prospects 
continue to expand our third party administrator services 
in response to the needs of our group customers  we have expanded our third party administrator tpa services 
our acquisition of aai in allows us to offer a full service tpa function that includes full plan administration  claims adjudication and claims management services 
governmental regulation we are subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints hereinafter regulations 
possible insurance company regulation 
our discount medical plans are not insurance and they do not subject us to regulation as an insurance company or a seller of insurance 
however  regulations in certain states currently regulate or restrict the offering of our programs 
occasionally  we receive inquiries from insurance commissioners in various states that require us to supply information about our discount healthcare programs  representatives  etc 
to the insurance commissioner or other state regulatory agency 
to date  these agencies have concurred with our view that our discount healthcare programs are not a form of insurance 
there is no assurance that this situation will not change in the future  and an insurance commissioner will successfully challenge our ability to offer our programs without compliance with state insurance regulation 
state discount medical program regulation 
over the last few years  over twenty states have enacted legislation that specifically addresses the operation and marketing of discount medical programs like ours 
the laws vary in scope 
some apply to discounts on all health care purchases 
some regulate only prescription discounts 
some exclude prescription discounts but regulate other services 
the laws also vary in operation 
some contain only provisions that relate to the operation and marketing of discount medical plans and some require licensing and registration 
because this legislation or regulations are newly enacted or adopted  we do not know the scope and full effect on our operations  and there is a risk that compliance with such legislation and or regulations could have material adverse affects on our operations and financial condition 
there is also the risk that a state will adopt regulations or enact legislation restricting or prohibiting the sale of our medical discount programs in the state 
in addition  california views our discount medical plans as managed care and its department of managed health care has taken the position that we must seek and eventually obtain a license under the knox keene act 
compliance with these regulations on a state by state basis has been expensive and cumbersome 
compliance with federal and state regulations is generally our responsibility 
the medical discount plan industry is especially susceptible to charges by the media of regulatory noncompliance and unfair dealing 
as is 
table of contents often the case  the media may publicize perceived non compliance with consumer protection regulations and violations of notions of fair dealing with consumers 
our failure to comply with current  as well as newly enacted or adopted  federal and state regulations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations in addition to the following non compliance may cause us to become the subject of a variety of enforcement or private actions compliance with changes in applicable regulations could materially increase the associated operating costs  non compliance with any rules and regulations enforced by a federal or state consumer protection authority may subject us or our management personnel to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution  and non compliance or alleged non compliance may result in negative publicity potentially damaging our reputation  network relationships  client relationships and the relationship with program members  representatives and consumers in general 
insurance regulations 
government regulation of health and life insurance  annuities and healthcare coverage and health plans is a changing area of law and varies from state to state 
although we are not an insurance company  the insurance companies from which we obtain our products and financial services are subject to various federal and state regulations applicable to their operations 
these insurance companies must comply with constantly evolving regulations and make changes occasionally to services  products  structure or operations in accordance with the requirements of those regulations 
similar to the insurance companies providing products and services offered by us  we are unable to accurately predict additional government regulations that may be enacted in the future affecting the insurance industry and the offered products and service or how existing or future regulations might be interpreted 
additional governmental regulation or future interpretation of existing regulations may increase the cost of compliance or materially affect the insurance products and services offered by us through independent insurance agencies and their agents and our operations  products or profitability 
we must rely on the insurance companies that provide the insurance products and financial services offered by insuraco to carefully monitor state and federal legislative and regulatory activity as it affects their insurance products and services 
the company believes that the insurance products and financial services that we offer comply in all material respects with all applicable federal and state regulations 
we work closely with independent associations that provide discounts and other benefits to groups of consumers 
among the benefits afforded to the members of such associations are varying forms of insurance 
our ability to offer insurance products that we are authorized to distribute to these associations for inclusion in their benefit packages may be affected by governmental regulation or future interpretation of existing regulations that may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or affect the nature and scope of products that we may make available to such associations 
product claims and advertising 
the federal trade commission and certain states regulate advertising  product claims  and other consumer matters  including advertising of our products 
all advertising  promotional and solicitation materials used by marketing representatives require our approval prior to use 
the federal trade commission may institute enforcement actions against companies for false and misleading advertising of consumer products 
in addition  the federal trade commission has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials  including those used by us and our marketing representatives 
we have not been the target of federal trade commission enforcement action 
there is no assurance that the federal trade commission will not question our advertising or other operations in the future  
table of contents a state will not interpret product claims presumptively valid under federal law as illegal under that state s regulations  or future federal trade commission regulations or decisions will not restrict the permissible scope of such claims 
we are also subject to the risk of claims by marketing representatives and their customers who may file actions on their own behalf  as a class or otherwise  and may file complaints with the federal trade commission or state or local consumer affairs offices 
these agencies may take action on their own initiatives against us for alleged advertising or product claim violations  or on a referral from independent marketing representatives  customers or others 
remedies sought in these actions may include consent decrees and the refund of amounts paid by the complaining independent marketing representatives or consumer  refunds to an entire class of independent marketing representatives or customers  client refunds  or other damages  as well as changes in our method of doing business 
a complaint based on the practice of one marketing representative  whether or not we authorized the practice  could result in an order affecting some or all of our marketing representatives in a particular state 
also  an order in one state could influence courts or government agencies in other states considering similar matters 
proceedings resulting from these complaints could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments and could have a material adverse effect on us 
network marketing organization 
our network marketing system is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that advancement  within a network marketing organization  is based on sales of the organization s products rather than investment in the organization or other non sales related criteria 
for instance  in certain markets there are limits on the extent that marketing representatives may earn royalties on sales generated by marketing representatives that were not directly sponsored by the marketing representative 
our network marketing organization and activities are subject to scrutiny by various state and federal governmental regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with various types of laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
the compensation structure of these selling organizations is very complex  and compliance with all of the applicable laws is uncertain in light of evolving interpretation of existing laws and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining to this type of product distribution 
as of the date of this report  we are not aware of any legal actions pending or threatened by any governmental authority against us regarding the legality of our network marketing operations 
as of december   we had marketing representatives in states and the district of columbia 
we review the requirements of various states  as well as seek legal advice  regarding the structure and operation of our network marketing to ensure that it complies with all of the applicable laws and regulations pertaining to network sales organizations 
based on these efforts and the experience of our management  we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements 
we have not obtained no action letters or advance rulings from any federal or state security regulator or other governmental agency concerning the legality of our network operations  nor are we relying on a formal opinion of counsel to that effect 
we accordingly are subject to the risk that one or more of our network marketing organizations could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on us in a particular market or in general 
we are subject to the risk of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization  including claims by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
most likely these claims would be based on the network marketing organization allegedly being operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws  and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
in the event of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization by distributors  we would be required to demonstrate that our network marketing organization complies with applicable regulatory laws 
a final ruling against us could result in a material liability 
moreover  even if we were successful in defending against these challenges  the costs of such defense  both in dollars spent and in management time  could be material and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the negative publicity of these challenges could adversely affect our revenues and ability to attract and retain marketing representatives 

table of contents healthcare regulation and reform 
government regulation and reform of the healthcare industry may also affect the manner in which insuraco conducts its business in the future 
there continues to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation s health care system 
the gramm leach bliley act mandated restrictions on the disclosure and safeguarding of our insureds financial information 
the usa patriot act placed new federal compliance requirements relating to anti money laundering  customer identification and information sharing 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small employer groups and limits exclusions on pre existing conditions 
hipaa has also mandated the adoption of extensive standards for the use and disclosure of health information 
hipaa also mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and the efficiency of the healthcare industry 
hipaa s security standards became effective april  and further mandated that specific requirements be met relating to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of electronic health information and protecting it from anticipated hazards or uses and disclosures that are not permitted 
our re pricing software systems are considered hipaa compliant 
we previously engaged a consulting firm to assist us in our efforts to continuously comply with all other hipaa regulations 
we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations 
we plan to continually audit our compliance  and accordingly cannot give assurance that our costs of continuing to comply with hipaa will not be material to us 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal penalties and civil sanctions 
in addition to federal regulation and reform  many states have enacted  or are considering  various healthcare reform statutes 
these reforms relate to  among other things  managed care practices  prompt pay payment practices  health insurer liability and mandated benefits 
most states have also enacted patient confidentiality laws that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information 
as with all areas of legislation  the federal regulations establish minimum standards and preempt conflicting state laws that are less restrictive but will allow state laws that are more restrictive 
the company expects that this trend of increased legislation will continue 
we are unable to predict what state reforms will be enacted or how they would affect our business 
e commerce regulation 
the company may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with our product strategy  which includes internet services and products 
on an increasingly frequent basis  federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to internet based commerce and communications 
areas being affected by this regulation include user privacy  pricing  content  taxation  copyright protection  distribution and quality of products  and services 
to the extent that our products and services would be subject to these laws and regulations  the sale of our products and our business could be harmed 
legislative developments 
numerous proposals to reform the current healthcare system have been introduced in the us congress and in various state legislatures 
proposals have included  among other things  modifications to the existing employer based insurance system  a quasi regulated system of managed competition among health insurers  and a single payer  public program 
changes in health care policy could significantly affect our business 
legislation has been introduced from time to time in the us congress that could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in regulating insurance companies 
the company is unable to evaluate new legislation that may be proposed and when or whether any legislation will be enacted and implemented 
however  many of the proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  while others  if adopted  could potentially benefit the company s business 

table of contents employees as of december   we had full time employees in the following departments number of department employees customer services and claims administration executive and administration information services provider relations finance and accounting sales and marketing data entry quality assurance utilization review and management the total number of our employees after we completed the merger with icm in january increased to our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel in all areas of our operations 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we provide no assurance that we can retain key managerial and technical employees  or that we can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages  and consider our employee relations to be good 
item a 
risk factors our risk factors the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report should be considered when evaluating our business operations and strategies 
additionally  there may be risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial  which may become material factors affecting our operations and business success 
many of the factors are not within our control 
we provide no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect the market price of our common stock  adversely affect our future operations  adversely affect our business  adversely affect our financial condition  adversely affect our results of operations  require significant reduction or discontinuance of our operations  require us to seek a merger partner  or require us to sell additional stock on terms that are highly dilutive to our shareholders

during  and we have incurred losses from operations in the consumer plan division and regional healthcare division and these losses may continue 
during  and we incurred losses from continuing operations of   and  respectively and net losses of   and  respectively 
as part of those operating losses and net losses  we incurred goodwill impairment charges of  including tax considerations of   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of  including tax considerations of  for aai and  for capella  respectively 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  related to capella 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  related to foresight  inc foresight 
before the goodwill impairment charges  income from continuing operations was  in and  in and a loss of  in the operating loss before goodwill impairment charges in was primarily attributable to the continuing costs associated with our care entr e tm medical savings program 
there is no assurance that losses from our care entr e tm medical savings program will not continue or that our other operations will become or continue to be profitable in or thereafter 
our revenues in the consumer plan division are largely dependent on the independent marketing representatives  whose reduced sales efforts or termination may result in significant loss of revenues 
our success and growth depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate the network of independent marketing representatives who principally market our care entr e tm medical savings program and the usa healthcare savings products that we are introducing in our independent marketing representatives typically offer and sell the care entr e tm program on a part time basis  and may engage in other business activities 
these marketing representatives may give higher priority to other products or services  reducing their efforts devoted to marketing our care entr e tm program 
also  our ability to attract and retain marketing representatives could be negatively affected by adverse publicity relating to our care entr e tm program and operations 
under our network marketing system  the marketing representatives downline organizations are headed by a relatively small number of key representatives who are responsible for a substantial percentage of our total revenues 
the loss of a significant number of marketing representatives  including any key representatives  for any reason  could adversely affect our revenues and operating results  and could impair our ability to attract new distributors 
a large part of our revenues are dependent on key relationships with a few private label resellers and we may become more dependent on sales by a few private label resellers 
our revenues from sales of our independent marketing representatives have declined and continue to decline 
as a result  we have become more dependent on sales made by private label resellers to whom we sell our discount medical programs 
if sales made by our independent marketing representatives continue to decline or if our efforts 
table of contents to increase sales through private label resellers succeed  we may become more dependent on sales made by our private label resellers 
because a large number of these sales may be made by a few resellers  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by the loss of our relationship with any of those private label resellers 
development and maintenance of relationships with preferred provider organizations are critical and the loss of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as part of our business operations  we must develop and maintain relationships with preferred provider organizations within each market area that our services are offered 
development and maintenance of these relationships with healthcare providers within a preferred provider organization is in part based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
because many members that receive healthcare services are self insured and responsible for payment for healthcare services received  failure to pay or late payments by members may negatively affect our relationship with the preferred provider organizations 
consequently  preferred provider organization relationships may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships and members failures to pay for services received 
the loss of a preferred provider organization within a geographic market area may not be replaced on a timely basis  if at all  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently rely heavily on one key preferred provider organization and the loss of or a change in our relationship with this provider could have a material adverse effect on our business 
private healthcare systems phcs  a division of multiplan  inc  is the preferred provider organization through which most of our members obtain savings on medical services through our care entr e program 
the loss of phcs as a preferred provider organization or a disruption of our members access to phcs could affect our ability to retain our members and could  therefore  adversely affect our business 
while we currently enjoy a good relationship with phcs and multiplan  there are no assurances that we will continue to have a good relationship with them in the future  or that multiplan  having recently acquired phcs  may choose to change its business strategy in a way that adversely affects us by either limiting or terminating our members access to the phcs network or by entering into agreements with our competitors to provide their members access to phcs 
we face competition for marketing representatives as well as competitive offerings of healthcare products and services 
within the healthcare savings membership industry competition for members is becoming more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of such products and services through other channels of distribution 
some of our private label resellers have chosen to sell a product that is competitive to ours in order to maintain multiple sources for their products 
others may also choose to sell competing products 
furthermore  marketing representatives have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our business operations compete in two channels of competition 
first  we compete based upon the healthcare products and services offered 
these competitors include companies that offer healthcare products and services through membership programs much like our programs  as well as insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks and other organizations that offer benefit programs to their customers 
second  we compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new marketing representatives 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
we provide no assurance that our competitors will not provide healthcare benefit programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership prices or adapt more quickly to evolving healthcare industry trends or changing industry requirements 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  
table of contents and loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
government regulation may adversely affect or limit our operations 
most of the discount medical programs that we offer through our consumer plan division are sold without the need for an insurance license by any federal  state or local regulatory licensing agency or commission 
in comparison  companies that provide insurance benefits and operate healthcare management organizations and preferred provider organizations are regulated by state licensing agencies and commissions 
these regulations extensively cover operations  including scope of benefits  rate formula  delivery systems  utilization review procedures  quality assurance  enrollment requirements  claim payments  marketing and advertising 
several states have enacted laws and regulations overseeing discount medical plans 
we do not know the full extent of these regulations and additional states may also impose regulation 
our need to comply with these regulations may adversely affect or limit our future operations 
the cost of complying with these laws and regulations has and will likely continue to have a material effect on our financial position 
government regulation of health and life insurance  annuities and healthcare coverage and health plans is a changing area of law and varies from state to state 
although we are not an insurance company  the insurance companies from which we obtain our products and financial services are subject to various federal and state regulations applicable to their operations 
these insurance companies must comply with constantly evolving regulations and make changes occasionally to services  products  structure or operations in accordance with the requirements of those regulations 
we may also be limited in how we market and distribute our products and financial services as a result of these laws and regulations 
we have a fiduciary responsibility to our members through our total care and essential care program offerings 
in this capacity  we could be liable for the loss of members funds deposited with us in personal medical accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a medical savings program through our total care and essential care programs that were processed through our subsidiary  foresight  and are now processed through our subsidiary  access administrators  inc  as a third party administrator 
under this medical savings program  funds collected from members are held in personal medical accounts for the benefit of the member as a source of payment for healthcare services obtained through our total care and essential care programs 
under the medical savings program we have a fiduciary responsibility to our members for the funds held for their benefit much like a trustee 
in the unforeseen event of a loss of these funds while being held by us or our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal controls  we will be responsible and liable to the affected members for any such loss  including any consequential damages suffered by the members  which liability could be substantial 
we have terminated this program and the amounts held in our members personal medical accounts has been returned to the individual account holders 
nevertheless  our risk for the funds that had been held in those accounts remains with regard to previously completed transactions 
as a result of the introduction of personal medical accounts  our financial position and results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted by a decrease in the number of healthcare savings program memberships that we can sell and maintain 
while we believe that the introduction of our personal medical accounts pmas was an important product evolution  the initial impact of this introduction has negatively affected our business 
this impact is the result of additional difficulties in selling and maintaining memberships in our program because of the added complexity 
although we have terminated our pma program  there is no assurance that we will be able to overcome these difficulties  and we may not be able to increase the number of memberships that are sold and maintained 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected 

table of contents the failure of our network marketing organization to comply with federal and state regulation could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalties  modification of our network marketing system  and negative publicity 
our network marketing organization is subject to federal and state laws and regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that product and service sales are ultimately made to consumers as opposed to other marketing representatives and that advancement within the network marketing organization is based on sales of products and services  rather than on investment in the company or other non retail sales related criteria 
the compensation structure of a network marketing organization is very complex 
compliance with all of the applicable regulations and laws is uncertain because of the evolving interpretations of existing laws and regulations  and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining in general to network marketing organizations and product and service distribution 
accordingly  there is the risk that our network marketing system could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations that could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalty  require modification of the marketing representative network system  result in negative publicity  or have a negative effect on distributor morale and loyalty 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as well as our financial condition 
the legality of our network marketing organization is subject to challenge by our marketing representatives  which could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our network marketing organization is subject to legality challenge by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
generally  these challenges would be based on claims that our marketing network program was operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
proceedings resulting from these claims could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments  or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may have exposure and liability relating to non compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the cost of compliance could be material 
in april privacy regulations promulgated by the department of health and human services pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa imposes extensive restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities 
also as part of hipaa  the department of health and human services has issued final regulations standardizing electronic transactions between health plans  providers and clearinghouses 
healthcare plans  providers and claims administrators are required to conform their electronic and data processing systems to hipaa electronic transaction requirements 
while we believe we are currently compliant with these regulations  we cannot be certain of the extent to which the 
table of contents enforcement or interpretation of these regulations will affect our business 
our continuing compliance with these regulations  therefore  may have a significant impact on our business operations and may be at material cost in the event we are subject to these regulations 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal and civil sanctions 
disruptions in our operations due to implementation of our management information system may occur and could adversely affect our client relationships 
we recently transitioned to our new management information system 
this is a proprietary system and we do not rely on any third party for its support and maintenance 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue operating without experiencing any disruptions in our operations or that our relationships with our members  marketing representatives or providers will not be adversely affected or that our internal controls will not be adversely affected 
we have many competitors and may not be able to compete effectively which may lead to a lack of revenues and discontinuance of our operations 
we compete with numerous well established companies that design and implement membership programs and other healthcare programs 
some of our competitors may be companies that have programs that are functionally similar or superior to our programs 
most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than us 
they may also have established reputations relating to their programs 
due to competitive market forces  we may experience price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in the future  any of which would result in decreases in sales and revenues 
these decreases in revenues would adversely affect our business and results of operations and could lead to discontinuance of operations

the goodwill acquired pursuant to our acquisitions of the capella group and aai may become further impaired and require a write down and the recognition of an impairment expense that may be substantial 
in connection with our acquisitions of the capella group and aai  we recorded goodwill that had an aggregate asset value of  at december  this carrying value has been reduced through impairment charges of  including tax considerations of  in   in  and  in in the event that the goodwill is determined to be further impaired for any reason  we will be required to write down or reduce the value of the goodwill and recognize an additional impairment expense 
the impairment expense may be substantial in amount and  in such case  adversely affect the results of our operations for the applicable period and may negatively affect the market value of our common stock 
our subsidiary  aai  derives a large percentage of its income from a few key clients and the loss of any of those clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
aai provides full service third party administration services to adjudicate and pay medical claims for employers who have self funded all or any portion of their healthcare costs 
their primary market is governmental entities in the metropolitan area of el paso  texas  including cities and school districts 
there is a limited number of these types of entities within that metropolitan area 
during we incurred a  goodwill impairment charge including tax considerations of  as a result of the reduction in the number of lives covered under plans we administer 
there is no assurance that aai will obtain renewal or extension of those contracts in the 
table of contents loss of any of these contractual relationships will adversely affect on our operating results and the loss of more than one of these contractual relationships could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may find it difficult to integrate icm s business and operations with our business and operations 
although we believe that icm s marketing and distribution of insurance products and financial services will complement and fit well with our business and the need for marketing of our healthcare savings programs and third party claims administration services  icm s business is new to us 
our unfamiliarity with this business may make it more difficult to integrate icm s operations with ours 
we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger acquisition unless we successfully integrate the operations of icm and its subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we are dependent on third party service providers and the failure of such service providers to adequately provide services to us could affect our financial results because such failure could affect our relationship with our customers 
as a cost efficiency measure  we have entered into agreements with third parties for their provision of services to us in exchange for a monthly fee normally calculated on a per member basis 
these services include the enrollment of members through different media  operation of a member services call center  claims administration  billing and collection services  and the production and distribution of fulfillment member marketing materials 
one of these is our agreement with lifeguard emergency travel  inc lifeguard for the provision of these services to many of our members and prospective members 
as a result of these outsourcing agreements  we may lose direct control over these key functions and operations 
the failure by lifeguard or any of our other third party service providers to perform the services to the same or similar level of quality that we could provide could adversely affect our relationships with our members  customers  marketing representatives and our ability to retain and attract members  customers  marketing representatives and  accordingly  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the availability of our insurance products and financial services are dependent on our strategic relationships with various insurance companies and the unavailability of those products and services for any reason may result in significant loss of revenues 
we are not an insurance company and only market and distribute insurance products and financial services developed and offered by insurance companies 
we must develop and maintain relationships with insurance companies that provide products and services for a particular market segment the elderly  the young family  etc 
that we in turn make available to the independent agents with whom they have contracted to sell the products and services to the individual consumer 
of the eight insurance companies with whom icm and its subsidiaries had strategic relationships prior to our acquisition  more than of and revenue of icm and its subsidiaries was attributable to the insurance products and financial services offered by five of the companies 
thus  we are dependent on a relatively small number of insurance companies to provide product and financial services for sale through our channels 
development and maintenance of relationships with the insurance companies may in part be based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
consequently  the relationships with insurance companies may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships 
our success and growth depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain these strategic relationships  contractual or otherwise  with various insurance companies to provide their products and services  including those insurance products and financial services that may be developed in the future 
the loss or termination of these strategic relationships could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
furthermore  the loss or termination may also impair our ability to maintain and attract new insurance agencies and their agents to distribute the insurance products and services that we offer 

table of contents we are dependent upon independent insurance agencies and their agents to offer and sell our insurance products and financial services 
we are principally dependent upon independent insurance agencies and their agents to offer and sell the insurance products and financial services that we offer and distribute 
these insurance agencies and their agents may offer and distribute insurance products and financial services that are competitive with ours 
these independent agencies and their agents may give higher priority and greater incentives financial or otherwise to other insurance products or financial services  reducing their efforts devoted to marketing and distribution of the insurance products and financial services that we offer 
also  our ability to attract and retain independent insurance agencies could be negatively affected by adverse publicity relating to our products and services or our operations 
furthermore  of the approximately  independent agents with whom icm and its subsidiaries had active distribution and marketing relationships prior to our acquisition  more than of the revenues of icm and its subsidiaries was attributable to the product sales and financial services through approximately  independent insurance agents 
these agents report through approximately independent general agencies 
thus  we are dependent on a small number of independent insurance agencies for a very significant percentage of our total insurance products and financial services revenue 
development and maintenance of the relationships with independent insurance agencies and their agents may in part be based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
consequently  these relationships may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships 
the loss of a significant number of the independent insurance agencies and their agents  as well as the loss of a key agency or its agents  for any reason  could adversely affect our revenue and operating results  or could impair our ability to establish new relationships or continue strategic relationships with independent insurance agencies and their agents 
we face intense competition in the market place for our products and services as well as competition for insurance agencies and their agents for the marketing of the products and services offered 
instead of utilizing captive or wholly owned insurance agencies for the offer and sale of its products and services  we utilize independent insurance agencies and their agents as the principal marketing and distribution channel 
competition for independent insurance agencies and their agents is intense 
also  competition from products and services similar to or directly in competition with the products and services that we offer is intense  including those products and services offered and sold through the same channels utilized for distribution of our insurance products and financial services 
under arrangements with the independent insurance agencies  the agencies and their agents may offer and sell a variety of insurance products and financial services  including those that compete with the insurance products and financial services that we offer 
thus  our business operations compete in two channels of competition 
first  we compete based upon the insurance products and financial services offered 
this competition includes products and services of insurance companies that compete with the products and services of the insurance companies that we offered and sell 
second  we compete with all types of marketing and distribution companies throughout the us for independent insurance agencies and their agents 
many of our competitors have substantially larger bases of insurance companies providing products and services  and longer term established relationships with independent insurance agencies and agents for the sale and distribution of products and services  as well as greater financial and other resources 
there is no assurance that our competitors will not provide insurance products and financial services comparable or superior to those products and services that we offer at lower costs or prices  greater sales incentives financial or otherwise or adapt more quickly to evolving insurance industry trends or changing industry requirements 
increased competition may result in reduced margins on product sales and services  less than anticipated sales or reduced sales  and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview consumer healthcare savings 
we offer savings on healthcare services throughout the united states to persons who are uninsured and under insured 
these savings are offered by accessing the same preferred provider organizations ppos that are utilized by many insurance companies 
these programs are sold primarily through a network marketing strategy under the name care entr e 
tm we design these programs to benefit healthcare providers as well as the network members 
providers commonly give reduced or preferred rates to ppo networks in exchange for steerage of patients 
however  the providers must still file claim forms and wait to days to be paid for their services 
our programs utilize these same networks to obtain the same savings for the care entr e tm program members 
however  the healthcare providers are paid immediately for their services and are not required to file claim forms 
we provide transaction facilitation services to both the program member and the healthcare provider 
our independent marketing representatives imrs may enroll as representatives by paying an enrollment fee and signing a standard representative agreement 
we pay independent marketing representatives commissions equal to of the membership fees of members they enroll for the life of that members enrollment 
independent marketing representatives can also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those recruited representatives 
in the month of membership sales  no override commissions are paid to the representative s upline 
the total regular or ongoing commissions payout  including overrides on monthly 
table of contents membership sales after the enrollment month and our contribution to the bonus pools  is up to of qualified membership sales 
we also design healthcare membership programs for employer groups and third party marketers 
memberships in these programs are offered and sold by direct marketing through direct sales or in bound direct marketing 
we believe that our clients  their members and the vendors of the products and services offered through the programs  all benefit from our membership service programs 
the products and services are bundled  priced and marketed utilizing relationship marketing strategies or inbound direct marketing to target the profiled needs of the clients particular member base 
our memberships sold by third party organizations are generally marketed using the third party s name or brand or under our wholesale brand for your good health 
we refer to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs or private label programs 
while the services offered to consumers by these private label programs are generally similar to the services we offer through care entr e tm  each of the private label programs can bundle our services to fit the needs of their consumers 
for instance  some of our private label programs do not offer a self funded escrow program to their members 
employer and group healthcare services 
for governments and other large  self funded employers seeking to reduce their costs of provided employee healthcare benefits  we offer a more streamlined version of our healthcare products and programs 
in these cases  we offer access to healthcare through our network of providers and the efficient repricing of bills through our proprietary systems 
we can offer these services on a price based on either the number of participants per month or as a percentage of savings on healthcare costs actually realized 
through aai  we provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by governments and other employers who have chosen to self fund their employee healthcare benefits 
with the services of aai  we offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
we are able to provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical savings accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
aai s primary area of expertise is in the public sector market 
financial services discontinued 
until december  we reported the financial results of our wholly owned subsidiary care financial of texas  llc care financial and care in this segment 
care financial offered high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies and care offered life insurance and annuities  along with healthcare savings accounts hsas  healthcare reimbursement arrangements hras and medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts fsas 
care was discontinued in december and care financial s results of operations for were immaterial and are now included in the corporate and other segment 
rental purchase and club membership programs discontinued 
until december  through foresight  we designed club membership programs for rental purchase companies  financial organizations  employer groups  retailers and association based organizations 
memberships in these programs were offered and sold as part of a point of sale transaction or by direct marketing through direct mail or as inserts 
program members are offered and provided our third party vendors products and services 
the products and services were bundled  priced and marketed to target the profiled needs of the clients particular customer base 
most of our club membership programs were sold by third party organizations  generally in connection with a point of sale transaction 
we referred to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs 
in december  we sold substantially all of the assets of this subsidiary and discontinued its operations 
operational review the year ended december  was another year of significant challenge 
we implemented member escrow accounts during the fourth quarter of in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry  and on october   we expanded the escrow requirements to all programs offering access to medical doctors and physicians 
as a result of this change  we required all of our members other than those whose memberships are sold by our private label partners to fund and maintain personal medical accounts pmas to provide the healthcare providers with a form of payment assurance prior to receipt of healthcare services 
as of december  we discontinued these pmas and returned the funds held in escrow to the appropriate members 

table of contents our healthcare membership base was approximately  members as of december   as compared to  members as of december  and  members as of december   a decrease of approximately  members or during the reduction in our healthcare membership base resulted from declining market share in the healthcare savings market  due in part to the implementation of the required pmas  as well as provider acceptance issues in some markets 
also  our independent marketing representative base experienced a significant reduction in through we believe that the pma requirements implemented in late negatively impacted our membership base and consequently our revenues and net earnings in  and these accounts were implemented to help provide assurance of payment to the healthcare providers and accordingly  their continued willingness to provide healthcare services to our members 
this strategic move was thought to be necessary as many healthcare providers throughout the united states were reluctant to accept a health discount card 
in order to address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers  we have recently implemented enhanced levels of customer advocacy in lieu of pmas 
for healthcare cases that are anticipated to cost a significant amount  we assign a personal negotiator who will review our member s financial situation and explain cost savings options that they may want to discuss with their physician 
depending on their financial resources  our negotiator may pursue a variety of options with the hospital or other healthcare facility to make payment arrangements upfront including helping the member apply for financial assistance or negotiating a reduced down payment or discounted fee 
we have also developed a line of affordable insurance products that are sometimes referred to as scheduled benefit  limited benefit or defined benefit products 
these products may be less expensive than traditional comprehensive healthcare insurance and usually do not require the member to undergo any medical underwriting 
as such  they are available to all individuals  regardless of health condition 
the products usually operate on an indemnity basis  reimbursing the member for certain of his or her incurred costs 
sometimes  the products allow the benefit to be assigned directly to the provider  eliminating the need for the member to pay the provider directly and then seek reimbursement 
these products pay a defined amount for services 
for instance  a member could choose a program entitling him or her to a benefit payment of  or  per day of hospitalization  with additional scheduled benefits for intensive care stays and surgery  for up to days 
the sale of some of these programs requires an insurance license 
in this case  we will sell the products only through our representatives that hold the appropriate license 
some of these programs  however  will be offered at no cost to the member as part of the member s enrollment in an association 
in this case  the sale of the membership does not require a license in most states 
we commenced sales of these new products in the first quarter of while it is too early to assess the market acceptance of these new products  it is hoped that they and our enhanced customer advocacy will address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers more successfully than the escrow or pma products

in  we introduced vergance  a new network marketing distribution channel as a division of the company 
vergance offered wellness products  including nutraceuticals under the retail name natrience  and discounted healthcare services under the retail name quickcare 
vergance was discontinued in the second quarter of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenue recognition varies based on source 
healthcare membership revenues 
we recognize our care entr e tm program membership revenues  other than initial enrollment fees  on each monthly anniversary date 
membership revenues are reduced by the 
table of contents amount of estimated refunds 
for members that are billed directly  the billed amount is collected almost entirely by electronic charge to the members credit cards  automated clearinghouse or electronic check 
the settlement of those charges occurs within a day or two 
under certain private label arrangements  our private label partners bill their members for the membership fees and our portion of the membership fees is periodically remitted to us 
during the time from the billing of these private label membership fees and the remittance to us  we record a receivable from the private label partners and record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the allowance of uncollectible receivables is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances  the credit worthiness of the private label partner and its history of paying the agreed amounts owed 
membership enrollment fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the estimated membership period that averages eight to ten months 
independent marketing representative fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the term of the applicable contract 
judgment is involved in the allocation of costs to determine the direct costs netted against those deferred revenues  as well as in estimating the membership period over which to amortize such net revenue 
we maintain a statistical analysis of the costs and membership periods as a basis for adjusting these estimates from time to time 
aai third party administration 
aai s principal sources of revenues include administrative fees for third party claims administration  network provider fees for the preferred provider network and utilization and management fees 
these fees are based on monthly or per member per month fee schedules under specified contractual agreements 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which the services are performed and when collection is reasonably assured 
commission expense 
commissions are paid to our independent marketing representatives in the month following the month in which a member has enrolled in or renewed our care entr e tm program 
commissions are only paid in the following month when we have received the related monthly membership fees 
we do not pay advanced commissions on membership sales 
commissions are based on established commission schedules and are determined and accrued based upon the recognition of the related healthcare membership revenue  as described above 
acquisitions 
in  we acquired aai for an ultimate purchase price of  after contingent consideration that included  of goodwill   of working capital and  of fixed assets 
in  aai recorded a  impairment to goodwill including tax considerations of  that resulted from current and projected reductions in earnings primarily due to a decline in the number of lives covered under plans that it administers 
fixed assets 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
the estimation of useful lives is based  in part  upon past experience with similar assets and upon our plans for the utilization of the assets in the future 
we periodically review fixed assets  including software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated 
when any value impairment is determined to exist  the related assets are written down to their fair value 
if we determine that the remaining useful life  based upon known events and circumstances  should be shortened  the depreciation or amortization of the related asset is adjusted on a prospective  going forward basis based upon the shortened useful lives 
intangible asset valuation 
our intangible assets consisted primarily of  of goodwill as of december  goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
in  aai recorded a  impairment to goodwill including tax considerations of  that resulted from current and projected reductions in earnings primarily due to a decline in the number of lives covered under plans that it administered and capella recorded a charge of  due to the continuing decline in members and revenues 
in  capella recorded a charge of  due to continuing decline in members and revenues to a lower level than previously predicted and pending litigation and regulatory 
table of contents activity that was announced in the second quarter 
in  our intangible assets were reduced by  to reflect impairment of the goodwill related to our acquisition in of foresight 
significant judgments and estimates were required in connection with the impairment test to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit 
we retained and engaged an independent valuation consultant to estimate fair values of aai and capella using discounted cash flow projections and other valuation methodologies in evaluating and measuring a potential goodwill impairment charges 
based upon management s cash flow projections and the consultant s independent valuation  we recorded a goodwill impairment related to aai and capella in and capella in  as previously discussed 
to the extent that  in the future  our estimates change or our stock price decreases  further goodwill write downs may occur 
those assessments of the carrying value of goodwill were each reviewed and approved by our audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
during  we evaluated the probability of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets through the reduction of taxes otherwise payable in the future and increased the allowance by  from  to  against the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets because in our opinion it is more probable than not that some of those assets will not be realized 
reclassifications

our consumer healthcare savings programs having been under continuing pressure from increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny  as well as the unwillingness of some healthcare providers to accept our savings cards based on concerns over assurance of payment 
in late  we implemented an escrow account requirement to address provider concerns over assurance of payment 
while this feature had 
table of contents shown limited success in improving acceptance by providers  it made our programs more complex and difficult to sell 
as of december  we discontinued these pmas and returned the funds that we held in those accounts to own customers 
in some of the states in which we have a significant number of members  especially florida  texas and california  our healthcare savings products are under scrutiny and criticism by state regulators and officials 
this regulatory scrutiny has impaired our ability to market these products in those states and elsewhere  further contributing to the decline in membership enrollments and increases in terminated memberships

in order to address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers  we have recently implemented enhanced levels of customer advocacy in lieu of pmas 
we have also developed a line of affordable insurance products that are sometimes referred to as scheduled benefit  limited benefit or defined benefit policies 
these products may be less expensive than traditional comprehensive health insurance and usually do not require the member to undergo any medical underwriting 
as such  they are available to all individuals  regardless of health condition 
we commenced sales of these new products in the first quarter of while it is too early to assess the market acceptance of these new products  it is hoped that they and our enhanced customer advocacy will address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers more successfully than the escrow or pma products 
throughout  we have continued the measures and initiatives commenced earlier in the year to improve our operating efficiencies and performance  especially through cost reductions 
these measures and initiatives include i the conversion of certain of our customer service and system support functions from a fixed to a variable cost structure by outsourcing them  ii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  and iii personnel reductions and other cost reduction actions 
the resulting restructuring costs incurred during the fourth quarter of for these initiatives were  that included write off of assets no longer used of  outsourcing vendor integration and moving costs of  and personnel severance costs of  these measures have successfully reduced the cost structure associated with our care entr e tm and private label membership programs 
during the first quarter of  we resumed sales of our consumer healthcare savings products to on or our former private label reseller who  in early  had discontinued sales of those products 
cost of operations 
the decrease in cost of operations from to was due to decreases in variable costs of  primarily due to decreased provider network costs and bank fees related to the decreased revenue  along with reductions in fixed costs of  primarily related to termination of certain equipment leases and personnel reductions related to cost reduction initiatives  offset by fourth quarter restructuring costs of  for certain leased equipment and inventory write offs and personnel severance costs related to our outsourcing initiative 
the decrease in cost of operations from to is also due to decreases in provider network costs and bank fees related to decreased revenue and reductions in equipment lease and personnel costs related to cost reduction initiatives 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
the decreases in sales and marketing expenses from to and from to were primarily due to decreases in commissions related to the decreased membership revenue of the care entr e tm program of  and  respectively 
these commission decreases were accentuated by the departure of independent marketing representatives from the upper ranks of our multi level marketing network through which our care entr e tm program is offered and elimination of the associated over ride commissions  resulting in a lower percentage of commissions as a percent of revenue 
the decrease from to was offset by an increase in consulting and other marketing costs of  related to various sales and new product initiatives 
the decrease from to was partially offset by  of personnel severance costs incurred in general and administrative expenses

aai helps us offer a more complete suite of healthcare service products 
also through aai  we provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
employer and group healthcare services revenues during decreased primarily due to the loss of two major customers in the latter part of and a third in june of revenues during increased from primarily because results of operations for aai were only included since the date of its acquisition on june  had aai s results of operations been included throughout  revenues for this segment would have been  while operating income would have been  the increase in pro forma
