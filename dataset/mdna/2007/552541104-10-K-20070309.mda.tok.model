the company accounted for the clarke american acquisition as a purchase  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which resulted in valuations for clarke american s consolidated assets and liabilities based on fair values as of the date of the clarke american acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price in the clarke american acquisition results in higher depreciation and amortization expense in the periods following the clarke american acquisition compared to prior periods

licorice products mafco worldwide is the world s largest producer of licorice products 
mafco worldwide produces a variety of licorice products from licorice root  intermediary licorice extracts and derivatives produced by its joint venture facilities in china and others and certain other ingredients at its facilities in the us  france and the people s republic of china 
approximately of mafco worldwide s licorice sales are to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco 
while licorice represents a small percentage of the total cost of manufacturing american blend cigarettes and other tobacco products  the particular formulation and quality used by each brand is an important element in the brand s quality 
in addition  mafco worldwide manufactures and sells natural products for use in the tobacco industry 
worldwide consumption of american blend cigarettes has declined approximately to per year for the past five years 
manufacturers of cigarettes are subject to regulations in the us at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries and an increase in excise and other taxes on cigarettes have all contributed to this worldwide decline in consumption 
the us production of chewing tobacco products has declined steadily for more than a decade 
this decline has been partially offset by an increase in moist snuff volumes 
mafco worldwide also sells licorice worldwide to confectioners  food processors  cosmetic companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers for use as flavoring and masking agents  including its magnasweet brand flavor enhancer  which is used in various brands of chewing gum  lip balm  energy bars  non carbonated beverages  chewable vitamins  aspirin and other products 
although mafco worldwide s licorice sales to its confectionary customers have experienced a decline in recent years  magnasweet sales to food  cosmetic and pharmaceutical customers  have experienced some growth and added to mafco worldwide s overall sales stability for its licorice products 
one important facet of mafco worldwide s business strategy is to focus on growing its business through sales of licorice derived products for use in non tobacco related applications 
mafco worldwide is devoting a substantial portion of its research and development efforts to magnasweet and its potential food and beverage applications as well as to finding additional uses for components of licorice extract in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products 
mafco worldwide also sells licorice root residue as garden mulch under the name right dress 
other non licorice product sales have decreased due to mafco worldwide s decision to discontinue selling these products 
the reorganization on october   the company completed an internal reorganization the reorganization with certain of its subsidiaries to separate the assets and liabilities related to its licorice products business from the assets and liabilities not related to its licorice products business 
prior to the reorganization  pneumo abex corporation held all the assets and liabilities associated with the licorice products business  as well as other assets and liabilities unrelated to the licorice products business 
in connection with the reorganization  mafco worldwide was formed  and pneumo abex corporation transferred all of the assets and liabilities related to that licorice products business to mafco worldwide 
following the transfer of the licorice products business to mafco worldwide  pneumo abex corporation merged with pneumo abex llc  a newly formed  wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
mafco worldwide then transferred all of the membership interests in pneumo abex llc to another subsidiary of the company  which resulted in pneumo abex llc no longer being a subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
the reorganization had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents economic and other factors affecting the businesses of the company clarke american while total non cash payments including checks  credit cards  debit cards and other electronic forms of payment are growing  the number of checks written has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
clarke american believes the number of checks printed is driven by the number of checks written  the number of new checking accounts opened and reorders reflecting changes in consumers personal situations  such as name or address changes 
checks written remain one of the largest forms of non cash payment in the us the financial institution outsourcing services industry is highly competitive and fragmented with quality and breadth of service offerings and strength of customer relationships among the key competitive factors 
within this category  clarke american competes with large outsourcing service providers that offer a wide variety of services including those that compete with clarke american s primary offerings specifically payment services  marketing services  and teleservices 
there are also other competitors that specialize in providing one or more of these services 
the financial institution segment s operating results are also modestly impacted by consumer confidence and employment 
consumer confidence directly correlates with consumer spending  while employment also impacts revenues through the number of new checking accounts being opened 
to a lesser degree  business confidence impacts a portion of the financial institution segment 
the direct to consumer segment s operating results are also driven by consumer confidence and employment 
consumer confidence directly correlates with consumer spending  while employment also impacts revenues through the number of new checking accounts opened 
mafco worldwide developments and trends within the tobacco industry may have a material effect on the operations of mafco worldwide 
worldwide consumption of american blend cigarettes has declined approximately to per year for the past five years 
manufacturers of cigarettes are subject to regulation in the us at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  an increase in excise and other taxes on cigarettes and a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to this worldwide decline in consumption 
consumption of chewing tobacco and moist snuff is concentrated primarily in the us domestic consumption of chewi ng tobacco products has declined by approximately to per year over the past five years 
moist snuff consumption has increased approximately to per year over the past five years due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking and smokeless tobacco 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the us at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
together with changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  a constant expansion of tobacco regulations worldwide has been a major cause for the decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry 
restrictive foreign tobacco legislation has been on the rise in recent years as well  including restrictions on where tobacco may be sold and used  warning labels and other graphic packaging images  product constituent limitations and a general increase in taxes 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
in part as a result of settlements in certain of this litigation  the cigarette companies have significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup the cost of the settlements 
since  cigarette consumption in the us has decreased due to the higher prices of cigarettes  the increased emphasis on the health effects of cigarettes and the continuing restrictions on smoking areas 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign 
table of contents governments have increased or proposed increases to such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  pensions  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  as well as other assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of ass ets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
inventories the majority of the company s inventories consists of licorice raw materials 
licorice raw materials have an infinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company determines cost principally by the first in  first out method  with the exception of clarke american s finished goods inventories purchased from external suppliers  which are stated at moving average cost and inventories manufactured internally by clarke american  which are stated at average cost 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
prepaid rebates clarke american has contracts with certain financial institution clients that require prepayment of rebates 
the prepaid rebates are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective contracts as a reduction of revenue 
this accounting method conforms with the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force item no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product 
the contracts generally allow clarke american to recoup portions of these prepayments in the event that a contract is terminated early 
any amounts repaid would represent the original prepayment adjusted to consider the number of unexpired contract periods 
the unamortized prepaid rebates balance is included in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
advertising direct response advertising is capitalized and amortized over its expected period of future benefit 
direct response advertising consists primarily of inserts that include order coupons for checks in the mail s products and are amortized for a period of up to months 
certain custom advertising pieces for clarke american have been capitalized and are amortized over months following their distribution 
amortization is charged to match the advertising expense with the related revenue streams 
other advertising activities include product catalogs and price sheets  which are expensed when issued to clarke american s financial institution clients for use 
income taxes the company estimates actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
the balance of the valuation allowance at december   was million 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular 
table of contents basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment  amortizable intangible assets and investments in joint ventures whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
spacer

significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and 
spacer 
gif

spacer 
gif 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired using the purchase method 
goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted cash flow models using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values of the company s reporting units  which include the goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s lsquo  implied fair value requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of product formulations and certain tradenames and trademarks  based on projected discounted cash flows 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates made by management in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units and its indefinite lived intangible assets 
there is inherent subjectivity involved in estimated future cash flows 
these estimates are susceptible to change from period to period because management must make assumptions about future cash flows  profitability  terminal values and other items 
changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are evaluated for impairment as discussed above in long lived assets 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability 
table of contents that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
when evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery related to those liabilities  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by indemnification is remote 
see item business the tobacco industry and non operating contingent liability  indemnification and insurance matters  item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pensions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  which cover certain current and former employees of the company who meet eligibility requirements 
the company s actuarial consultants use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
d ifferences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension income expense and asset liability that the company recorded 
derivatives the company began using derivative financial instruments in to manage interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the company recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in other comprehensive income until the underlying debt instrument being hedged is settled or the company determines that the specific hedge accounting criteria are no longer met 
on the date the interest rate derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company links all hedges that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments 
the company links all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions or to liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company also assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  wheth er the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if an existing derivative were to become not highly effective as a hedge  the company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge based on total changes in the hedge s cash flows at each payment date as compared to the change in the expected future cash flows on the long term debt

accordingly  mafco worldwide must periodically build its raw materials supply in order avoid material shortages or significant raw material price increases 
shortages of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  will be adequate to make required payments on its indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flow risks each of clarke american s and mafco worldwide s ability to meet their respective debt service obligations and reduce their total debt will depend upon their respective ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond each s respective control 
each of clarke american and mafco worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to it under its credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its debt or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if future cash flow from operations and other capit al resources are insufficient to pay each s respective obligations as they mature or to fund its liquidity needs  clarke american or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity 
clarke american or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of their respective existing and future indebtedness may limit their ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

table of contents mafco worldwide may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
mafco worldwide tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for two to three years 
at december   mafco worldwide had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material between two and three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although mafco worldwide has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw materials are obtained  mafco worldwide may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw materials due to these or other instabilities 
if mafco worldwide is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is unable to obtain them in a cost effective manner  mafco worldwide s business will be severely hampered and mafco worldwide will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  seven of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues and approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
one customer  altria group inc  accounted for approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues and approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues 
if altria group inc were to stop purchasing licorice from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of mafco worldwide and the company  which would also create severe liquidity problems for mafco worldwide and the company 
non operating contingent liability  indemnification and insurance matters the company is indemnified by third parties with respect to certain of its contingent liabilities  such as certain environmental and asbestos matters  as well as certain tax and other matters 
in  a subsidiary of mcg  m f worldwide and two subsidiaries of m f worldwide entered into the transfer agreement 
under the transfer agreement  pneumo abex  then a subsidiary of m f worldwide  retained the assets and liabilities relating to aerospace  as well as certain contingent liabilities and the related assets  including its historical insurance and indemnification arrangements 
pneumo abex transferred substantially all of its other assets and liabilities to a subsidiary of mcg 
the transfer agreement provides for appropriate transfer  indemnification and tax sharing arrangements  in a manner consistent with applicable law and existing contractual arrangements 
the transfer agreement requires such subsidiary of mcg to undertake certain administrative and funding obligations with respect to certain categories of asbestos related claims and other liabilities  including environmental claims  retained by pneumo abex 
the company will be obligated to reimburse the amounts so funded only when the company receives amounts under related indemnification and insurance agreements 
such administrative and funding obligations would be terminated as to these categories of asbestos related claims in the case of a bankruptcy of pneumo abex or m f worldwide or of certain other events affecting the availability of coverage for such claims from third party indemnitors and insurers 
in the event of ce rtain kinds of disputes with pneumo abex s indemnitors regarding their indemnities  the transfer agreement permits the company to require such subsidiary to fund of the costs of resolving the disputes 
prior to  a former subsidiary of pneumo abex manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor has ultimate responsibility for all the remaining asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by pneumo abex in december of its friction products division  the second indemnitor assumed responsibility for substantially all asbestos related clai ms asserted against pneumo abex after august and not indemnified by the original indemnitor 
federal mogul corporation purchased the second indemnitor in october in october  the second indemnitor filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and stopped performing its indemnity obligations to the company 
performance of the second indemnitor s indemnity obligation is guaranteed by the indemnity guarantor 
since the bankruptcy filing of the second indemnitor  the indemnity guarantor 
table of contents has been fulfilling the second indemnitor s indemnity obligations to the extent that they are no longer being performed by the second indemnitor 
in november  the company entered into a series of agreements with the second indemnitor  the indemnity guarantor and others that proposed a settlement of the company s claims against the second indemnitor relating to its indemnity as part of the bankruptcy reorganization of the second indemnitor 
if the transactions outlined in the agreements are approved by the courts overseeing the second indemnitor s bankruptcy and then consummated  then either a i the company would transfer its interest in pneumo abex to a trust to be created in connection with the second indemnitor s bankruptcy reorganization plan  ii the company would pay million to the trust  and the indemnity guarantor wo uld pay million to the trust and issue a year note to the trust for the payment of million  iii the trust would assume all financial responsibility for the payment of asbestos related claims subject to the second indemnitor s indemnity  and iv a court ordered injunction would bar the assertion of any claim arising out of the asbestos related claims subject to the second indemnitor s indemnity from being asserted against the company  the second indemnitor or the indemnity guarantor items a i through a iv collectively  the plan a settlement or b under certain conditions set forth in the agreements relating to possible difficulties in implementing the plan a settlement  i pneumo abex would continue to be owned by the company but would receive million from the second indemnitor s bankruptcy estate  ii the second indemnitor would be relieved of its indemnification obligation  and iii the indemn ity guarantor would continue to honor its guaranty obligation and receive million from the second indemnitor s bankruptcy estate items b i through b iii collectively  the plan b settlement 
both the plan a settlement and the plan b settlement are subject to various contingencies  including bankruptcy court approval and the effectiveness of the second indemnitor s plan of reorganization 
no assurance can be given regarding whether the agreements can or will be consummated 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which asbestos containing products were manufactured 
the subsidiary commenced litigation in against a portion of these insurers in order to confirm the availability of this coverage 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers and payments by the original indemnitor  the second indemnitor and the indemnity guarantor pursuant to their indemnities  pneumo abex is receiving reimbursement each month for substantially all of its monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims 
as of december   the company incurred or expected to incur approximately million of unindemnified costs  as to which it either has received or expects to receive approximately million in insurance reimbursements 
management does not expect these unindemnified matters to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but pneumo abex is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that the subsidiary of mcg will indemnify pneumo abex with respect to all environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than the operations relating to pneumo abex s aerospace business  which pneumo abex sold to parker hannifin corporation in april accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the company s former aerospace facilities are the responsibility of pneumo abex 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to env ironmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any of the sites subject to the indemnity from the original indemnitor due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable 
table of contents environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the future aggregate cost of cleanup and related expenses with respect to matters for which pneumo abex  together with numerous other third parties  have been named potentially responsible parties should be substantially less than million 
the company has not recognized a liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remot e 
the former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the us government or to private contractors for the us government 
the company retained in the aerospace sale certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the government made with respect to certain of these products 
in the sole remaining matter  the company contests the government s allegations and has been attempting to resolve this matter without litigation 
in addition  various other legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against the company  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  environmental  safety and health matters and other matters 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
in the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

you should read carefully the factors described in the section entitled risk factors of this annual report on form k for a description of certain risks that could  among other things  cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements 
the company assumes no responsibility to update the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financing activities 
in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company entered into interest rate derivative transactions in in the form of a swap for clarke american and a collar for mafco worldwide  as further described in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
at december   mafco worldwide had million of term loans outstanding under the mafco worldwide credit agreement and million outstanding under the mafco worldwide revolving credit facility  including letters of credit 
at december   clarke american had million of term loans outstanding under the clarke american credit agreement and million outstanding under the clarke american revolving credit facility  including letters of credit 
all of these outstanding loans bear interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company is subject to risk due to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to its floating rate d ebt outstanding as of december  would result in an increase or decrease in its annual interest expense of approximately million per year 
the company began using derivative financial instruments in to manage interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
clarke american entered into an interest rate hedge transaction in the form of a three year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  which swaps the underlying variable rate for a fixed rate of 
mafco worldwide entered into an interest rate derivative transaction in the form of two year non cancellable interest rate zero collar with a notional amount of million that caps the underlying variable rate at and sets a floor at 
as of december   the company s net foreign currency market exposures of million are primarily the euro 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
since the exposures are not material  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase to the related net unrealized gain for the year ended december  conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million and decrease to the related net unrealized gain for the year ended december
