 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company s sales contracts generally provide for the customer to accept title and risk of loss when the product leaves the company s facilities 
when shipping terms or local laws do not allow for passage of title and risk of loss at the shipping point  the company defers recognizing revenue until title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company classifies shipping and handling invoiced to customers as revenue and the related costs in cost of sales

if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers that fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
maintenance or service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
for business units that sell software licenses or products in which the software is considered more than incidental  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position  software revenue recognition sop
