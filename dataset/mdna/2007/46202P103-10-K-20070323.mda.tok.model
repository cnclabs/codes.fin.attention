item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which are identified under our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report  that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of vaccines and immune system stimulants delivered to the skin via a novel  needle free technology called transcutaneous immunization tci 
tci exploits the unique benefits of a major group of antigen presenting cells found in the outer layers of the skin langerhans cells to generate an enhanced immune response 
tci has the potential to enhance the efficacy of existing vaccines  enable new vaccines that are viable only through transcutaneous administration and expand the global vaccine market 
we are developing two distinct product applications an immunostimulant  or is  patch and a needle free vaccine patch 
we currently have five product candidates in development four targeting influenza and pandemic flu and one to prevent e 
coli related travelers diarrhea 
our five product candidates are an is patch intended to stimulate an immune response to even small doses of a pandemic flu vaccine  thereby extending vaccine supply in the event of an influenza pandemic  an is patch intended to boost the immune response of the elderly to the standard flu vaccine  a needle free vaccine patch for seasonal flu  a needle free pandemic flu vaccine patch  and a needle free travelers diarrhea vaccine patch 
none of our product candidates has been approved for commercial sale by the fda or any comparable foreign agencies 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial expenses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of our is patch to extend the supply of pandemic flu vaccines  our needle free flu vaccine patch  is patch for elderly receiving flu vaccines  expand the clinical trial program for our needle free travelers diarrhea vaccine patch  continue our existing preclinical development programs  including our needle free pandemic flu vaccine program  and commence new programs  increase our manufacturing capabilities for product candidates  and expand our research and development activities 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our efforts throughout will be focused on conducting additional development for our four product candidates in clinical development  as well as continue to build up our infrastructure to support our operations as a public company 
management review of the following is a summary of key events that occurred during on february   we closed our initial public offering  in which we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds  before expenses  were  our total expenses for the initial public offering were million  so our total net proceeds  after expenses  were million 
in february  the national institutes of health  or nih  awarded us the remaining million available under the last year of a two year grant to fund up to million for further development of our is technology for pandemic flu applications 
we completed work under this grant in the second quarter of in may  we submitted to the department of health and human services  or dhhs  a response to the government s request for proposal rfp for further development of our is patch for pandemic influenza vaccines 
this patch is designed to enhance the immune response to any manufactured pandemic influenza vaccine  an advantage that may allow the public health service to employ a universal dose sparing strategy to extend the supply of vaccine 
in january  dhhs awarded us a five year  cost plus reimbursement contract to fund our development of a dose sparing patch for use with a pandemic flu vaccine 
if the product is developed through licensure  the total cost reimbursed by dhhs  plus a fixed fee  is estimated to be million 
during the first months of the contract  dhhs has allotted approximately million for us to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the patch in two clinical trials and to develop plans on how we would produce million is patches in a six month period  as required under the contract 
once we demonstrate the safety and dose sparing capability of our is patch  we hope to sell up to million is patches to the united states government for its stockpile of pandemic flu products 
during  we completed a number of phase and studies to further advance our dry vaccine patch for travelers diarrhea 
these trials demonstrated  among other things  that our current dry patch formulation achieved high immune responses in those vaccinated and outperformed our earlier liquid based patch and that our travelers diarrhea vaccine patch can be self applied by individuals  not just by healthcare providers 
we also have gathered data that shows that the dry patch is stable for more than months at room temperature 
all of this data could also have important implications not only for our travelers diarrhea program  but for our other programs  particularly our influenza programs  and could form the basis for our development of vaccine patches that could be stockpiled  mailed and self applied all important considerations in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak 
we also initiated during a phase dose ranging study for our travelers diarrhea vaccine patch  as well as a phase field study designed to evaluate the logistics around how to best conduct a larger pivotal field study for our travelers diarrhea program 
we expect data from these two trials to be available during the second quarter of based on these data  we will design an additional phase trial to determine the final dry patch formulation  and that trial is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of during the fall of  we initiated a large  multi center phase trial for our needle free flu vaccine patch 
this study is designed to test the safety and immunogenicity of our needle free flu vaccine in comparison with the traditional injected vaccine 
vaccinations were completed during the first quarter of  and we expect interim data from this trial to be available by the middle of we expect this data to guide us in our design for a phase program that could potentially support licensure of a self administered  needle free flu vaccine patch 
as we do not manufacture commercial flu antigens  we are also actively seeking to collaborate with suppliers of commercial flu antigens in order to advance further development of this program 
in may  we negotiated an extension of our credit facility to finance up to million of additional capital expenditures for our pilot manufacturing plant  as well as for our research and development laboratories 
we drew down the entire million during by the end of third quarter of  we will occupy the entire facility which houses our principal laboratories  pilot manufacturing facility and corporate offices in approximately  square feet 
in july  we amended our lease for the facility to add approximately  square feet  and in january  we signed another amendment to lease the remaining approximately  square feet in the building over the course of first nine months of over the past six months  we have raised approximately million in net proceeds through two separate private placements 
in october  we raised approximately million in net proceeds when we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a private placement to existing stockholders  essex woodlands health ventures and new enterprise associates nea 
then in early march  we raised million in net proceeds when we sold  units  each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and two warrants to purchase  in total  additional shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the purchase price for the share component of each unit is per share 
each warrant provides the right to acquire shares of common stock at an exercise price of per full share 
one warrant is exercisable at any time until march   and the other warrant is exercisable at any time until the date four months after a registration statement for the resale of the shares and the common stock underlying the warrants is declared effective by the sec 
historical results of operations liquidity capital resources revenues our revenues to date have principally been limited to amounts we have received under us federal grant programs 
during  we had one principal active grant  which the nih originally awarded us in january to fund over two years up to million for further development of our is technology for pandemic influenza applications 
in the first quarter of  the nih awarded us the million remaining to be received under this grant for through december   we have been reimbursed for the full million of expenses under this grant 
these amounts include reimbursement for our employees time and benefits and other expenses related to performance under the relevant grants 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to consultants and clinical research organizations in conjunction with their monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  consulting fees paid to third parties in connection with other aspects of our product development efforts  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  depreciation of facilities and equipment used to develop our product candidates  and milestone payments  license fees  and royalty payments for technology licenses 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred  other than those capital expenditures that have alternative future uses  such as the build out of our pilot plant 
due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and the early stage of development of our product candidates  we do not currently track our internal research and development costs by program and cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs 
however  the following table shows  for the periods presented  our estimate of the total costs that have been incurred for our lead product candidates from january  to december  years ended december  cumulative since product candidate january  in thousands is patch for pandemic flu is patch for elderly receiving flu vaccines needle free flu vaccine patch needle free travelers diarrhea vaccine patch other programs total we expect our research and development costs will continue to be substantial and that they will increase as we advance our current portfolio of product candidates through clinical trials and move other product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance and accounting  business development  and corporate development 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services 
with the completion of our initial public offering  our general and administrative expenses have increased due to increased costs for insurance  professional fees  public company reporting requirements  and investor relations costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
in addition  there will likely be further increases going forward related to the hiring of additional personnel 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenues costs expenses research development general administrative total costs expenses other income expense cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net loss revenues 
the million decrease in grant revenues was principally the result of fewer active grants in the principal grant revenue in was from the second year award under our nih grant to further development of our is patch technology for pandemic flu applications  which ended in the second quarter of there was only one other small active grant in the second half of grant revenues in were principally from reimbursable expenses incurred under the first year of our nih grant to further development of our is patch technology for pandemic flu applications  as well as revenues from a cancer grant that ended in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses 
the million increase in research and development expenditures was driven by three major factors associated with supporting our clinical and product development programs increased clinical trial activity  increased development costs for our skin preparation system  and higher payroll costs associated with a increase in headcount and the expensing of stock options 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization costs associated with our pilot manufacturing plant in prior to signing the lease extension for our facility in october  we amortized all leasehold improvements for the facility over the lesser of the useful life or the expiration of the lease term  which was may once we entered into the lease extension  the amortization period for the remaining unamortized leasehold improvements was extended to may general and administrative expenses 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to higher payroll costs associated with expensing stock options  higher insurance  legal  and investor relation costs associated with being a public company  and higher facilities cost associated with leasing additional space in our facility 
interest income expense and other net 
the net interest and other income reflects the interest received on our cash and marketable securities  offset by interest expense on financing to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements  and the amortization income expense associated with the purchase of marketable securities at a discount or premium 
the increase in other income was primarily the result of amortization income associated with securities purchased at a discount after our initial public offering in february net loss 
the million increase in our net loss was principally a result of increased research and development expenses in the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenues costs expenses research development general administrative total costs expenses other expense income net loss revenues 
the slight increase in grant revenues is principally the result of revenues from the nih grant awarded in january for further development of our is patch technology for pandemic flu applications  which was offset by a decline in reimbursable activities in under other grants for our needle free patch programs 
research and development expenses 
the million increase in research expenditures was driven by three major factors associated with supporting our clinical and product development programs increased preclinical study costs as a result of higher charges for services and continuing development of preclinical models  increased depreciation and amortization costs associated with our pilot manufacturing facility  which was put into service in july  and higher payroll costs associated with a increase in headcount and expensing of stock options 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs and contract manufacturing expenses  both of which were higher during as we initiated five clinical trials during general and administrative expenses 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to consulting expenses associated with evaluating potential corporate collaborations  higher legal costs associated with prosecuting our patent portfolio  and higher payroll costs associated with expensing stock options 
interest income expense and other net 
our net interest and other expense was approximately  for  as compared to net interest and other income of approximately  for the net interest and other income reflects the interest received on our cash and marketable securities  offset by interest expense on financing to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements 
the decrease in net interest and other income was a result of lower interest income because of declining cash balances and higher interest expense associated funds borrowed to finance the construction of our pilot manufacturing facility 
net loss 
the million increase in our net loss was principally a result of increased research and development expenses in liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur increasing and significant losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  and expand our operations 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and debt 
we have also generated funds from collaborative partners and research grants 
as of december  we had approximately million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we invest in cash equivalents and us government and agency obligations 
our investment objectives are  primarily  to assure liquidity and preservation of capital and  secondarily  to obtain investment income 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair value  plus any accrued interest 
we have used cash primarily to finance our research operations  including clinical trials 
these costs will be offset by reimbursements from dhhs under our pandemic flu contract  which was awarded in january dhhs has allotted approximately million in the first months of that contract and we expect to be reimbursed for research  development and capital costs associated with the preclinical and clinical testing of the is patch under the contract on a monthly basis 
also  in march  we closed a private placement in our common stock in which we raised approximately million in net proceeds 
we expect that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures and growing operations with our current working capital through the second quarter of in order to fund our needs subsequently  we will need to raise additional money and may seek to do so by out licensing technologies or product candidates to one or more corporate partners  completing an outright sale of assets  securing debt financing  and or selling additional equity securities 
our ability to successfully enter into any such arrangements is uncertain  and  if funds are not available  or not available on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to revise our planned clinical trials  other development activities  capital expenditure requirements  and the scale of our operations 
we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our existing cash balances  however  we may not be able to raise funds or raise amounts sufficient to meet the long term needs of the business 
satisfying long term needs will require the successful commercialization of our product candidates and  at this time  we cannot reliably estimate if or when that will occur 
our future cash requirements include  but are not limited to  supporting our clinical trial efforts and continuing our other research and development programs 
we have entered into various agreements with institutions and clinical research organizations to conduct and monitor our current clinical studies 
under these agreements  subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services  we have estimated our potential payments to be million over the term of currently ongoing studies 
through december   approximately million of this amount has been expensed as research and development expenses and million has been paid related to these clinical studies 
the timing of our expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements are subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institutions of certain services 
the actual amounts we pay out  if any  will depend on a range of factors outside of our control  including the success of our pre clinical and clinical development efforts with respect to any products being developed  the content and timing of decisions made by the fda and other regulatory authorities  and other factors affecting future operating results 
as we expand our clinical studies  we plan to enter into additional agreements 
the following table summarizes sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december  and years ended december  change in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of period the million increase in net cash used in operations was primarily attributable to the increase in net loss from the prior period 
as we develop our technologies and further our clinical trial programs  we expect to increase our spending 
our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval of our products  market acceptance of such products  and our ability to enter into collaborations 
the million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of investing the proceeds from our initial public offering in february for the year ended december   we invested million of our available cash in marketable securities and received proceeds of million from the maturity of such investments  as compared to million of our available cash invested in marketable securities and million received in proceeds from the maturity of such investments for the year ended december  additionally  for the year ended december   we invested approximately million in the purchase of equipment  furniture  and fixtures  for our pilot manufacturing facility and our build out of additional office and laboratory space  as compared to approximately million for such purchases in the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of the million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in february  and from million in net proceeds from a private placement to existing stockholders in october during and  net proceeds from debt borrowings  including landlord leasehold financing  totaled million and million  respectively  as we financed the build out of additional office space and the purchase of additional equipment 
during  we repaid million of our debt  as compared to million during the comparable period in the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total includes interest payable in the period 
these amounts include payments for additional facility space leased under a lease amendment signed in january see discussion of amended lease terms below 
in january  we amended our lease to acquire access to approximately  square feet in the building over the course of first nine months of upon leasing the additional space  we will lease the entire building 
under our existing license agreements  we could be required to pay up to a total of  for each product candidate in milestone payments through product approval  in addition to sales milestones  and royalties on commercial sales  if any occur 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress and costs of preclinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies  our ability to establish  enforce  and maintain collaborations required for product commercialization  the number of product candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our plans to establish sales  marketing  and or manufacturing capabilities  the acquisition of technologies  products  and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development and commercialization of our products 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all terms and conditions of the agreements have been met  including persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for reimbursable cost research grants  we recognize revenue as costs are incurred once the grant funding is authorized 
funding of government grants beyond the us government s current fiscal year is subject to annual congressional appropriations  and the company cannot recognize revenue for subsequent years until the period in which such funding is duly authorized 
provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
research and development costs 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
stock based compensation 
we have four stock based employee compensation plans  described more fully in note to the financial statements  and we record compensation expense based upon the fair value of stock based awards 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the recognition provisions have been applied to all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after january  effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement r  using the modified prospective transition method 
as we have expensed options since  the adoption of statement r did not have a material impact on our stock based compensation expenses for the first quarter of  and management believes that the adoption of statement r will not have a material impact on its financial statements going forward 
we have continued to use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock based awards with the adoption of statement r 
with the adoption of statement r  we recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended december  a one time charge recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which reflects an estimate of forfeitures for unvested awards outstanding as of the adoption of statement r 
this charge represents a reduction in the compensation cost for prior periods for any unvested options remaining that would not have been recognized in those prior periods had forfeitures for such unvested options been estimated during those prior periods 
the cumulative effect for this change in accounting principle totaled  and is recorded on the statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december   we anticipate recognizing approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense  less estimated forfeitures  related to nonvested options under the stock compensation plans in future periods 
these expenses are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
based on the closing price of our stock on december   the intrinsic value of options outstanding as of that date was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
we account for equity instruments issued to nonemployees under the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with  selling  goods and services 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term us government and agency debt securities 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
likewise  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize such market risk  we generally hold these instruments to maturity at which time they are redeemed at their stated or face value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
the interest rates on our debt obligations are fixed so repayment of these obligations is not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
