item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including related notes  appearing elsewhere in the this form k for the year ended december  overview we have developed and manufacture a minimally invasive system based on our proprietary cryoablation technology for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias 
cardiac arrhythmias are dysfunctions in the electrical activity of the heart that normally controls and maintains the highly coordinated contractions of the heart 
arrhythmias cause the heart to pump blood less efficiently  cause potentially debilitating symptoms and can result in life threatening events such as stroke 
we have focused our initial development efforts on designing a system for treating atrial fibrillation  or af  and atrial flutter  or afl  the two most common and difficult to treat arrhythmias 
af is the most prevalent arrhythmia and afl is the second most prevalent arrhythmia and can lead to  and often coexist with  af 
we have filed an application for premarket approval  or pma  with the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of afl with our cryocor cardiac cryoablation system  or cryoablation system 
our pma was filed initially in july in january  we were notified by the fda that the pma was not approvable at that time as the data presented did not meet the fda s chronic effectiveness criteria 
subsequent to receiving the non approvable letter  we reevaluated the chronic effectiveness for each subject treated in the study and after meeting with the fda  we amended our pma for the treatment of afl based on this different analysis of chronic effectiveness 
in this analysis  we computed our chronic effectiveness to be greater than 
we met with the fda in february to discuss the status of their review of our pma amendment and were notified that the fda accepted the process by which our data was analyzed  and that the fda intended to convene an advisory panel meeting to advise the fda on the evaluation of chronic effectiveness in our pma 
in subsequent discussions with the fda  we provided additional information that we believe supports our basis for approval and that has resulted in a higher computation of chronic effectiveness than previously submitted 
the fda decided to postpone the advisory panel meeting for cryocor while they evaluate the additional information and the fda has indicated that it may no longer be necessary to convene an advisory panel meeting 
we anticipate that the fda will render a decision on the approval of our pma by august although we believe our clinical data demonstrate adequate safety and effectiveness to support fda approval  there can be no assurance that our product will be approved by the fda for the treatment of afl 
we are currently enrolling a pivotal trial for the treatment of af  and expect to complete enrollment in our trial in the second quarter of as of march   we need to enroll nine to additional patients to allow us to have the required population of evaluable patients 
we will need to collect safety and effectiveness data on evaluable patients  that have been treated with cryoablation and that have been treated with medical management 
we anticipate needing to enroll between patients to generate the required number of evaluable patients 
in january  the fda approved our request to increase the size of our pivotal trial  as the trial was initially planned to enroll patients 
some patients in our trial withdrew for various reasons  including being randomized to medical management or being denied coverage for the procedure by their insurance company 
we believe our pivotal trial for the treatment of af is significantly further along than any competing ablation catheter trial and we estimate our lead time in enrolling our clinical trial is between months ahead of the enrollment pace of the next most advanced af pivotal trial 
based upon the anticipated timelines for completion of enrollment of our pivotal trial and the time required to follow our patients subsequent to their cryoablation treatments  we anticipate that we will file a pma for the treatment of af in mid and that a decision from the fda on whether or not to approve our cryoablation system for the treatment of af will be received in 
table of contents at present  we are currently selling our products through european distributors  and our products are sold in the united kingdom  germany  denmark  belgium  the netherlands and italy 
we do not intend to expand our current network of distributors 
if we obtain marketing approval from the fda  we plan to commercialize in the united states with a direct cryocor sales force and or with a marketing partner 
due to our limited cash resources  if we are approved for the treatment of afl  we do not intend to broadly commercialize our product in the united states until our financial condition improves 
to date  we have generated minimal revenues and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect these losses to continue as we complete our clinical trial activities and continue to develop our product candidates for potential commercial launch in the united states  and for at least some time after any commercial launch of our product in the united states 
we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock  convertible promissory notes  bank debt  and the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in july  which raised aggregate net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting fees  commissions and offering costs 
financial operations product sales 
our product sales to date have come from a limited number of commercial sites in europe 
to date  we have not generated substantial revenues in europe as our financial resources have primarily been dedicated to product development and clinical trials in the united states 
this has prevented us from providing the resources necessary to broadly market our cryoablation system in europe and from increasing the number of consoles placed in europe 
we believe that european product revenues for companies with new medical technologies typically remain modest until united states product approval is obtained because european approvals  which are designed primarily to demonstrate product safety  are not as compelling for european physician adoption as united states approvals  which must demonstrate effectiveness as well as safety 
we do not expect to generate revenues in the united states unless  and until  our cryoablation system has been approved by the fda and we initiate the sales of our products 
we expect that any revenues we generate from sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  including non cash share based compensation  costs associated with clinical trials  pre clinical activities  regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses  fees paid to external service providers and fees paid under contracts with research organizations  which conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and non cash share based compensation for executive  finance and administrative personnel 
other significant costs include professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property related to our cryoablation system 
results of operations we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  such as the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions  and quarterly variations in sales activities and results 
due to these uncertainties  results of future operations are difficult to predict 
years ended december   and product sales 
our product sales were  in   in and  in these revenues were generated from the sale of our products in europe 
as of december   we had  of 
table of contents deferred revenue related to product shipped to european customers that has not yet met our revenue recognition criteria 
the  or  decrease in product sales from to was due to the closure of our european subsidiary and our decision to sell products only through our network of distributors  which is at a reduced margin than selling products directly 
the  or increase in product sales  from to was due to increased catheter orders from our distributors and medical centers in europe 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales was million in  million in and million in cost of sales primarily consists of materials  labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
the decrease in cost of sales from to was related to lower headcount costs due to our staff restructuring in march as well as reduced sales volumes in if our products are approved by the fda and are successfully commercialized  we anticipate that our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues will decline as we achieve higher future volumes of product sales 
included in cost of sales for the years ended december   and were non cash share based compensation of   and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the million  or  decrease from to was primarily due to slower patient enrollment in versus for the af pivotal trial as well as costs incurred in associated with the filing of our pma for atrial flutter 
the  decrease from to was primarily due to lower payroll costs and lower clinical trial costs related to our af pivotal trial as compared to higher costs incurred in associated with our fully enrolled afl pivotal trial 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non cash share based compensation expenses of  included in research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were non cash share based compensation of   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the  or  increase from to was primarily due to an increase in non cash share based compensation of  the million  or  increase from to was primarily due to an increase in non cash share based compensation of  an increase of  in other compensation related costs and  in increased costs associated with being a public company  which are primarily legal  accounting and insurance costs 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were non cash share based compensation of million  million and  respectively 
interest income 
our interest income was million in   in and  in the fluctuation in interest income directly relates to the balance of short term investments throughout those years 
the short term investment balance was affected by our mid year initial public offering in and our private equity placement in interest expense 
our interest expense was million in  million in and  in our and interest expense includes  and  respectively  related to our million debt facility 
in addition  our and interest expense also included  and  respectively  in non cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount recorded on warrants issued in march in  we incurred  of interest expense related to a term loan issued in mid that was paid off in march  as well as interest expense on capital leases 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in august as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations to date from private placements of equity and debt securities for aggregate net cash proceeds of million through december   as well as bank debt and the proceeds of our initial public offering  which was closed in july and raised aggregate net 
table of contents proceeds of million after deducting underwriting expenses and commissions and offering costs 
concurrent with the closing of the initial public offering  all of our outstanding preferred shares converted into shares of common stock 
the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm included in this annual report on form k contains an unqualified opinion with an explanatory paragraph  to the effect that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
this opinion could itself have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding  short term debt outstanding of million excluding a debt discount for warrants of  working capital of million and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
we currently invest our cash in money market funds  united states government or corporate bond securities and asset backed securities 
in march  we entered into a debt facility and borrowed million thereunder 
as part of that transaction  we repaid in full an outstanding term loan of million 
the new debt facility bears interest at a rate of per year and requires interest only payments through june  at which time the principal is due and payable 
based upon our current planned level of expenditures  we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering  together with cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to permit us to repay our outstanding debt facility in june and to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital until december net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash used in both of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for each period  offset in part by depreciation and amortization  non cash share based compensation  amortization of debt discount and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million used in investing activities for the year ended december  cash provided by used in investing activities relates to purchases and maturities of short term investments as well as purchases and disposals of property and equipment 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  is related to proceeds from the sales of short term investments versus the purchases of short term investments subsequent to our july initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our initial public offering which had net proceeds of million as well as borrowing under our new debt facility of million  offset by the pay off of an existing term loan and payments on existing capital leases 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have had limited commercial sales in europe  no commercial sales in the united states  and we have not yet achieved profitability 
we do not currently have any products approved for sale in the united states 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our products  continue our clinical programs  expand our corporate infrastructure and prepare for the potential commercial launch of our cryoablation system in the united states 
we expect that we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability 

table of contents we do not expect to generate significant product revenues until we obtain marketing approval for and begin selling our cryoablation system in the united states 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering  together with cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to permit us to repay our outstanding debt facility in june and to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital until december we will need to seek additional financing and we expect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility to increase our financial resources 
the sale of additional equity and convertible debt securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities  these securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned clinical and commercial activities  and research and development efforts  or to cease operations 
on february   we issued a press release announcing that we implemented a restructuring plan intended to reduce our burn rate and to permit us to finance ourselves with our then existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments until december the decision to implement a restructuring plan was in response to the communication that we received from the fda informing us that our pma for the treatment of afl using our cryoablation system was not approvable based on the data we submitted 
our board of directors approved the restructuring plan on february  the restructuring plan included a reduction in our workforce by approximately one third  and postponement of some r d programs  with possible elimination of others 
the reduction in our workforce resulted in severance related costs of  including benefits 
we also incurred  in restructuring expense associated with terminating various sales and marketing associated contracts 
in total  we incurred  in costs associated with the restructuring plan  which was completed during july in august  we created an incentive compensation program for our non executive full time employees 
under the terms of the program  employees that remain with the company through august  will receive a payment of of their annual salary 
the incentive payments will be paid in september and could total approximately  if all employees eligible for the program remain through august  additionally  at the end of august  we did not extend our employment agreement with our former chief executive officer  gregory ayers 
under the terms of his employment agreement  he will receive separation compensation of one year s salary  or  over the months subsequent to his departure 
this amount has been accrued on the balance sheet as of december  and will be paid during at present  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in cologne  germany that previously sold our products in germany  belgium  and the netherlands 
we discontinued the activities of this subsidiary in  and are currently pursuing the dissolution of this subsidiary 
we incurred restructuring charges of  in conjunction with the closing of our subsidiary  of which  remains accrued at december  we have signed distribution agreements for the sale of our cryoablation system in the united kingdom and italy  and our united kingdom distributor supports our customers in germany  belgium  denmark and the netherlands 
at present  we do not currently expect to sign additional distribution agreements in europe 
if we obtain marketing approval from the fda  we plan to commercialize in the united states with our own sales force or in combination with a marketing partner 
we anticipate spending at least million in external costs during and for clinical trials and regulatory activities related to using our cryoablation system to treat afl and af  and an anticipated clinical trial 
table of contents for our next generation catheter  quantum 
we believe the total costs for our clinical trials for afl and af and the development of our existing product candidates will require approximately million during and  with our remaining cash and cash equivalents being used to prosecute and maintain our intellectual property portfolio  to fund our facility  manufacturing and quality system operations and to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements during this same period 
we have filed requests with the uspto seeking to invoke interference proceedings involving two patents owned by cryocath technologies  inc and two of our patent applications to determine who first invented certain primary and pre cooling refrigeration system designs and certain heat exchanger designs 
during  the uspto agreed to reissue a patent licensed from cryogen that we consider to be important to our efforts to invoke interference proceedings 
to date  the uspto has not invoked interference proceedings 
if interference proceedings are invoked and we are not successful in these proceedings  we could fail to get rights to certain patent claims 
although we do not believe this finding would be material to our ability to operate  we believe an award of these rights to us may have a material effect on cryocath s ability to compete with us in the united states 
we may incur substantial costs in pursuit of these proceedings 
our forecasts of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to complete development of products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this form k  and in our other securities filings filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to obtain fda approval or other regulatory approval for our products  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals  including participation in fda advisory panel meetings  clinical trial results  acceptance by the fda of our clinical trial design and data to support applications for marketing approval of the desired indications  the costs of filing  prosecuting  and maintaining our owned and licensed patent applications and patents  and defending and enforcing these patents and other intellectual property rights  the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the extent and level of reimbursement for cryoablation  the commercial acceptance of our product following the initiation of our sales efforts in the united states  the effect of competing products and technologies  and the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish 
future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies  but we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table summarized our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  payments due in total less than year years years more than years operating leases debt facility the table above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
our commitments for operating leases primarily relate to the lease for our headquarters in san diego  california 
in november  we renewed this lease through september  and the table above includes the payments of approximately  per month that will be due pursuant to the terms of the lease 
at december   we had purchase commitments outstanding totaling  for console materials   in deposits on console inventory components  and  in console inventory which is recorded within inventory on our balance sheet 
this total inventory represents approximately nine consoles in finished goods  components to build an additional ten complete consoles  and components that could be used in the production of additional consoles 
these materials are not expected to be obsolete in the time period anticipated for commercialization 
at december   we had disposables inventory totaling  of which  is raw materials 
this inventory level represents approximately  finished catheters 
we anticipate that the existing inventory levels  including the open purchase commitments  will be needed in either or to the extent we are able to commercialize our products in the united states 
we also have service agreements with clinical sites  individuals and institutional research organizations for the conduct of our af pivotal trial 
we make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the actual number of patients enrolled and the period of follow up in the trials  and we have accrued approximately  in fees and expenses through december  payable in connection with our af pivotal trial 
we do not have minimum payment obligations under these agreements and the amount to be paid to each center and the timing of those payments will vary based on the negotiated amount paid for each patient to be treated and for each patient screened who fails to or declines to participate in the clinical trial 
we anticipate that the external cash outlay of completing our af pivotal trial and submitting a pma for the treatment of af with our cryoablation system will be approximately million during and however  due to the variability associated with these agreements and the timing of patient enrollment  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future patient enrollment costs we will incur 
we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with the preparation of our regulatory filings  including costs associated with employees and consultants and related legal expenses 
we have agreed to cover the treatment costs for certain patients in our af pivotal trial who are either not insured  or who are insured but were declined coverage by their insurance company for the costs associated with this procedure 
as of december   we have agreed to cover the treatment costs for one patient  at an estimated cost of approximately  we anticipate that there may be additional patients for whom we agree to pay the treatment costs  and project that the total number of patients for which we could cover the cost of the treatment could be between patients  at an estimated cost of  each  the total cost for which is included in our estimated total payments during and of million 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we comply with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sab and sfas set forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment terms and ability to return products 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is reasonably assured  and v the ability to return the product has expired 
historically  customers had the right to return products until one month following the expiration date of the product  which had been six months after its production 
effective october   our products now expire one year after production and we modified our return policy such that we will no longer grant a right to return products upon expiration of their one year product life 
as we have had limited sales of our products  we currently recognize revenues when the customer has paid for the product and  if applicable  the right of return  if any  has expired 
if our products are approved by the fda for sale in the united states and if they gain market acceptance and our sales volumes increase  we will continue to monitor our shipments  returns  maintenance costs and bad debts 
eventually  we anticipate recording revenues upon shipment  accruing estimated warranty costs and estimated returns as a reduction of revenue upon shipment and accruing bad debts as a selling  general and administrative cost 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses and include fees paid to participating hospitals and other service providers which conduct clinical trial activities with patients on our behalf 
the various costs of the trial are contractually based on the nature of the service and we accrue the costs as the services to the patient are provided 
share based payments we have four share based compensation plans consisting of three stock option programs and an employee stock purchase plan 
prior to january   we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related guidance  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  as interpreted by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  using the prospective method and the modified prospective method 
therefore  we have not restated our financial results for prior periods 

table of contents in accordance with sfas r  we utilized the prospective method for stock options granted prior to our initial public offering as we had used the minimum value method of measuring the fair value of these options for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas therefore  unless modified in the future  these options are excluded from the adoption of sfas r 
we utilized the modified prospective method for stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering as we had used the fair value based method of measuring the fair value of these options for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas under these transition methods  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december  included the following a share based compensation cost associated with options granted prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices less than the deemed fair value of the common stock at the date of grant  b compensation cost related to any share based payments granted subsequent to the date of our initial public offering through  but not vested as of  december   and c compensation cost for any share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
during and the first half of  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  stock options were granted at exercise prices that were below the deemed fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  deferred stock compensation was recorded into stockholders equity during and in accordance with apb the deferred stock compensation was being amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards  which is generally four years 
in accordance with sfas r  we eliminated the balance of deferred compensation against paid in capital on the date of adoption of sfas r but  as noted above  continue to recognize the related compensation expense in the statement of operations 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recognized additional share based employee compensation expense of  during the year ended december  in addition to million in compensation expense recorded as required under apb we calculated this expense based on the fair values of the share based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes option valuation model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions about expected future volatility of our stock price and the expected term of the options that we grant 
calculating share based compensation expense under sfas r also requires us to make assumptions about expected future forfeiture rates for our option awards 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements already granted under our various plans was million  which we expect will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
however  it is difficult to predict the actual amount of share based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods because that expense can be affected by changes in the amount or terms of our share based compensation awards issued in the future  changes in the assumptions used in our model to value those future awards  changes in our stock price  and changes in interest rates  among other factors 
we issue stock options to non employees  generally for services  which we account for under the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force abstract no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
these stock options are valued using the black scholes option valuation model and are subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying options vest 
changes in fair value are amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
inventory as of december   we had raw materials  work in process and finished goods console inventory totaling  in addition  we had open purchase commitments totaling  for console components ordered that will be received and paid for during as well as  in deposits on console inventory components 
this total inventory represents approximately nine consoles in finished goods  components to build an additional ten complete consoles  and raw materials that could be used in the production of additional consoles 
further  at december   we had disposables inventory totaling  of which  is raw materials 
this inventory level represents approximately  finished catheters 
we evaluated whether these levels of console and catheter inventory was excessive based upon the january communication from 
table of contents the fda indicating that our cryoablation system was not approvable at that time for the treatment of afl 
we concluded that the existing inventory levels  including the open purchase commitments  were not excessive for the following reasons consoles completed consoles can be deployed in europe where our product has been approved for sale  we expect to need between to consoles to effectively commercialize our product in the united states  we believe we will receive approval to sell our product in the united states in either  or  and the console is not subject to obsolescence in the time period contemplated for commercialization 
disposables we anticipate the sale of approximately catheters in europe during  we believe we will receive approval to sell our product in the united states in either  or  and the catheter raw materials are not subject to obsolescence in the time period contemplated for commercialization 
based on the above  we concluded that no reserves were needed at december  for either the existing console and catheter inventory or the materials on order  to be delivered in we will continue to evaluate these inventory levels based on the progress of our trials and regulatory approvals 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we are required to adopt it in we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  included liquid money market accounts  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk 
we have some activities in foreign currencies  principally our commercial efforts in europe  which are denominated in euros 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
however  we do not expect fluctuations in foreign exchange rates to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
