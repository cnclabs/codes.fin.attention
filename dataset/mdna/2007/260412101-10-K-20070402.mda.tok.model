we sell our products through a multi channel strategy  including catalogs  the internet and retail stores 
this multi channel strategy has allowed us to use catalogs and our proprietary database of nearly two million names of equestrian enthusiasts as a primary marketing tool to increase catalog sales and to drive additional business to our e commerce websites and retail stores 
we offer a comprehensive selection of products required to own  train and compete with a horse  selling from under to over  our products fall into the following three main categories saddles and tack  specialized apparel  and horse care and stable products

we offer what we believe is the largest selection of exclusive and semi exclusive equestrian products in the industry 
to further broaden our offerings  we began selling into the western style riding market in under the smith brothers name 
our management team is highly experienced in both the direct marketing and retail channels with an average of more than years of equestrian experience 
since stephen day acquired an ownership interest in dover and joined as our president and chief executive officer  he and the rest of the management team have grown annual revenues from million to million from through prior to joining dover  mr 
day was responsible for building the only other national english style equestrian products direct marketing and retail company  state line tack 
we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the synergies of combining catalog and internet operations with a retail store channel 
by marketing our products across integrated  multiple shopping channels  we have strengthened our brand visibility and brand equity  expanded our customer database and increased revenues  profits and market share 
while our catalog has been our primary 
table of contents marketing vehicle to increase internet and store traffic  each of our channels has reinforced the other and generates additional customers 
through our subsidiaries  we currently operate eight retail stores under the dover saddlery name and one retail store under the smith brothers name 
we have identified additional market locations throughout the us  which we believe are attractive for our planned retail store expansion and can allow us to capitalize on the highly fragmented nature of the retail equestrian products market and to take advantage of our strong brand name recognition 
these additional locations have been identified using our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which selects the locations nationwide with the strongest potential and optimizes distances between stores to enhance revenue potential 
our initial targets are based on an optimization model of locations  each utilizing one of three different store formats  depending on the location and revenue potential of the area 
we believe that our proprietary mathematical store optimization model assists us in locating potential retail sites and gives us a competitive advantage in finding optimal new store locations 
based on our experience to date with opening new retail stores in areas where we have a high level of existing direct customers  as well as the experience of other multi channel retailers  we believe that expanding the number of retail store locations and focusing on our multi channel business strategy are keys to our continued success 
our mission is to grow our business by providing the most comprehensive offering of the highest quality  broadest range and most technically advanced equestrian tack  specialized apparel  horse care and stable products to serious equestrians  with a profitable and efficient operating model

we believe that we have numerous competitive strengths  including experienced management with a track record of growth and profitability we were founded in and have a year operating history 
stephen day joined dover after successfully building and growing another equestrian products catalog and retailer  state line tack

since stephen day became president and chief executive officer in  we have been profitable and have grown annual revenues from million to million 
established brand in english style riding equipment and apparel we are known for offering the highest quality products  the most comprehensive selection and excellent customer service 
since our founding over years ago  we have built a reputation with a large and growing following in the equestrian products marketplace 
dover saddlery is one of only two large nationally recognized retail brands in the english style equestrian products industry  and we believe our dover saddlery brand is a significant asset as we continue our retail store expansion and multi channel growth strategy 
leading english style equestrian products direct marketer with million in revenues from our direct sales channel  we believe we hold the largest market share among equestrian products catalogers for equestrian tack  specialized apparel  horse care and stable products 
the dover saddlery catalog is known by many customers as a leading source for english style equestrian products and the smith brothers catalog is becoming a strong force in the western style riding market 
as the largest direct marketer in the us in the equestrian products industry  our leading position sets us apart from other retailers 
large  detailed customer database we believe that our proprietary database is one of the largest and most detailed in the industry 
the database contains customers who have purchased from us over the last years  including detailed purchasing history over the last years and demographic information of such customers  and the names and addresses of individuals who have requested our catalogs  as well as other individuals with equestrian interests 
this is a key competitive advantage and business planning tool 
it is also a barrier to entry since it could take years and could be very costly to duplicate 
successful multi channel strategy our multi channel strategy of using catalog  internet and retail store sales channels has enabled us to capture customer data  achieve operational synergies  provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers  cross market our products and reinforce our brand across channels 
through our sophisticated customer database  we have observed that multi channel customers have bought  on average  nearly three times more products per year than single channel customers 
our success in our hockessin  de store and our initial results from our more recently opened plaistow  nh store support our belief that an expanded retail presence is an attractive growth opportunity for us 
excellent customer service our company wide focus on exceptional customer service is integral to our success 
we promote a culture of prompt  knowledgeable and courteous service and strive for a consistent customer experience across all channels of purchase 
over of our customer service and sales representatives are horse enthusiasts 
additionally  our representatives receive ongoing product training from merchandise suppliers and internal product specialists 
we also have a policy of offering customers a satisfaction guarantee 
we believe that our well trained  knowledgeable staff and our historical ability to fill approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days from our in stock inventory are some of the reasons why we have had historically low return rates and high repeat customer rates 

table of contents attractive customer demographics dover saddlery customers are primarily affluent females with a passion for the english style riding sport 
we believe them to be discerning  luxury oriented customers who often choose to buy from us because of the high quality offering and prestige of owning the premier brands 
based on demographic data available to us  we believe that more than two thirds of households that own horses have incomes above the national median household income of  our customer base has been very loyal as demonstrated by high repurchase rates 
significant barriers to entry we enjoy significant barriers to entry including substantial costs of developing a useful customer database  efficient merchandising and fulfillment infrastructure  breadth of product offering and in stock inventory levels  as well as the costs and time involved in building customer trust and brand recognition 
the investments we have made in our brand  our customer and proprietary mathematical store optimization model and inventory replenishment set us apart from others in the industry 
highly fragmented equestrian products market the current marketplace for equestrian products is highly fragmented and mostly consists of small  one location tack shops 
there are approximately  different retailers in the us selling equestrian products 
although there are a number of places to find equestrian products  there are no large companies focused on the english style equestrian products market with any significant number of retail store locations with the exception of state line tack  which has recently announced the closing of its retail operations 
we bring a level of merchandising  marketing  on hand inventory and operational discipline that is unique in the industry 
broad and distinctive selection of high quality  need based products at competitive prices with rapid order fulfillment capability we have feature rich  need based  functional offerings encompassing virtually every product necessary to own  train and compete with a horse 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition by our vast breadth and depth of inventory 
we offer products ranging from entry level price points to the premium high end 
we carry premium brands  private label and non branded products to meet the broad range of customer expectations and needs 
because a percentage of our products are characterized as need based for the continued care of a horse  we believe that this contributes to a high degree of predictable buying patterns by our customers 
in addition to this  approximately of our products are non obsolescent items 
our large inventory has allowed us to ship approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days 
we are also able to ship any product we offer to our retail stores within an average of business days  effectively increasing our retail store inventory to match that of our littleton  ma warehouse 
this provides our customers with the ability to walk into any of our retail stores and access our entire product offering 
competitors who maintain only one or even a few stores are unable to match the breadth  depth and ready availability of our million in total inventory 
growth strategies having established ourselves as the largest direct marketer in the equestrian products market  we are continuing our strategy to capitalize on our strong brand equity  take advantage of our comprehensive customer database  achieve operational synergies  cross market products and provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience across channels 
we have observed that our multi channel customers have bought  on average  nearly three times more product per year than single channel customers  and therefore a multi channel model is a key part of our strategy to grow our revenues  profits and market share 
our growth strategy includes several key components 
open dover saddlery retail stores in targeted locations we currently operate nine retail stores  with eight targeted at the english style riding segment  and one under the smith brothers name targeted at the western style riding segment 
the equestrian products market is estimated at billion  yet no national  equestrian products specialty retail chains exist and there are only a 
table of contents limited number of small  regional  multi unit english equestrian products retailers 
state line tack  which operates as a store within a store in selected petsmart locations  and has been the only retailer of size  has recently announced the closing of its retail operations 
we have identified initial locations throughout the us  which we believe are attractive for our initial retail store expansion and will allow us to capitalize on the highly fragmented nature of the retail equestrian products market and our strong brand name recognition 
these locations have been identified using our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which selects the locations nationwide with the strongest potential and optimizes distances between stores to enhance revenue potential 
the model optimizes distances between stores with concentrations of current customers and recalibrates when actual stores are targeted and added 
our direct marketing operations have provided detailed customer data regarding location and sales performance that has given us the ability to plan and perform extensive site analysis 
our initial targets are based on an optimization model of locations  each utilizing one of three different store formats  depending on the location and revenue potential of the area 
we believe that our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  which assists us in locating retail sites  should give us a competitive advantage in finding attractive locations 
expand our direct sales channel our catalog business drives traffic to our internet and retail store channels 
we typically mail over million catalogs a year and had nearly million unique visitors based on unique daily visits on our websites 
we plan to expand our direct sales business through initiatives to existing and new customers 
we seek to increase the number of customers and prospects that receive a catalog  increase the numbers of customers buying through our catalog or other channels  and increase the amount each customer spends for our merchandise through the continued introduction of new products 
we plan to continue to utilize web based opportunities with promotional  targeted e mails programs  refer a friend programs and on line search engines 
we intend to continue our practices of using banner advertising on qualified equestrian web sites  of having links to and from qualified equestrian web sites  and of sending prospect e mails to qualified equestrian e mail lists 
enhance our product mix we carry premium branded  private label and non branded equipment and accessories 
we believe we have the largest collection of exclusive and semi exclusive brands in the industry 
we continually seek to expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and will seek to expand and enhance our product mix to increase revenues and the profitability of the business 
currently we offer a broad selection of products under the dover and other trademarks 
we believe that these products offer a great value to our customers who have come to trust our quality 
expand further in the western style equestrian products market while it is difficult to track industry data  the number of western style riders is believed to be at least four times the number of english style riders in the us we entered the western style equestrian products market through our acquisition of smith brothers in and opened a smith brothers retail store in we intend to expand our direct marketing and  eventually  our retail store presence in western style riding 
accomplishments in pursuit of our goal to be the largest direct equestrian retailer  we accomplished the following in we acquired dominion saddlery with retail store locations in the vital maryland virginia equestrian market we opened a new location in hunt valley  maryland just north of baltimore in september we remodeled and expanded dominion s crofton  maryland location and reopened it as a dover saddlery location in december 
table of contents we were selected as one of the top retail internet websites by internet retailer magazine we opened a new miller s harness website to support the miller s harness sales flyer we introduced the new elite version of the dover catalog which presents an expanded product selection of the finest english riding tack and apparel industry equestrian products market the north american market for equestrian tack  saddles  specialized apparel  grooming and healthcare products  horse clothing  equestrian related media and other horse supplies is estimated by the american horse council at billion for although studies on the equestrian industry are informal  according to the fountain agricounsel usa horse industry business report  in  the total industry sales for the markets we target were billion 
a american horse council survey estimated that there are million horses in the us according to american sports data  over of the us population  or million people  ride horses with an average of participating days per year  which exceeds participation in other popular outdoor sports  such as downhill skiing at and days and mountain biking at and days 
there are many indicators that point to the continued growth of the equestrian products industry 
a study by nfo research indicated that of us households are involved in riding  an additional were involved at one time and would like to become involved 
there has also been a recent increase in the number of nationally televised programs dedicated exclusively to the equestrian viewer  such as nbc s presentation of the rolex international day event held in lexington  kentucky and horsecity 
com tv 
the equestrian media network has also been gaining traction with national television stations  which is expected to help increase the popularity of the equestrian products industry even further 
there are very few dominant manufacturers and distributors  and no dominant retailers in the equestrian products industry  creating a highly fragmented market 
of the approximately  us equestrian products retailers  we believe that a majority of them are too small to develop multiple sales channels  deep inventories  automated inventory control systems  extensive customer databases and brand equity  and are therefore unable to effectively control a significant portion of market share 
direct marketing direct marketing is a fast growing  dynamic industry that includes sales generated through direct mail and the internet 
sales generated through catalogs  both offline and on the internet  have grown at an annual rate of since total sales attributed to catalogs in the us reached billion in  and the direct marketing association dma projects they will grow to over billion by the dma projects annual growth of sales attributed to catalogs of  which will continue to outpace the overall projected retail sales growth of 
sales from catalog retailing grew rapidly during the s at an annual rate of approximately twice the rate of conventional retailing 
this growth was driven by several factors  including the emergence of strong direct marketing brands eg  dell computer  lands end  and ll bean  consumers busier lifestyles  due in part to the substantial increase in the number of professional women  and the recent introduction of specialty catalogs tailored to niche audiences combined with more sophisticated mailing and customer targeting techniques 

table of contents established catalogers enjoy significant barriers to entry including substantial costs of developing useful customer databases  efficient merchandising and fulfillment infrastructure and consumer trust and brand recognition 
the expense of acquiring  perfecting and maintaining an extensive and accurate customer database specific to each company s target market is expensive  and such a database can take years to build to levels competitive with established catalogs 
the internet is a key driver of growing direct marketing sales 
industry research estimates that online sales in the us reached billion in this was an increase of from as the price of personal computing declines and americans become more technologically savvy  many are choosing to browse and buy over the internet 
moreover  an increasing number of internet users are turning to broadband service that allows faster  more convenient access to online shopping 
online retail sales are projected to grow from to  accounting for of total us retail sales by we believe that a large  highly fragmented industry with affluent  passionate horse enthusiasts presents us with the opportunity to use our reputation and multi channel strategy to increase our market share and revenues in the future 
customers our english riding customers are primarily affluent females with a passion for the english riding sport 
we believe them to be discerning  luxury oriented customers who often choose to buy from us because of the high quality offering and prestige of owning the premier brands 
based on demographic data from the american horse council ahc  we believe that more than two thirds of households that own horses have incomes above the national median household income of  as reported by the us census 
our customer database provides for each customer a summary of the recency  frequency and monetary value of that customer s orders as well as a detailed listing of each item the customer has ordered for the past five years 
our customers have been very loyal as demonstrated by high repurchase rates 
our multi channel strategy having established ourselves as the largest direct marketer of equestrian tack  specialized apparel  horse care and stable products in the us  we plan to continue our multi channel retail strategy to capitalize on our strong brand equity and utilize our customer database 
this multi channel strategy enables us to capture customer data  achieve operational synergies  provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers  cross market our products and reinforce our brand across channels 
we believe that our strategy is working 
through the data captured by our sophisticated customer database  we have determined that multi channel customers buy  on average  nearly three times more product per year than customers who only purchase through a single channel 
this is supported by the experiences of other successful multi channel retailers such as eddie bauer and jc penney 
eddie bauer s multi channel customers spend  on average  approximately six times more than its single channel customers and jc penney s multi channel customers spend  on average  approximately five times more than its single channel customers 
our multi channel business model has several key elements our catalogs are targeted marketing tools which we use to generate customers  gather customer demographic data  increase the visibility of the dover saddlery and smith brothers brands  increase visits to the internet and drive traffic to our retail stores  utilize our large  information rich customer database to cross market our products  prospect for customers  forecast sales  manage inventory  tailor catalog mailings and plan for our retail store expansion  and 
table of contents use our proprietary mathematical store optimization model to target the strongest markets nationwide and optimize store spacing for our retail location selection 
based on the latest customer data and actual store openings  our proprietary software maps out the entire country with our catalog sales and extrapolates ideal locations for our stores such that we can capture the greatest density of potential customers 
the model is dynamic such that any change in a single location or number of total locations will impact site selection and estimated performance system wide 
based on research of other similar multi channel concepts  we believe that  when mature  the natural channel balance of a multi channel retailer tends to stabilize with to of the sales coming from the retail store channel 
this retail purchasing preference on the part of consumers is even more pronounced in the equestrian industry 
research by frank n 
magid associates  inc indicates that of tack customers shop at retail stores 
since we currently have just under of our total revenues coming from retail stores  we believe that there is significant opportunity to continue to develop our multi channel strategy and pursue our targeted retail store expansion 
see retail store operations and expansion 
our experience from the hockessin  de store has shown that within two years of opening  direct sales from customers within a mile radius of this store exceeded levels prior to its opening and led to sales of approximately compounded annual growth over the first two years of operation 
although our wellesley  ma store has been in operation for over years  we have maintained an impressive mix of both direct and retail store sales in the area 
the direct sales in the area surrounding the store demonstrate that even though we have a retail location  the convenience of multi channel shopping over the internet or by catalog has been appealing to our customers located within miles of the store 
we believe that this provides further support to the potential value created by opening up retail stores in areas that already have a strong customer base 
we seek to continually improve our operating efficiencies across our multiple channels through our integrated planning  order management  fulfillment systems and economies of scale in cross channel inventory processing and advertising 
we continuously strive to enhance our efficiencies to provide a seamless cross channel experience to our customers  and achieve greater profitability 
direct sales channel since we mailed our first catalog in  we have grown our direct sales channel to include three separate catalogs and three e commerce websites 
as we implement our plan to expand our retail stores  we expect the revenues generated from the retail stores to comprise a greater percentage and eventually a majority of our revenues 
however  the direct sales channel will continue to be the core component of our brand identity and the driving force behind the customer data utilized to promote each of our sales channels 
our direct sales channel generated approximately million in revenues in or of our total revenues 
of this amount  we generated approximately million in revenues from internet orders  or of our total 
our proprietary database contains nearly two million names 
we expect this database to continue to grow as we open additional retail locations 
catalog we mail our catalogs to individuals who have made purchases during the past five years 
we also mail catalogs to new prospects obtained through our proprietary database of names we have compiled through sponsorships  trade associations  subscriber lists for equestrian publications  grassroots name gathering efforts  and outside rented lists 

table of contents we currently maintain two primary catalogs and a sales flier 
the dover saddlery catalog caters to the mid to high end english style equestrian products customer 
the smith brothers catalog is aimed at the western style equestrian products customer 
the miller s harness sales flier is used to reach the entry level and lower cost english style equestrian products customer 
catalogs are sent regularly throughout the year to a carefully selected circulation list 
we develop annually four distinct dover saddlery catalogs and four distinct smith brothers catalogs including a large annual catalog for each line 
within the dover saddlery annual catalog  we produce three riding discipline editions  including one each targeting the dressage  hunter jumper and eventing segments and one general edition of the dover saddlery catalog 
each of these catalogs share core pages  but are modified to target each of the specific customer segments 
dover saddlery we expanded the annual dover saddlery catalog from pages in to pages in it is the most comprehensive source for the english style equestrian products market 
in addition to the general catalog  the three targeted editions of the dover saddlery annual catalog specialize in the dressage  eventing and hunter jumper segments 
dressage

at the highest level  these riders compete in grand prix jumping events  for prize money of up to  per event 
smith brothers the annual catalog for smith brothers is positioned as the premier catalog for the western horseman 
at pages  it is one of the more comprehensive offerings in the western style equestrian products market 
we offer one general edition and three targeted editions of the smith brothers annual catalog 
the targeted editions specialize in the competitive roping  barrel racing and show riding segments 
competitive roping

table of contents internet in july of  we launched our website  www 
doversaddlery 
com 
in february  we acquired the smith brothers website  www 
smithbrothers 
com 
our internet revenues have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of from  our first full year of internet operations  to and were approximately million or of total revenues in our websites are integral to our multi channel strategy 
the websites reinforce our relationship with current catalog customers and are a growing source of new customers 
new customers acquired through the websites have historically been highly responsive to subsequent catalog mailings 
our websites feature our entire product offering and enable us to better market to our customers and visitors by allowing different pages to be automatically shown to different types of individuals 
this allows us to segment visitors into smaller  targeted groups  which in turn increases conversion rates 
visitors are able to shop by their riding style  providing them with images of their passion and products suited to their niche 
we plan to continue to utilize web based opportunities with promotional  targeted e mails programs  refer a friend programs  and on line search engines 
we intend to continue using banner advertising on qualified equestrian web sites  providing links to and from qualified equestrian web sites  and of sending prospect e mails to qualified equestrian e mail lists 
retail store operations and expansion we currently operate eight stores under the dover saddlery name and one store under the smith brothers brand 
we intend to expand our retail store operations going forward  primarily under the dover saddlery brand 
retail store locations dover saddlery and dominion stores wellesley  ma hockessin  de plaistow  nh hunt valley  md chantilly  va crofton  md charlottesville  va lexington  va smith brothers denton  tx our retail stores carry largely the same product mix as our catalogs and websites to promote convenience and shopping frequency 
the broad selection of retail product and the ready availability of inventory from our warehouse allow for superior customer service 
to the extent that a certain item is not physically available at a retail store  store personnel will work with the customer to ensure prompt in store or home delivery of the item  according to the customer s preference 
each store s mission is to foster loyalty and provide face to face answers to customers questions 
sales staff are carefully selected and trained to provide accurate and helpful product information to the customer 
in most cases  they are experienced equestrians 

table of contents new retail store model our proprietary mathematical store optimization model will help us select each store location by projecting sales based on real time catalog customer purchases surrounding the potential location 
our initial targeted locations will be positioned in key markets exhibiting the highest concentration of current direct sales customers and equestrian enthusiasts 
existing customers within the proposed locations are expected to support and accelerate the maturation curve of new stores 
prior experience with existing stores has demonstrated an increase in the number of catalog customers within stores trade areas 
dover store prototype we are developing three primary prototype store models for nationwide rollout a  b  and c 
our a store model contains approximately  to  square feet and assumes an average initial net investment of approximately million  including approximately  of pre opening costs and  of inventory 
a  to  square foot b store model assumes an initial investment of approximately million  including approximately  in pre opening expenses and  in inventory  and is projected to generate approximately the same level of sales per square foot as the a store model 
a c store model is currently in development and will be targeted to be a smaller footprint of approximately  square feet  filling in key markets as appropriate 
new stores may be established in existing leased space or newly constructed facilities 
our new construction stores have been designed in conjunction with morton buildings  a nationwide builder of upscale barns 
the economical design incorporates a clear span wood truss that allows the interior space to be completely open 
once inside the store  a post and beam loft structure around the edges will create a hayloft environment for the saddle shop and other destination products 
the hayloft in our a stores will add up to  square feet of selling space 
site optimization we have developed a proprietary mathematical store optimization model to select locations for new stores 
the model continuously optimizes distances between stores within concentrations of current customers and equestrian enthusiasts and recalibrates  as necessary  when actual stores are targeted and added 
our direct sales operations and proprietary database provide detailed customer data regarding location and sales performance  which give us a significant competitive advantage over other traditional equestrian products retailers 
this data  combined with our proprietary mathematical store optimization model  helps us accurately and effectively identify markets and target specific locations that maximize potential revenue out of selected markets 
once we identify an optimal location by zip code  extensive site analysis follows  including major highway access and real estate considerations  to enhance the profitability potential for our stores 
marketing our dover saddlery and smith brothers catalogs are our primary branding and advertising vehicles 
we believe our catalogs reinforce our brand image and drive sales in all of our sales channels 
our direct sales channel enables us to maintain a database of customer sales patterns and thus target segments of our customer base with specific marketing 
our customer database provides for each customer a summary of the recency  frequency and monetary value of that customer s orders as well as a detailed listing of each item the customer has ordered over the past five years 
depending on the spending habits we identify through our customer database  we send certain customers special catalog editions and or e mails 

table of contents we market our websites by the use of paid key words and augmented natural search 
we actively seek beneficial links and are currently linked to over  equine websites 
banner advertising is presently placed on the leading four equestrian content sites and we have an active refer a friend program 
other branding and advertising vehicles we employ include running print ads in local newspapers and trade magazines  sponsoring equestrian events and issuing press releases for major new product offerings 
we also offer a dover saddlery branded credit card operated by national city bank that allows our frequent customers to accumulate reward points that can be redeemed for discounts toward future purchases 
order processing and fulfillment a majority of our orders are received by telephone  but internet orders have rapidly increased since the introduction of our first website in we operate three customer service call centers located in littleton  ma  north conway  nh  and denton  tx 
all of our centers are linked to the same network and share a single customer database that includes a real time recency  frequency and monetary value summary for each customer as well as a direct link to each customer s line item order history over the last five years 
the order entry system is also directly linked to our inventory management system to ensure that product availability is real time 
our  square foot littleton  ma warehouse and office facility also serves as our fulfillment center 
inventory an additional way that we differentiate ourselves from our competition is through our breadth and depth of inventory 
we believe our inventory is deeper than our competitors with million in on hand inventory as of december  with our extensive inventory position and rapid fulfillment capability  we have historically been able to fill approximately of the items ordered within an average of business days 
based on our inventory management systems  continuous monitoring of the products we carry and the fact that we carry very few fashion products  we have historically had very little obsolete inventory 
despite the high level of inventory we have historically maintained  we have turned inventory approximately four times per year and we historically have had no material inventory write downs 
all of the products that are presented in our catalogs are available online and customers can use our websites to enter orders  shop online and check order status and inventory availability 
on average  our retail stores stock inventory items represent over of the merchandise sales we make available through our direct sales channel 
all items are available to customers entering our stores by either direct shipment to a customer s home or for in store pickup 
product mix and merchandising we offer feature rich  need based  functional products encompassing virtually every product necessary to own  train and compete with a horse 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition by our vast breadth and depth of product offerings 
we offer products ranging from entry level price points to the premium high end  and carry leading brands  niche brands and private label brands to meet the broad range of customer expectations and needs 
our product mix has been relatively consistent over the last five years 
we carry the premier names and the most comprehensive offering of the highest quality  broadest range and most technically advanced tack and related gear for serious equestrians 
the sales pattern for equestrian products is fairly consistent from year to year 
introductions of new fashions are generally limited  making sales per item more relatively predictable 
the low sku turnover reduces inventory obsolescence and overstock risks 

table of contents competition we compete based on offering a broad selection of high quality products at competitive prices and superior customer service with knowledgeable staff for our customers 
we believe that our annual direct sales and breadth of product offering are each over twice the size of our closest competitor 
we believe that we benefit from significant barriers to entry with our established dover saddlery brand and with what we believe to be the industry s most comprehensive database 
the retail market for equestrian products is highly fragmented 
there are no national retail chains 
state line tack  which has recently announced the closing of its retail operations  operates as a store within a store at selected petsmart locations  with limited inventory and a direct sales business  and is the only competitor of size 
moreover  only a few regional multi outlet stores compete in the market for equestrian products 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
due to buying patterns around the holiday season and a general slowdown during the later part of the summer months  our revenues are traditionally higher in the fourth quarter

risk factors 
if we cannot successfully execute our planned retail store expansion  our growth and profitability would be adversely impacted 
we currently have nine retail stores and have identified additional locations throughout the us where we plan to open new stores over the next several years 
a significant percentage of our projected future growth is expected to be generated from these new locations 
if we experience delays in opening new stores  fail to select appropriate sites  encounter problems in opening new locations  or have trouble achieving anticipated sales volume in new locations  our growth and profitability will be adversely impacted 
we have only opened two new stores in areas previously served by direct sales and so our experience observing the effects of new stores on our overall sales revenues is limited 
any one or more of the new stores we intend to open may not be profitable  in which event our operating results may suffer 
our ability to expand our retail presence depends in part on the following factors our ability to identify suitable locations in key markets with attractive demographics and which offer attractive returns on our investments  the availability of suitable locations at price points consistent with our expansion model  our ability to negotiate favorable lease and construction terms for such locations  our ability to execute sale leaseback transactions on satisfactory terms  if at all  competition for such locations  the timely construction of such retail stores  our ability to receive local and state government permits and approvals in connection with such locations  our ability to attract  train and retain skilled and knowledgeable store personnel  our ability to provide a product mix that meets the needs of our customers  and favorable economic conditions 
in addition  each retail store is expected to require approximately to million of capital  including start up costs  leasehold improvements and inventory  and excluding the cost of the real estate 
if actual costs are higher than expected or if sales in such stores are lower than expected  we may not be able to open as many retail stores as anticipated or we will need to raise additional capital in order to continue our growth 
if we cannot continue to successfully manage our direct sales channel  it would negatively impact our growth and profitability 
our direct sales generated of our revenues in and we expect such operations to continue to represent a majority of our sales for at least the next several years 
our success depends on our ability to market  advertise and sell our products effectively through our various catalogs and internet sites 
we believe that the success of our direct sales depends on our ability to offer a product mix that is attractive to our customers  the price point of our products relative to our competitors  our ability to achieve adequate response rates to our mailings  our ability to add new customers in a cost effective manner  timely delivery of catalog mailings to our customers  
table of contents an efficient internet interface  a seamless buying experience for our customers across each of our channels  and cost effective and efficient order fulfillment 
catalog production  mailings and paper based packing products  such as shipping cartons  entail substantial paper  postage  human resource and other costs  including costs of catalog development 
we incur most of these costs prior to the mailing of each catalog 
increases in costs of mailing  paper or printing would increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers 
the success of our direct sales hinges on the achievement of adequate response rates to mailings  merchandising and catalog and website presentations that appeal to our customers and the expansion of our potential customer base in a cost effective manner 
lack of consumer response to particular catalog or flier mailings or internet marketing efforts may increase our costs and decrease the profitability of our business 
technology failures and privacy and security breaches could adversely affect the company s business 
sales through our websites generated of our revenues in the success of our online business depends in part on factors over which we have limited control 
these factors include changing customer preferences  changing buying trends related to internet usage  changes in technology interfaces  technology failures or human errors  security breaches and consumer privacy concerns 
any failure to respond successfully to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect sales through our websites  impair our reputation and increase our operating costs 
our retail store rollout could cannibalize existing sales from our direct sales channel or existing retail locations 
our strategy to increase the number of retail store locations is based on finding optimal locations where demand for equestrian products is high 
when we open a retail store in an area that has a high concentration of our existing customers  we expect that such customers will purchase products in the retail location as well as through our catalogs and websites  ultimately increasing their total purchases as multi channel customers 
direct sales in the geographic area surrounding our hockessin  de store declined in the first year of such store s operation 
in the future  in areas where we open retail stores  the customers located within the area of such store may not spend more than they would have from the catalog and websites and therefore there may be a transfer of sales from our direct sales business to our retail stores 
in such case  we may incur significant costs associated with opening a store and mailing catalogs while not generating incremental revenue 
with a significant portion of our growth strategy dependent upon our planned retail store expansion  our quarterly revenues and earnings could be variable and unpredictable and inventory levels will increase 
we plan to increase the rate at which we open new stores 
as we open new stores  i revenues may fluctuate  and ii pre opening expenses are incurred which may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenues during the same financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to variable operating results 
some of the expenses associated with openings of our new retail stores  such as headcount and lease occupancy  will increase 
additionally  as we increase inventory levels to provide stores with merchandise  we may not be able to manage this inventory without incurring additional costs 
if retail store sales are inadequate to support these new costs  our earnings will decrease 

table of contents the terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us  which may impair our ability to grow our business or respond to changing business and economic conditions and could have an adverse impact on our business 
our current revolving credit facility contains provisions which impose minimum cash flow requirements and which restrict our ability to  among other things  incur or repay additional indebtedness  make particular types of investments  incur liens  pay dividends  consummate mergers and consolidations  enter into transactions with affiliates or make substantial asset sales 
in particular  the company received waivers at december  for the ebitda bank covenants 
in addition  our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures 
in the event of our insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the lenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions  if any  were made to our stockholders 
we rely on service providers to operate our business and any disruption of their supply of services could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
we rely on a number of service providers to operate our business such as a printer and a database processor to produce and mail our catalogs  a website hosting service provider to host and manage our websites  telephone companies to provide telephone and fax service to our customer service centers and to communicate between locations  and shipping companies such as dhl airborne  ups  fedex  the us postal service and common carriers for timely delivery of our catalogs  shipment of merchandise to our customers and delivery of merchandise from our suppliers  including foreign suppliers  to us and from our warehouse to our retail stores 
any disruption in these services may have a negative impact on our ability to market and sell our products and serve our customers and could result in increased costs to us 
we rely on merchandise suppliers to operate our business and any disruption of their supply of products could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
we rely on merchandise suppliers to supply our products in saleable condition  in sufficient quantities  at competitive prices and in a timely manner 
in  our single largest merchandise supplier accounted for less than of our sales 
our current merchandise suppliers may not be able to accommodate our anticipated needs in a timely matter or at all 
if we are unable to acquire suitable merchandise in a timely manner or lose one or more key merchandise suppliers  we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe our merchandise supplier relationships are satisfactory  we have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply from our key merchandise suppliers and our merchandise suppliers may discontinue selling to us at any time or may raise the cost of merchandise and we may be unable to pass such price increases along to our customers 
if we do not properly manage our inventory levels  our operating results and available funds for future growth will be adversely affected 
we currently maintain a high level of inventory and have a broad depth of products for our customers 
the investment associated with this high level of inventory is substantial 
if we fail to adequately predict the amount or mix of our inventory  we will incur costs associated with stocking 
table of contents inventory that is not being sold or fails to meet the demands of our customers or we may be required to write off or write down inventory which would hurt our operating results 
if we do not meet the needs of our customers  they may decide to purchase products from our competitors 
although we have some ability to return merchandise to our suppliers  we incur additional costs in doing so and we may not be able to return merchandise in the future 
if our information technology systems fail to perform as designed or if we need to make system changes in order to support our growing direct and retail store businesses  there may be disruptions in operations 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and our point of sale  or pos  systems 
our information technology systems are located in littleton  ma  and our pos systems are located in each retail store 
these systems  which operate our website  process transactions  respond to customer inquiries  manage inventory  purchase  sell and ship goods on a timely basis  and maintain cost effective operations  are subject to damage from natural disasters  power failures  hardware and software failures  security breaches  network failures  computer viruses and operator negligence 
the failure of our information technology systems and our pos systems to perform as designed  even if temporary  could adversely affect inventory levels  shipments to customers and customer service 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures  viruses  computer hackers or other causes 
any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information  including data related to customer orders  to be lost or delayed  which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology to compete with our competitors 
accordingly  if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete  or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our anticipated growth  we could lose customers 
while we believe that our systems are adequate to support our planned opening of additional retail stores over the next several years and the future growth of our direct sales business  we may need to upgrade and modify our information technology capabilities 
any upgrades to our information technology systems and our pos systems may not be successful or may cause substantial expenses 
in addition  there are inherent risks associated with upgrading our core systems  including disruptions that affect our ability to deliver products to our customers 
if we were unable to adequately handle these disruptions  it could adversely affect inventory levels  shipments to customers and customer service 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
a decline in discretionary consumer spending and related externalities could reduce our revenues 
our revenues depend to a degree on discretionary consumer spending  which may decrease due to a variety of factors beyond our control 
these include unfavorable general business conditions  increases in interest rates  increases in inflation  stock market uncertainty  war  terrorism  fears of war or terrorism  increases in consumer debt levels and decreases in the availability of consumer credit  adverse or unseasonable weather conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  increases in taxation  adverse unemployment trends and other factors that adversely influence consumer confidence and spending 
any one of these factors could result in adverse fluctuations in our revenues generally 
our revenues also depend on the extent to which discretionary consumer spending is directed towards recreational activities generally and equestrian activities and products in particular 
reductions in the amounts of discretionary spending directed to such activities would reduce our revenues 

table of contents our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  may decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our revenues would decline  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our results may fluctuate as a result of seasonal changes associated with the equestrian products industry 
we experience seasonal fluctuation in our revenues and operating results 
we typically realize a higher portion of our revenues and operating results during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
competition in the equestrian products market could reduce our revenue and profitability 
the equestrian products market is highly fragmented with approximately  retail store locations nationwide 
many of these are small businesses that have a loyal customer base 
we may therefore not be able to generate sufficient sales to support our new retail store locations 
we also compete directly with state line tack  which has recently announced plans to close its retail operations 
it is owned by petsmart and has greater financial resources than we have 
there are also a significant number of sporting goods stores  mass merchandisers and other better funded companies that could decide to enter into or expand their equestrian products offerings 
in addition  if our competitors reduce their prices  we may have to reduce our prices in order to compete 
we may also be forced to increase our advertising or mail a greater number of catalogs in order to generate the same or even lower level of sales 
any one of these competitive factors could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
a natural disaster or other disruption at our littleton  ma warehouse fulfillment center could cause us to lose merchandise and be unable to deliver products to our direct sales customers and our retail stores 
we currently rely on our littleton  ma warehouse to handle our fulfillment needs 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this center due to fire  flood  tornado  earthquake or any other calamity could damage a significant portion of our inventory  and materially impair our ability to adequately stock our retail stores  deliver merchandise to customers  and process returns to merchandise suppliers and could result in lost revenues and increased costs 
if we lose key members of management or are unable to retain the talent required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of stephen day  our president and chief executive officer  jonathan grylls  our chief operating officer  and other key personnel including our senior executive management 
we currently maintain four million dollars of key man life insurance on mr 
day  the proceeds of which are required to pay down outstanding debt 
effective as of september   we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
day and mr 
grylls  which contain provisions for non competition  non solicitation and severance 
in addition  our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated  full time and temporary sales personnel with appropriate equestrian products industry knowledge and retail experience to work in management and in our retail stores 
the loss of the services of any one of these individuals or the inability to attract and retain qualified individuals for our key management and retail sales positions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents we may need additional financing to execute our growth strategy  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all  which could increase our costs  limit our ability to grow and dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
our current revolving credit facility is due in full on september   which may limit our ability to finance the opening of all of our planned additional stores over the next several years 
in order to satisfy our revolving credit facility when due and to execute our retail store expansion strategy  we may need to borrow additional funds  raise additional equity financing or finance our planned expansion from profits 
we may also need to raise additional capital in the future to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated financial requirements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing  including the extension or refinancing of our revolving credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
a failure to obtain additional financing or an inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to incur indebtedness at high rates of interest or with substantial restrictive covenants  including prohibitions on payment of dividends 
we may obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities that will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be forced to scale back operations or be unable to address opportunities for expansion or enhancement of our operations 
we rely on foreign sources for many of our products  which subjects us to various risks 
we currently source approximately one quarter of our products from foreign manufacturers located in europe  asia and south america 
as such  we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries 
these risks and uncertainties include currency rate fluctuations  import duties and quotas  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  wars and fears of war  acts of terrorism and fear of acts of terrorism  political unrest and trade restrictions 
additionally  countries in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future may become subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
any event affecting prices or causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign merchandise suppliers  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  currency rate fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our operating results 
we do not currently  and we do not plan to  hedge against increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against any foreign currencies 
our product sourcing from foreign merchandise suppliers means  in part  that we may be affected by declines in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies 
specifically  as the value of the us dollar declines relative to other currencies  our effective cost of products increases 
as a result  declines in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would adversely affect our operating results 
our retail store expansion strategy may result in our direct sales business establishing a nexus with additional states  which may cause our direct sales business to pay additional income and sales tax and have an adverse effect on the revenues and cash flows of our direct sales business 
as we open retail stores in additional states  the necessary relationship between the retail stores and our direct sales business may be deemed by certain state tax authorities to create a nexus for state income and sales taxation of our direct sales business in those states 
this could result in an increase in the tax collection and payment obligations of our direct sales business  which would have an adverse effect on the profitability and cash flows of our direct sales business and our overall business 
such sales tax collection obligations  if any  would increase the total cost of our products to our customers 
this increased cost to our customers could negatively affect the revenues of our direct 
table of contents sales business if we are required to reduce the underlying prices for the products sold through our direct sales channel 
the occurrence of either of these events would have an adverse effect on the revenues  costs and cash flows of our direct sales business 
this area of law is uncertain and changing and we could be subject to paying back taxes and penalties 
if we fail to adequately protect our trademarks  our brand and reputation could be impaired or diluted and we could lose customers 
we have  or have rights to  four trademarks that we consider to be material to the successful operation of our business dover saddlery  smith brothers  miller s harness and the source 
we currently use all of these marks in our direct sales business 
we also have several additional pending trademark applications 
we also regard our copyrights  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
in addition to our registered marks and pending applications  our principal intellectual property rights include copyrights in our catalogs  rights to our domain names and our databases and information management systems 
as such  we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
nevertheless  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
our trademark applications may not be granted  and we may not be able to secure significant protection for our marks 
our competitors or others may adopt trademarks or service marks similar to our marks or try to prevent us from using our marks  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
in addition  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
therefore  we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason  our brand and reputation could be impaired or diluted and we may lose customers 
we may have disputes with  or be sued by  third parties for infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights  which could have a negative impact on our business 
other parties may assert claims with respect to patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights that are important to our business  such as our dover saddlery  smith brothers and miller s harness trademarks 
other parties might seek to block the use of  or seek monetary damages or other remedies for the prior use of  our intellectual property or the sale of our products as a violation of their trademark  patent or other proprietary rights 
defending any claims  even claims without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly settlements  litigation or restrictions on our business and could damage our reputation 
in addition  there may be prior registrations or use of intellectual property in the us or foreign countries including  but not limited to  similar or competing marks or other proprietary rights of which we are not aware 
in all such countries  it may be possible for any third party owner of a trademark registration in that country or other proprietary right to enjoin or limit our expansion into those countries or to seek damages for our use of such intellectual property in such countries 
in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property or redesign or rename our products or operations to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  securing registrations does not fully insulate us against intellectual property claims  as another party may have rights superior to our registration or our registration may be vulnerable to attack on various other grounds 
any such claims of infringement or misappropriation  whether meritorious or not  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  prevent us from operating our business  or portions of our business  
table of contents cause us to cease selling certain products  result in the loss of customers  require us to re label or re design certain products  if feasible  result in significant monetary liability  divert management s attention and resources  potentially require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property  and force us to stop using valuable trademarks under which we market our products 
third parties might assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to any of our products 
any such assertion might require us to enter into royalty arrangements or litigation that could be costly to us 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to numerous regulations and regulatory changes that could impact our business or require us to modify our current business practices 
we are subject to numerous regulations governing the internet and e commerce  retailers generally  the importation  promotion and sale of merchandise  and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities 
these regulations include customs  privacy  truth in advertising  consumer protection  shipping and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances 
many of these laws and regulations may specifically impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
if these laws were to change  or are violated by our management  employees  suppliers  buying agents or trading companies  we could experience delays in shipments of our goods or be subject to fines or other penalties which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the growth and demand for online commerce has resulted  and may continue to result  in more stringent consumer compliance burdens on companies that operate in the e commerce segment 
specifically  certain states have enacted various legislation with respect to consumer privacy 
in addition  the federal trade commission and certain state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
the costs of compliance with federal and state privacy laws and the costs that might be incurred in connection with any federal or state investigations could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
our direct mail operations are subject to regulation by the us postal service  the federal trade commission and various state  local and private consumer protection and other regulatory authorities 
in general  these regulations govern the manner in which orders may be solicited  the form and content of advertisements  information which must be provided to prospective customers  the time within which orders must be filled  obligations to customers if orders are not shipped within a specified period of time and the time within which refunds must be paid if the ordered merchandise is unavailable or returned 
from time to time  we have modified our methods of doing business and our marketing operations in response to such regulation 
to date  such regulation has not had a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
however  future regulatory requirements or actions may have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with laws and regulations 
compliance with existing or future laws and regulations may materially limit our ability to operate our business and increase our costs 

table of contents our satisfaction guarantee exposes us to the risk of an increase in our return rates which could adversely affect our profitability 
part of our marketing and advertising strategy focuses on allowing customers to return products ordered from our catalogs at any time if they are not satisfied and obtain a refund of the purchase price 
as we expand our sales  our return rates may not remain within our historically low levels and could significantly impair our profitability 
our marketing expenditures may not result in increased sales or generate the levels of product and brand name awareness we desire and we may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost effective basis 
a significant component of our marketing strategy involves the use of direct marketing to generate sales 
future growth and profitability will depend in part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures  including our ability to create greater awareness of our products and brand name  determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for future marketing expenditures  effectively manage marketing costs  including creative and media  to maintain acceptable costs per inquiry  costs per order and operating margins  and convert inquiries into actual orders 
our marketing expenditures may not result in increased sales or generate sufficient levels of product and brand name awareness and we may not be able to manage such marketing expenditures on a cost effective basis

we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements 
we are a leading specialty retailer and the largest direct marketer of equestrian products in the us for over years  dover saddlery has been a premier upscale marketing brand in the english style riding industry 
we sell our products through a multi channel strategy  including catalogs  the internet and retail stores 
this multi channel strategy has allowed us to use catalogs and our proprietary database of nearly two million names of equestrian enthusiasts as a primary marketing tool to increase catalog sales and to drive additional business to our e commerce websites and retail stores 
historical development our business was started in by top ranked english style riding champions  jim and david powers 
our wellesley  ma retail store opened in and our catalog operations began in in september  stephen day  our current president and chief executive officer and a veteran of the equestrian products direct marketing industry  and certain other investors acquired a controlling interest in dover 
in  we launched our main website  www 
doversaddlery 
com 
in  we opened our second dover saddlery store in hockessin  de and we expanded into the western style market by acquiring the smith brothers catalog and website  www 
smithbrothers 
com 
in  we acquired rights to the miller s harness brand for use in catalog and internet sales to target entry level and lower cost equestrian products customers 
we opened a smith brothers store in denton  tx in and our third dover saddlery store in plaistow  nh in in september  we opened our new hunt valley  md store 
in addition  we acquired dominion saddlery and over the next nine months  have remodeled  expanded and converted the four stores into dover saddlery stores 
we offer a comprehensive selection of products required to own  train and compete with a horse  selling from under to over  our products fall into the following three main categories saddles and tack  specialized apparel  and horse care and stable products 
we have historically focused on the english style riding market 
dover is known for providing the highest quality products for english style riding  including premier brands such as hermes  ariat  grand prix  mountain horse  passier and prestige 
we offer what we believe is the largest selection of exclusive and semi exclusive equestrian products in the industry 
to further broaden our offerings  we began selling into the western style riding market in under the smith brothers name 
we have carefully built a multi channel platform for growth by developing an extensive consumer database of equestrian enthusiasts and dover customers 
we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the synergies of combining catalog and internet operations with a retail store channel 
by marketing our products across integrated  multiple sales channels  we have strengthened our brand visibility and brand equity  expanded our customer database and increased revenues  profits and market share 
while our catalog acts as the primary marketing vehicle to increase internet and store traffic  each of our channels reinforces the other and generates additional customers 
because 
table of contents we sell equestrian products through multiple channels to the same customer base  we operate in one reportable business segment 
consolidated performance and trends in net income was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in net income increased in and decreased in the increase in net income in was attributable to our growth in both our direct and retail revenue channels  as well as reduced interest costs 
the decrease in net income in was primarily due to slower growth in and increased deferred financing costs 
we achieved the results in by continuing to execute our growth strategies of expanding revenues in both our direct and retail channels 
our direct revenues increased in through catalog and internet initiatives to both existing and new customers 
this trend of increased direct revenue is dependent upon the continued response of our customers to these initiatives 
we respond to fluctuations in response by adjusting the quantities of catalogs mailed and other marketing strategies in order to maximize revenue opportunity and manage costs 
our retail revenues increased in due primarily to our strategic expansion of retail stores as well as same store sales growth 
this trend of increased revenue and profitability is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our expansion strategy by opening new store locations and our customers continued support of new retail stores 
we respond to fluctuations in retail revenues by adjusting marketing efforts and operations to support our retail stores and manage costs  as well as continuing to focus on our proprietary store optimization modeling to determine the rate and location of new store openings 
revenues we market and sell the most comprehensive selection of products in the equestrian industry 
we currently derive our revenues from product sales through three integrated distribution channels catalog  internet and our retail stores 
our direct sales consist of product sales generated from both catalog mailings and internet marketing  and our retail store sales consist of products sold through our retail stores 
we sell to the english style riding market through our dover saddlery brand and to the western style riding market through our smith brothers brand 
in  approximately of our revenues resulted from sales through our direct channel  and resulted from sales at our nine retail stores which increased significantly from the of retail sales in  due primarily to the beginning of our retail rollout plan 
all revenues are recorded net of product returns 
revenues from our product sales are seasonal 
in addition  our revenues can be affected by the timing of our catalog mailings 
in  of our revenues were generated in the fourth quarter 
cost of revenues the most significant components of our cost of revenues are product costs  purchasing  handling and transportation costs to obtain the products and ship them to our customers 
we manage our integrated merchandising efforts by forming positive relationships with over suppliers to ensure competitive costs and the most up to date and complete product offering for our customers 
we have implemented procedures to promote labor efficiencies in the handling of our products 
in addition  we work closely with transportation companies in negotiating competitive rate structures to manage our freight costs 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenues varies according to the season of the year and the mix of products sold 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers  as some companies include all of the costs related to distribution in cost of revenues while others  like us  exclude all or a portion of the costs related to distribution from cost of revenues and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  primarily associated with developing  printing and distributing our catalogs and internet advertising  labor and related costs for order processing  and salaries and related costs for marketing  creative and executive personnel  infrastructure costs and information system costs  credit card processing fees  occupancy and other overhead costs  store pre opening costs  public company  professional fees and other legal  accounting and related costs  and amortization of non cash  stock based compensation 
as we focus on increasing our market penetration and continuing to build brand awareness  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of our revenues are not likely to decrease in the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to take advantage of our market leading position in the equestrian industry by building on the dover saddlery and smith brothers brands 
we also expect our general and administrative expenses will increase due to our operations as a public company

revenues in our direct sales channel increased million  or to million  and revenues in our retail store channel increased million  or to million 
the increase in revenues from our direct sales channel was due to higher unit volumes through both catalog and the internet  and from both the dover saddlery and the smith brothers brands 
the increase in our retail revenues was attributable to two new dover stores  the dominion acquisition and growth in same store sales 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the year  from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was held constant at for the year 
the increase of million in gross profit was due to increased revenues in both our retail and direct sales channels 
the consistency in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was attributable to positive variations in both overall product mix and the sales mix of our catalogs  partially offset by increased freight costs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues for the year ended in  from million of revenues in the million increase includes million in marketing costs  primarily catalog expense  internet advertising and new store support to drive increased revenues 
labor and related costs increased approximately million to support the new retail stores  increased direct channel sales and increased merchandising support functions 
facility costs for new retail store space increased million in the fourth quarter of new public company costs  consisting of legal  audit  investor relations  and insurance fees increased by million over the prior year 

table of contents interest expense interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs attributed to our subordinated debt and revolving credit facility  decreased to million for the year ended in  compared to million in our debt levels were reduced substantially as the result of the interim application of the company proceeds from the ipo  resulting in decreased interest expense for both senior and remaining subordinated debt

net income net income for the year ended in was million  an increase of  or million over the million net income achieved in this substantial increase is due to the growth in our direct and retail revenues and gross profits  as well as reduced interest costs  all partially offset by our investment in marketing  increased freight costs  and the costs of being a public company 
our earnings per share  fully diluted  increased to per share from the prior year of per share 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues our total revenues increased to million in  from million in  a total increase of million 
revenues in our direct sales channel increased million  or  and revenues in our retail store channel increased million  or 
the increase in revenues from our direct sales channel was attributed to higher unit volumes through both catalog and the internet from both the dover saddlery and the smith brothers brands 
the higher volumes are attributed to increases in catalog circulation  which was mitigated by soft consumer demand in the first and third quarters of the year  attributable to low consumer confidence and the effects of the gulf coast hurricanes on gasoline prices and direct sales channel revenues 
the increase in revenues from our retail store channel was due primarily to the successful opening of our dover store in plaistow  nh in april which generated approximately million during gross profit gross profit increased to million in  from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues slightly increased to in  from of revenues in the increase of million in gross profit was due primarily to increased revenues  primarily in our retail store channel

amortization of non cash stock based compensation was approximately million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents interest expense interest expense of million in  including amortization of deferred financing costs attributed to our subordinated debt and revolving credit facility  was approximately million more than interest expense of million 
this increase was due primarily to financing related costs  certain of which are non recurring  including accelerated write off of deferred financing fees in connection with the payment of debt  incurrence of prepayment fees on debt reduction  other financing fees  and the increased debt levels required to finance the redemption of stock from a stockholder 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of  as compared to million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the lower effective rate in versus is attributable to the deductibility of certain non cash stock based compensation charges 
net income net income for the year decreased to million  due primarily to the slower growth of our direct revenue  increased investment in marketing  and increased deferred debt financing costs 
quarterly results of operations since  our quarterly product sales have ranged from a low of approximately to a high of approximately of any calendar year s results 
the beginning of the spring outdoor riding season in the northern half of the country has typically generated a slightly stronger second quarter of the year  and the holiday buying season has generated additional demand for our normal equestrian product lines in the fourth quarter of the year 
revenues for the first and third quarters of the calendar year have tended to be somewhat lower than the second and fourth quarters 
we anticipate that our revenues will continue to vary somewhat by season 
the timing of our new retail store openings has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly results 
we will incur one time expenses related to the opening of each new store 
as we open new stores  i revenues may spike and then settle and ii pre opening expenses  including such expenses as occupancy and management overhead  are incurred  which may not be offset by correlating revenues during the same financial reporting period 
as a result of these factors  new retail store openings may result in temporary declines in operating profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the following tables presenting our un audited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we have prepared the un audited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements 
you should also keep in mind  as you read the following tables  that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year 

table of contents the following table presents our un audited quarterly results of operations for the eight fiscal quarters ended december  this table includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair statement of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented

cash was also utilized for general working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements and third party debt service requirements 
the sources for the cash utilized were cash flows generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we may in the future need to obtain additional financing from banks  or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
operating activities the cash utilized by our operating activities in was million  comprised of million of net income and non cash expenses  increased by additional payables and accrued expenses of million 
cash was reduced by additional inventory of million  primarily for new retail stores and support of increased revenues  higher seasonal prepaid catalog costs  and receivables generated by higher year end sales levels 
cash provided by our operating activities in was million  consisting primarily of net income and non cash expenses totaling million  reduced by inventory increases of million  mostly for the new plaistow  nh store  as well as seasonal reductions in prepaid catalogs of million 
in  cash provided by our operating activities was primarily due to net income of million and non cash expenses of million  which were partially offset by an increase in inventory of million  due to the opening of a new retail store  in addition to our normal revenues related increases 

table of contents investing activities cash used in our investing activities was million in  with million attributable to the dominion acquisition  million of retail store build out and equipment costs  and million in other assets and deposits 
cash used in our investing activities in was million  and in was million 
investment activities throughout these periods represent the purchase of capital equipment in support of our growth  including leasehold improvements  computer equipment  internal use software  furniture and fixtures and the purchase of other assets 
continued high levels of investment activities can be expected in and future years to fit out planned new retail stores with leasehold improvements  computer equipment  fixtures  furniture and other assets 
financing activities net cash provided by our financing activities was million in  consisting primarily of million in additional utilization of our revolving debt facility 
in  net cash provided by our financing activities was million 
the net proceeds of the company portion of our offering were million  which were utilized to pay down subordinated debt by million  reduce our revolving credit line  and provide cash for the business 
in september  those facilities were utilized to consummate the million repurchase of treasury stock more fully described below 
in  net cash used in our financing activities consisted primarily of million for repayment of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in capital lease payments 
revolving credit facility in september  we renewed and increased our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  under which we can borrow up to million  including million for letters of credit 
interest accrues at a variable rate based on both prime and published libor rates 
the credit facility expires on september  at which time all advances will be immediately due and payable 
as of december   the revolving credit facility borrowing limit was million and the amount outstanding under the credit facility was million at a rate of and the unused amount available was million 
borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets 
under the terms of our credit facility  we are subject to certain covenants including  among others  maximum funded debt ratios and capital expenditures  and minimum operating cash flows and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility with the exception of our minimum ebitda and maximum capital expenditure limitations  for which waivers were obtained 
we also obtained covenant amendments on a prospective basis 
if a default occurs  the bank may require that we repay all amounts then outstanding 
any amounts which we may be required to repay prior to a scheduled repayment date  however  would reduce funds that we could otherwise allocate to other opportunities that we consider desirable 
senior subordinated note and warrant on september   we closed an amended and restated senior subordinated note and warrant purchase agreement with patriot capital funding  inc  which provided for our issuance of a senior subordinated note payable  which is due in full on september  for aggregate proceeds of million 
of such proceeds  million was used to pay off a previously existing subordinated note payable and million was used to pay a portion of a million purchase price of  shares of our common stock 
the note is a general senior subordinated obligation  is subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt  ranks equal in right of payment with any of our future senior subordinated debt and is senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated debt 
interest at an annual rate of is payable monthly on the fifth business day of the month 
prepayment on the principal amount due under the note may voluntarily be made at any time in multiples of  plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment fee equal to the principal amount prepaid multiplied by if prepayment is made prior to september   by 
table of contents if prepayment is made prior to september   if prepayment is made prior to september  and if prepayment is made prior to september  mandatory prepayment is required upon a change in control 
simultaneously with the issuance of this note  we issued a warrant to patriot capital funding  inc exercisable at any time after march  for up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was exercised in march in december  we utilized proceeds from our public offering to prepay million of the debt due under the note  leaving a balance of  at december  and treasury stock transaction on september   the holder of all  shares of our outstanding preferred stock converted all of its shares of preferred stock into  shares of our common stock 
we repurchased  of such shares of common stock for a purchase price of million 
we funded million of the million purchase price by increasing our existing interest bearing note payable to a third party to million and drew on our amended credit facility for the remaining million 
working capital and capital expenditure needs we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  expected cash to be provided by our operating activities  and funds available through our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the expansion of our retail stores  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations and cash from our revolving credit facility under the conditions and covenants of our credit facilities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual obligations we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under our revolving credit facility and leases for our headquarters and distribution facility  as well as our retail stores and miscellaneous office space 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december   unless otherwise noted payments due by period total in thousands short term bank borrowings capital leases operating leases revolving credit facility senior subordinated notes total

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of shipment to catalog and internet customers and at the point of sale to retail store customers 
at the time of recognition  we provide a reserve for projected product returns based on prior return experience 
for the periods presented  merchandise returns have been consistent  resulting in period end reserves of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we do not anticipate changes to the future trends of our merchandise returns 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized at the time the products are shipped to the customer and are included in net revenues 
shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
inventory valuation inventory consists of finished goods in our warehouse and retail stores 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost  with cost determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or net realizable market value 
we continuously monitor the costs allocated to ensure adequate valuation of the related products 
our reserve for inventory obsolescence was  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
inventory valuation charges have remained consistent throughout each period presented 
we do not foresee any change to this trend which currently recognizes annual valuation charges below that of the period end reserve balances 
advertising costs and catalog expenses the costs of direct response advertising materials  primarily catalog production and distribution  are deferred in accordance with statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs 
these costs are recognized over the period of expected future revenues  which is less than one year 
advertising costs not related to our direct response catalogs and marketing activities are expensed as incurred 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method wherein the deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the difference between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities  multiplied by the expected tax rate in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax expense results from the change in the net deferred tax asset or liability between periods 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 as of january   using the modified prospective method 
therefore  the results for the years ended december  and have not been restated 
consistent with the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company recognized  of stock based compensation for the year ended december  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we do not believe that any of our long lived assets were impaired as of december  and we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment 
management has determined  based on the guidance of sfas no 
 there is one reporting unit  the company as a whole 
we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill as of december  based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we have determined that no impairment had occurred  as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value 
therefore  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk nearly all of our revenues are derived from transactions denominated in us dollars 
we purchase products in the normal course of business from foreign manufacturers 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with those product purchases  but this exposure has not been significant 
impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have not been material in recent years 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
as of december   all of our investments were held in money market and other short term investment accounts 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this revolving credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the prime rate and the published libor rate at the time of the borrowing 
if interest rates were to increase by one percent  the additional interest expense as of december  would be approximately  annually 
at december   there was million outstanding under our revolving credit facility
