item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our tools  technologies and expertise are enablers in the semiconductor industry s transition to larger mm wafers  sub nm design rules and the use of new materials  such as copper  low capacitance low k dielectrics and barrier metals 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
in  we achieved record revenues  which increased by to million from million in gross margin increased year over year by million as a result of the increased revenue  but gross margin percentage declined slightly  primarily due to reduced royalty revenue 
operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue by due to increased sales and continued efforts to control operating costs 
income before taxes was million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of sales in we also increased our research development and engineering rd e activity in to expand our product portfolio to accommodate sub nanometer design rules  driving an increase in rd e expenses of million  or part of our strategy is to outsource selected non critical functions in manufacturing  spare parts logistics  subsystem design and other areas to third parties specializing in these areas 
this allows us to concentrate our resources on our core technologies in strip and rtp and leverage our expertise into new markets  reduce our fixed costs and achieve greater flexibility to expand and contract capacity as market conditions require 
in  our lean  flexible organization demonstrated that we could maintain profitability through a full industry cycle 
although we have implemented cost cutting and operational flexibility measures  we are largely dependent upon increases in sales and decreases in cost of sales in order to improve our profitability 
we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no long term debt at december  with our continued strong operating results and our current cash position  we believe we are in a healthy position in terms of liquidity and capital resources 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment  and our ability to a significantly grow the company  either organically or through acquisitions  in order to enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles and e generate the gross margins necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business

the increase in net sales in compared with was primarily due to a million increase in system sales  or  and a million increase in service and spare parts sales  or 
sales in represent strong growth in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers due to increasing demand for consumer electronics 
in  we received business from leading semiconductor manufacturers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
korea was our fastest growing equipment market in  with a sales increase from our net sales for included million of royalty revenue from dainippon screen co 
dns  compared with million for international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for of net sales in  compared to for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to our overall increase in sales 
our gross profit for included million of royalty revenue received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of sales 
gross profit margin decreased by percentage points in compared to  primarily due to lower gross profit margin of percentage points due to net deferral of systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  lower gross profit margin from dns of percentage points and lower gross profit margin from service and spare parts sales of percentage points  which was partially offset by higher gross profit margin related to systems sales of percentage points 
due to intense competition  we continue to face pricing pressure that can affect our gross profit margin 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale  material costs and other costs  overhead absorption levels and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
requirements 
research  development and engineering rd e expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our rd e staff as well as contractors fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and development of new products 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand our portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process  outside service costs  sales commissions  advertising and promotional materials  sales facilities expense  trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administration  operations and general management  headquarters and general office facilities costs  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
in  we continued to streamline our internal operations and adjust our resources through outsourcing in an effort to create a more flexible organization that can operate profitably through changing industry cycles 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a million increase in outside service expenses  which related to higher levels of business activity and to the additional audit  legal and other professional expenses efforts needed to complete our form k and restate certain financial statements  a charge of million for stock based compensation in due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  other increased salary and benefits expenses of million primarily due to increased benefits costs  increased travel expenses of million due to higher levels of business activity  and increased support costs for evaluation equipment of million  partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expenses 
sg a expenses were also million higher in due to a charge of million in for allowance for doubtful accounts  compared to a corresponding benefit of million in as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses decreased in compared to because of the increase in net sales in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses in were due to our acquisition of vortek in october we estimate our annual amortization expense to be million for the years through gain on disposition of wet business 
in  we concluded all activities related to the disposition of the wet business  and released a remaining accrual of million  which was previously established as an estimate of a portion of the projected costs to fulfill our obligations under the sale of the wet business 
impairment of intangibles 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the book value of certain intangible assets  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the write down represented the remaining book value of the radiant technology acquired from vortek in october of see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income increased in compared with due to higher investment balances in and higher average interest rates 
interest expense for and remained minimal 
the million increase in other income expense  net in compared with was primarily due to a million increase in due to million in gains on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in compared to million in losses on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in  partially offset by a million reduction due to foreign currency translation losses 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes  a million provision for taxes in germany  and a provision of million for other foreign taxes 
we reduced our current tax liability by million through the utilization of certain acquired tax assets  largely consisting of net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the acquisition of steag in the federal and state tax provision for  however  does not reflect a benefit for the utilization of these net operating losses  as it was used to reduce the goodwill originally recorded in the acquisition 
the tax benefit in primarily consisted of a million benefit due to a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a million benefit from the release of certain foreign tax reserves 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period for the employee 
we previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  in we recorded stock based compensation cost totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method been applied since the effective date of sfas no 
we did not restate previously reported amounts 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of stock based compensation related to stock options 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation after estimated forfeitures related to stock options  which will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of stock based compensation related to our employee stock purchase plan and million of compensation cost related to restricted stock units 
compensation cost for restricted stock units is determined based on the grant date fair value of the shares of common stock  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation  after estimated forfeitures  related to non vested restricted stock units granted under the equity incentive plan 
we expect to recognize that cost over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed in both amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit  operating expenses research  development and engineering   selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles   gain on disposition of wet business  n m total operating expenses  income from operations    interest income    interest expense other income expense  net n m income before income taxes   benefit for income taxes  net income  not meaningful sales 
the decrease in net sales in compared with was primarily due to a million decrease in system sales  or  and a million decrease in service and spare parts sales  or 
sales in represented a decline following very strong capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers in korea was the fastest growing equipment market in  with a increase in sales from  however overall sales declined due to a decline in sales for japan  taiwan and other asian countries 
net sales for included million of royalty revenue from dns  compared with million for international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for of net sales in  compared to for gross profit and gross profit margin 
the decrease in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to the overall decline in sales 
additionally  gross margin was negatively impacted by million in due to inventory valuation charges 
gross profit for included million of royalty revenue received from dns  compared with million for gross profit margin declined in compared with primarily due to inventory valuation charges  which accounted for percentage points of the decline in additionally  warranty expenses as a percentage of sales increased percentage points in  although total warranty expenses were slightly lower 
research  development and engineering 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand the portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
the decrease in sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a million reduction due to reduced accounts receivables reserves in  a million decrease in travel expenses and a million decrease in corporate insurance expenses  partially offset by an increase of million for outsourcing costs for professional services  primarily related to increased accounting and consulting expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses increased in compared to because of the decrease in net sales in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses increased in compared with primarily due to our acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
in october gain on disposition of wet business 
in  earn out payments of approximately million were received in relation to the disposition of the wet business in this payment was recorded as additional proceeds from the sale of the wet business  and the payment was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income increased in compared with due to higher investment balances in interest expense for and were minimal 
the decrease in other income expense  net in compared with was primarily due to million in losses on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in january provision for income taxes 
the tax benefit in primarily consisted of a million benefit due to a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a million benefit from the release of certain foreign tax reserves 
the tax benefit in was primarily due to a million tax benefit resulting from reduced foreign income tax liabilities and a one time million tax benefit related to a refund of taxes that had been previously withheld and expensed at the time of the dns settlement in the third quarter of  partially offset by tax expenses related to foreign operations 
deferred revenue at december  and deferred revenue at december  increased to million from million at december   primarily due to a million increase for the deferral of a portion of system shipments in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  partially offset by a million decrease in deferred service contract revenue and a million decrease in deferred revenue for system shipments which were fully deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
deferred revenue at december  of million consisted of million of deferred revenue related to installation services awaiting completion for sales of established products  million of deferred revenue related to tools deferred in accordance with our policy and million in unearned service contract revenue 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million held as of december  stockholders equity at december  was million 
credit arrangements in april  we renewed our million revolving line of credit with a bank  which may be increased to million at our option 
the revolving line of credit now expires in april and has an annual commitment fee of  at december   we were in compliance with all covenants and we had no borrowing under this credit line 
our japanese subsidiary has a credit facility with a japanese bank in the amount of million yen approximately million at december   collateralized by specific trade accounts receivable of the japanese subsidiary 
there are no financial covenant requirements for this credit facility 
at december   there was no borrowing under this credit facility 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table operating vendor commitments sublease lease payments subcontractor inventory other total income thousands thereafter  other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
in connection with the acquisition of vortek  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under that agreement  as amended  we or vortek agreed to various covenants  including a payment by us of a royalty to the minister of of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million at december   and b vortek maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october  if we  or vortek  do not satisfy our obligations  the minister may demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  approximately million at december  less any royalties paid by vortek or us to the minister 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs  and license fees 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  dns paid us minimum annual royalty payments of million each year 
in  and  dns made additional payments of million  million and million  respectively  based on sales by dns for their fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in total  million of these payments were applied against the minimum payment due in june  and million of these payments were in excess of the minimum payments 
we have received all scheduled minimum annual royalty payments 
the remaining royalty payments to be paid by dns under the license agreement will be due in june and june  based on sales by dns through january  as of december   dns has made payments aggregating million under the terms of the settlement and license agreements 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash charges of million for impairment of intangibles and million for stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to record sales in the fourth quarter and an increase in inventories of million 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  a decrease in advance billings of million  a decrease in inventories of million and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and noncurrent assets of million 
a significant portion of the change in our balance sheet accounts resulted from a higher level of sales at the end of  which had required increased working capital 
net cash used in operations of million in was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to reduction in inventory reserves of million as a result of improvement in inventory control and disposal of obsolete inventories and increases of inventories of purchased parts and raw materials of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  largely due to reduction in tool related retrofit accruals and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by net income of million  a decrease in advanced billings of million and depreciation and amortization charges of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to additions of technology used in our rd e activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and gains from earn out payments related to the sale of our wet business of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to additions of technology used in our rd e activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million  capital spending of million  which was primarily for the build out of our manufacturing operations as a result of consolidation of manufacturing facilities in fremont  california  loans to vortek prior to acquisition of million and net cash of million paid in connection with the vortek acquisition  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
in  we established corporate credit cards with a new bank and closed our previous corporate account  which had required a compensating cash balance of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted primarily of the net proceeds of million from an underwritten public offering of approximately million newly issued shares of common stock priced at per share issued in february we used the net proceeds received from the offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements 
acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
on october   we acquired certain outstanding debt and equity ownership interests in vortek industries ltd 
vortek  a privately held corporation amalgamated under the laws of british columbia  for a total purchase price of million 
vortek  based in vancouver  canada  is a developer of millisecond flash annealing technology for rapid thermal processing of silicon wafers used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million shares of mattson common stock valued at approximately million and approximately million in cash for acquisition related expenses 
prior to the closing date of the vortek acquisition october   mattson provided loans to vortek aggregating million 
these loans still existed at december  and december  and were eliminated in consolidation 
as a result of the transaction  vortek became our wholly owned subsidiary 
this acquisition was consummated principally to expand and strengthen our rtp technology portfolio and support our long term growth strategy 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and  accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition  based on management estimates and relative fair value assessments 
the results of operations of vortek have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 
our allocation of the purchase price is summarized as follows purchase price allocation thousands goodwill  existing technology estimated useful life of years  current assets  property  plant and equipment liabilities assumed  deferred tax liability on intangibles  in addition  we acquired cad million approximately million at december  of deferred tax assets in connection with the acquisition of vortek  which had a full valuation allowance at december  in  we adjusted the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the vortek transaction 
pursuant to the adjustment  we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by approximately million 
this resulted in a reduction of goodwill of approximately million 
the resulting deferred tax asset of million and million at december  and has been offset against the recorded deferred tax liabilities of million and million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to evaluate in each reporting period the carrying value of our long lived assets and to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our overall evaluation of impairment  we conducted a thorough review of the intangible assets acquired in the vortek acquisition 
during this process  we looked at resource constraints  strategic focus and potential market opportunities for both the radiant and flash rtp technologies acquired from vortek 
we decided that it is in mattson s best interest to focus solely on the flash rtp business  and determined that the remaining book value of intangible assets relating to the radiant technology were fully impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the net book value of the radiant technology in the fourth quarter of capital finance transactions on february   we sold approximately million newly issued shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering priced at per share 
this resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in the same offering  a shareholder sold approximately million previously outstanding shares 
reclassifications for presentation purposes  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the reporting in the current period financial statements 
these reclassifications do not affect our net income  cash flows or stockholders equity 
depreciation expense associated with customer evaluation tools was previously classified as a component of cost of goods sold 
effective july   we classify this depreciation expense as a selling expense  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for all sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally of the total invoice price  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and title transfer of the tool  and the remaining portion of the total invoice price  generally of the total invoice price  which is due once installation services have been accepted  is not recognized as revenue until final customer acceptance of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customers 
in and earlier periods  revenues associated with sales to customers in japan were recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurred upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of rtp products through our distributor in japan  where we recognized revenues upon title transfer to the distributor 
in december  we expanded our distributor relationship in japan to cover all our products 
under the new distributor agreement  revenues are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon shipment to the distributor 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
we recognize service and maintenance contract revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with business acquisitions 
the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
a severe decline in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not to be impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
there were no events or changes in circumstances during the first three quarters of that triggered an impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the first step of our annual impairment test based on management estimates and fair value assessments  which did not indicate any impairment  thus  the second step was not necessary 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the book value of an intangible asset  as required by sfas no 
the write down represented the remaining book value of the radiant technology acquired from vortek in october of see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record any impairment charge 
income taxes 
at december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  related to our german operations  as we expected that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from the german net deferred tax asset as of december  and for all other tax jurisdictions  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of adjustment 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
 which provides the sec staff s views regarding interactions between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
total share based compensation during was million 
for more information on stock based compensation costs for the year ended december   refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options  restricted stock awards and rights to purchase shares under employee stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value 
we use historical volatility based on past performance of our common stock to estimate expected volatility as we believe historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected future volatility 
if we determine that another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life is more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for share based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected lives result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in was insignificant 
the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates
