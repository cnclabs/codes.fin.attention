the discussion and analysis is relevant to our historical results of operations  which reports consolidated results including two segments  domestic and foreign 

table of contents market overview domestically our business continues to be concentrated in the communications and energy markets 
during  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in all of our major markets 
in our communications markets  which consist of telecommunications  cable television catv and data communication  telecommunication companies continued to curtail their investment in the construction and maintenance of copper networks while diverting some of these resources into fiber to the premise fttp projects 
purchasing patterns for fttp material stabilized in as service providers worked off the inventory built up during sales of products for the catv markets were negatively impacted as service providers continued to delay investment in infrastructure improvements 
sales into the data communications market were flat 
as a result  our sales to the overall communications market decreased in we anticipate growth in the level of activity related to fiber network build outs in and renewed investment in the catv market 
we expect data communications sales to remain flat and investment in the copper network will continue to decline 
in  we experienced growth in our domestic energy markets 
we believe the investment in new transmission and distribution grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure will continue to increase over the next five years 
we continue to introduce new transmission and distribution products to satisfy this anticipated growth 
our foreign business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our foreign sales were primarily to the distribution portion of the energy market 
in  we continued to increase our energy distribution sales while also experiencing significant sales growth in the energy transmission market 
we expect that growth in the energy markets will continue for the foreseeable future not only as new construction projects are added in developing markets but  as in the domestic markets  there is a need to rebuild and refurbish much of the foreign energy transmission and distribution infrastructure 
we believe that we are positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies

we have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment  office and computer equipment and capital leases primarily for equipment 
one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk for the residual value in excess of the market value of the aircraft 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value

at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our existing cash position  together with our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities but at an increased cost for interest and commitment fees 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years thousands of dollars long term debt a leases purchase commitments pension contribution b amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial less than commitments total year years years after years thousands of dollars letters of credit guarantees a interest on long term debt is included in the table at interest rates from to based on the variable interest rates in effect at december  
table of contents b amount represents the expected contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan in future expected amounts have not been disclosed as such amounts are subject to change based on performance of the assets in the plan as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance represented approximately of our trade receivables at december  and excess and obsolescence reserves we have provided an allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence based on estimates of future demand  which is subject to change 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
at december   the allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence was of gross inventories  compared to of gross inventories at december  if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or reversals of existing reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 

table of contents our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no trigger events during  or and as such only an annual impairment test was performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we established a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made
