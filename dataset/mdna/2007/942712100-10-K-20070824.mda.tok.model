executive overview watson wyatt is a global consulting firm focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services 
we provide services in five principal practice areas benefits  technology and administration solutions  human capital consulting  investment consulting and insurance and financial services  operating from countries throughout north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america 
in the short term  our revenues are driven by many factors including the general state of the global economy and the resulting level of discretionary spending by our clients  the ability of our consultants to attract new clients or cross sell to existing clients  and the impact of new regulations in the legal and accounting fields that most recently increased demand for our executive compensation and benefits practices 
in the long term  we expect that the company s financial results will depend in large part upon how well we succeed in deepening our existing client relationships through thought leadership and focus on cross practice solutions  actively pursuing new clients in our target markets  cross selling and strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the highly fragmented industry in which we operate represents tremendous growth opportunities for us  because we offer a unique business combination of benefits and human capital consulting as well as strategic technology solutions 
we design  develop and implement human resource strategies and programs through the following closely interrelated practice areas benefits group the benefits group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  is the foundation of our business 
retirement  the core of our benefits group business  is less impacted by discretionary spending reductions than our other segments  mainly due to the recurring nature of client relationships 
our corporate client retention rate within our target market has remained very high 
revenue for our retirement practice is seasonal  with the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year being the busier periods 
major revenue growth drivers in this practice include changes in regulations  particularly those affecting pension plans in the uk  leverage from other practices  an improving economy  increased global demand and increased market share 
technology and administration solutions group our technology and administration solutions group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  provides information technology services to our customers 
human capital group our human capital group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  generally encompasses short term projects 
as a result  this segment is most sensitive to cyclical economic fluctuations 
investment consulting group our investment consulting group accounts for percent of our total fiscal year revenues 
this business  although relationship based  can be affected by volatility in investment returns  particularly as clients look to us for assistance in managing that volatility 
insurance and financial services group our insurance financial services group accounts for percent of our total fiscal year revenues 
this business is characterized by ongoing relationships with our clients who will typically use our skills on a number of different projects 
financial statement overview watson wyatt s fiscal year ends june the wwllp business combination was completed july  and as a result  our financial statements reflect the consolidation of the european operations through watson wyatt limited beginning august  prior to july   or for one month of the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded its share of the results of wwllp and wwhe using the equity method of accounting 
this income is reflected in the income from affiliates line on our income statement 
our share of the results of our affiliated captive insurance company  professional consultants insurance company  inc pcic  continues to be recorded using the equity method of accounting  and is also reflected in the income from affiliates line 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed based on time and materials or on a fixed fee basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue generally recognized as services are performed 
for fiscal years   and  revenue from us consulting operations has comprised approximately  and percent of consolidated revenue  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than percent of our consolidated revenue for any of the most recent three fiscal years 
in delivering consulting services  our principal direct expenses relate to compensation of personnel 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs  and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for employment  marketing and other services  including reserves for professional liability claims 
for the last three fiscal years  approximately to percent of these professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
occupancy  communications and other expenses represent expenses for rent  utilities  supplies and telephone to operate office locations as well as non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
this line item also includes miscellaneous expenses  including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
general and administrative expenses include the operational costs  professional fees and insurance premiums associated with corporate management  general counsel  marketing  human resources  finance  research and technology support 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients  discretionary compensation  income taxes  pension assumptions  incurred but not reported claims  and goodwill and intangible assets 
the critical accounting policies discussed below involves making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial statements and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue includes fees primarily generated from consulting services provided 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements when hours are worked  either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
the terms of our contracts with clients are fixed and determinable and may change based upon agreement by both parties 
individual consultants billing rates are principally based on a multiple of salary and compensation costs 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements  which span multiple months  is based upon the percentage of completion method 
the company typically has three types of fixed fee arrangements annual recurring projects  projects of a short duration  and non recurring system projects 
annual recurring projects and the projects of short duration are typically straightforward and highly predictable in nature 
as a result  the project manager and financial staff are able to identify  as the project status is reviewed and bills are prepared monthly  the occasions when cost overruns could lead to the recording of a loss accrual 
our non recurring system projects are typically found in our technology and administration solutions group 
they tend to be more complex projects that are longer in duration and subject to more changes in scope as the project progresses than projects undertaken in other segments 
we evaluate at least quarterly  and more often as needed  project managers estimates to complete to assure that the projects current status is accounted for properly 
our technology and administration solutions group contracts generally provide that if the client terminates a contract  the company is entitled to payment for services performed through termination 
revenue recognition for fixed fee engagements is affected by a number of factors that change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
the periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion that  in turn  affect how we recognize revenue 
the company recognizes a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the company has experienced certain costs in excess of estimates from time to time 
management believes that it is rare  however  for these excess costs to result in overall project losses 
the company has developed various software programs and technologies that we provide to clients in connection with consulting services 
in most instances  such software is hosted and maintained by the company and ownership of the technology and rights to the related code remain with the company 
software developed to be utilized in providing services to a client  but for which the client does not have the contractual right to take possession  is capitalized in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
revenue associated with the related contract  together with amortization of the related capitalized software  is recognized over the service period 
as a result we do not recognize revenue during the implementation phase of an engagement 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections and invoices generated in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses and any third party costs  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenue 
valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from our clients failure to pay for our services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is generally recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of our billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write off history 
facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due  general market conditions  current economic trends and our clients ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 
discretionary compensation the company s compensation program includes a discretionary annual bonus that is determined by management and paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after the company s annual operating results are finalized 
an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process 
quarterly  estimated annual operating performance is reviewed by the company and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted  if necessary  by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre bonus profitability for the year 
in those quarters where the estimated annual bonus level changes  the remaining estimated annual bonus is accrued over the remaining quarters as a constant percentage of estimated future pre bonus profitability 
annual bonus levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the company s forecast of pre bonus profitability and competitive employment market conditions 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 income tax expense includes i deferred tax expense  which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and ii current tax expense  which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority plus amounts accrued for expected tax deficiencies including both tax and interest 
accruals for expected tax deficiencies are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when management determines that a tax deficiency is both probable and reasonably estimable 
pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our associates 
under our plans in north america  benefits are based on the number of years of service and the associates compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of service 
the non qualified plan  which exists only in north america  provides for pension benefits that would be covered under the qualified plan but are limited by the internal revenue code 
the non qualified plan has no assets and therefore is an unfunded arrangement 
the benefit liability is reflected on the balance sheet 
the measurement date for the plans is june the disclosures for the uk plan are shown separately because the amounts are material relative to the north america plans and the assumptions used in the plan are significantly different than those used in the north america plans 
under our uk plan  benefits are based on the number of years of service and the associates compensation during the three years before leaving the plan 
the measurement date for the plan is june determination of our obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our pension benefit obligation and related expense 
for this reason  management employs a long term view so that assumptions do not change frequently in response to short term volatility in the economy 
any difference between actual and assumed results is amortized into our pension expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees 
we consider several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions  including economic forecasts  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer comparisons 
north america the following assumptions were used at the end of the past three fiscal years in the valuation of our north american defined benefit pension plans year ended june discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the percent discount rate assumption used at the end of fiscal year is unchanged from fiscal year and represents a basis point increase from the percent discount rate used at the end of fiscal year the company s discount rate assumptions were determined by matching future pension benefit payments with expected future aa bond yields for the same periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption remained percent per annum unchanged from fiscal year and representing basis points lower than the percent rate used in fiscal year selection of the return assumption at percent per annum was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments 
the investment makeup is heavily weighted towards equities which on average provide higher expected returns than other investment vehicles 
the actual return on assets for fiscal year was percent  compared to a return of percent for fiscal year the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the us pension plans change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
the company s us other postretirement employee benefits plan is relatively insensitive to discount rate changes due to the plan provisions that have been established to control costs and as such no sensitivity results are shown in this display 
united kingdom the following assumptions were used at june  and  and july   or the date of the wwllp business combination and the valuation of our uk plan june  june  july  discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the percent discount rate assumption used at the end of fiscal year represents a basis point increase over the rate used at fiscal year and an basis point increase over the discount rate at july  the discount rate is set in relation to yields on aa european corporate bonds at the measurement date and this reduction reflects the increase in yields between these two dates 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption increased to percent from percent per annum for fiscal year the rate of return was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average return expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments which is heavily weighted towards bonds 
the actual return on assets through fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the uk pension plans change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the differences in the discount rate and compensation level assumption used for the north american and uk plans above can be attributed to the differing interest rate environments associated with the currencies and economies to which the plans are subject 
the differences in the expected return on assets are primarily driven by the respective asset allocation in each plan  coupled with the return expectations for assets in the respective currencies 
the north american plans are approximately percent invested in equities  which on average provide a higher return than bonds  which is the favored investment for the uk plans 
incurred but not reported claims the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and reflects consideration of a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions  but excludes the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actual experience with such cases 
management does not currently expect significant fluctuations in the ibnr liability  based on the company s historical claims experience 
however  our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
goodwill and intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for our business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the net assets for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon a multiple of revenue for the reporting unit 
this revenue multiple is based on our experience and knowledge of our own and other transactions in the marketplace 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment would be based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
the impairment expense would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period

interest rates associated with this facility vary with libor and or the prime rate and are based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
we are charged a quarterly commitment fee  currently percent of the facility  which varies with our financial leverage and is paid on the unused portion of the credit facility

we are charged a fee for outstanding letters of credit that also fluctuates based on our leverage ratio 
the company has also provided a million australian dollar denominated letter of credit us million to an australian governmental agency as required by the local regulations 
the estimated fair market value of these letters of credit is immaterial because they have never been used  and the company believes that future usage is remote 
risk management as a part of our overall risk management program  we carry customary commercial insurance policies  including commercial general liability  employment practices liability  and claims made professional liability insurance with a self insured retention of million per claim  which provides coverage for professional liability claims of the company and its subsidiaries  including the cost of defending such claims 
our primary professional liability insurance coverage beyond our self insured retention amount is written by an affiliated captive insurance company pcic owned by us and two other professional services firms 
in formulating its premium structure  pcic estimates the amount it expects to pay for losses and loss expenses for all the members as a whole and then allocates that amount to the member firms based on the individual member s expected losses 
pcic bases premium calculations  which are determined annually based on experience through march of each year  on relative risk of the various lines of business performed by each of the owner companies  past claim experience of each owner company experience rating  growth of each of those companies  industry risk profiles in general and the overall insurance markets 
as of july   the captive insurance company carries reinsurance for losses it insures above million 
our agreements with pcic could require additional payments to pcic in the event that the company decided to exit pcic and adverse claims significantly exceed prior expectations 
if these circumstances were to occur  the company would record a liability at the time it becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
the company will continue to provide for the self insured retention where specific estimated losses and loss expenses for known claims in excess of million are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although the company maintains professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current insurance contracts 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are probable and reasonably estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record its ibnr liability and has a million ibnr liability recorded as of june  insurance market conditions for our industry and the company include increases in overall premium cost 
in addition  beginning in pcic raised the reinsurance attachment point from million to million 
trends toward higher self insured retentions and constraints on aggregate excess coverages for this class of insurance coverage are anticipated to continue or to recur periodically  and to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals 
as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage and we cannot assure that such coverage will continue to be available indefinitely in the event of specific adverse claims experience  adverse loss trends  market capacity constraints or other factors 
in anticipation of the possibility of future reductions in risk transfer from pcic to re insurers  as well as the hardening insurance market conditions in recent years  the firms that own pcic  including the company  have increased pcic s capital in the past and we will continue to re assess capital requirements on a regular basis 
in light of increasing worldwide litigation  including litigation against professionals  the company has implemented a requirement that client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb published statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly  does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not believe the adoption of fas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb published statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans fas  which is an amendment to fas  employers accounting for pensions  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and fas r  revision to fas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and the transition method is prospective 
as a result  the company adopted the provisions of fas for the fiscal year ended june  fas requires companies to recognize the funded status of each of the defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
each over funded plan is recognized as an asset and each under funded plan is recognized as a liability 
the initial impact of the standard  due to unrecognized prior services costs and net actuarial gains and losses as well as subsequent changes in funded status  is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in total shareholders equity  net of applicable income tax 
previous amounts recorded as additional minimum liabilities and related intangible assets are also reversed upon adoption of the new standard 
in accordance with fas  the fiscal year accounting and related disclosures were not affected by the adoption of the new standard

in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statement sab  which provides guidance on how companies should quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that the effect of misstatements that were not corrected at the end of the prior year be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
two techniques were identified as being used by companies in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach 
the rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the misstatement originating in the current year income statement 
thus  this approach ignores the effects of correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior years 
the iron curtain approach quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the cumulative misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origination 
sab permits companies to adjust for the cumulative effect of misstatements relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
prior to the issuance of sab  the company used the rollover method to evaluate the effects of misstatements that were not corrected at the end of the prior year but were determined to be immaterial individually and in the aggregate 
the company adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and performed an evaluation of prior year misstatements under the iron curtain method 
the company concluded that a prior year misstatement would have been material under the iron curtain method 
specifically  the practice by which we value work in process  resulted in the need for a material adjustment to the financial statements under the iron curtain method described above 
as a result  the company has elected  as allowed under sab  to record the effect of initially applying this guidance by adjusting the carrying amount of the impacted accounts as of the beginning of fiscal year and recording an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in fiscal year the following table summarizes the sab cumulative effect adjustment as of july  retained earnings adjustment recorded as of july  decrease increase in thousands valuation of unbilled receivables lease incentives stock based compensation associate expense deferred taxes and taxes payable retained earnings we previously evaluated these misstatements utilizing the roll over approach and concluded that they were insignificant individually and in the aggregate to all periods prior to april  the entries below reflect the impact of recording these misstatements on the iron curtain method 
valuation of unbilled receivables the company s practice in north america associated with the valuation of unbilled receivables has historically been to adjust the net realizable value in conjunction with our billing process  which typically occurs in the month after the unbilled receivables are generated 
thus  each accounting period has contained the valuation adjustments from the previous period  which has resulted in immaterial differences to our income statements over time 
the cumulative impact has resulted in an overstatement of our unbilled receivables that would be material to the company under the iron curtain approach 
in june  the company corrected the unbilled receivables with an adjustment of million  less an income tax effect of million  to the beginning balance of retained earnings at july  lease incentives in february  the sec clarified its view on accounting for leasehold incentives and indicated that the gross method  which requires that leasehold incentives be recorded separately and amortized over the life of the lease  was the only acceptable method of accounting for leasehold incentives 
prior to that time  the company had accounted for leasehold incentives by netting them into the related leasehold improvements the net method 
effective march   the company changed its accounting with regards to leasehold incentives such that incentives associated with any new leases entered into after that date would be amortized separately over the life of the lease or the useful life  whichever is shorter 
since the majority of the company s leases were for terms in excess of the depreciable life of the leasehold improvements  the impact of our using the net method was that the benefits of the leasehold incentives were amortized into the income statement faster than they would have been if amortized over the full term of the leases 
thus at the time of the policy change  our deferred rent liability was understated by the amount of the incentives that had been prematurely amortized into income 
in june  the company corrected this liability with an adjustment of million  less an income tax effect of million  to the beginning balance of retained earnings at july  stock based compensation during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that compensation expense and the related liability associated with one of our stock based compensation plans had erroneously not been recorded for fiscal year in june  the company corrected this liability with an adjustment of million  less an income tax effect of million  to the beginning balance of retained earnings at july  associate expenses the company s associates incur expenses on behalf of the company in fulfillment of their work responsibilities 
submission of these expenses to the company for reimbursement has historically lagged the actual expenditure  typically by a month 
thus  each accounting period has contained the associate expenses from the previous period  which has resulted in immaterial differences to our income statements over time 
in june  the company corrected this misstatement with an adjustment of million  less an income tax effect of million  to the beginning balance of retained earnings at july  deferred taxes and taxes payable as a result of the misstatements previously described  we recorded an increase to deferred income tax as of july  with a corresponding offset to retained earnings to correct these misstatements 
retained earnings represents the net reduction to retained earnings as of july   to reflect the initial application of sab certain of the adjustments included above also resulted in mistatements in the first three quarters of fiscal year we previously evaluated these misstatements utilizing the rollover approach and concluded that these errors were insignificant  individually and in the aggregate  to each of the first three quarters of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange and translation risk 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in mainly short term securities that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
foreign currency risk international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency  as their functional currency 
our primary international operations use the british pound  and to a lesser extent  the euro 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations and may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our condensed consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statement of income 
we consolidate our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation fas 
the results of operations and our financial position will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates
