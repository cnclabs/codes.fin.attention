item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary dynex capital  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a specialty finance company organized as a real estate investment trust reit that invests in loans and securities consisting principally of single family residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we finance these loans and securities through a combination of non recourse securitization financing  repurchase agreements  and equity 
we employ leverage in order to increase the overall yield on our invested capital 
we seek to generate net interest income ie  interest income on investments in excess of the cost of financing these assets  which provides acceptable returns on our invested capital on a risk adjusted basis 
in recent years  we have elected to sell certain non core assets  including investments in manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivable portfolios  as well as to contribute certain of our interests in a commercial mortgage loan securitization trust to a joint venture  in order to reduce our exposure to credit risk on these assets  increase our capital available for new investments  and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our overall leverage 
our emphasis on strengthening the balance sheet and developing investment partnerships  through joint venture and other means  has been in anticipation of redeploying our invested capital in more compelling investment opportunities 
given the continued flat treasury yield curve and the challenging reinvestment environment in traditional mortgage reit investment opportunities  we were not able to make any significant deployments of our capital during the year 
we anticipate that our recently established joint venture with an affiliate of deutsche bank ag and the hiring of sandler o neill should assist us in identifying and gaining access to more compelling investment opportunities in the near future 
we believe that our strategy of not investing our capital when we do not believe there is an adequate risk adjusted return has continued to serve our shareholders well and protect shareholder value 
we have an investment policy which governs the allocation of capital between short term  highly liquid investments  investment grade fixed income investments  subordinate and credit sensitive investments  and strategic investments 
strategic investments are investments in equity and equity like securities of other companies  including other mortgage reits 
we anticipate making additional strategic investments in while using our capital in the interim to pay down recourse debt or to invest only in short term  highly liquid investments 
during  we earned net income of million  and net income to common shareholders of million 
because of differences between gaap income and taxable income  we expect to report taxable income in excess of our book net income but have not yet finalized the tax calculations 
we expect to utilize our tax nol carryforwards to offset any taxable income in excess of the series d preferred stock dividends paid during that we would otherwise be required to distribute and not to make any distribution to common shareholders 
on january   we redeemed  shares of the series d preferred stock  which represented approximately of the then outstanding shares  for approximately million in cash  which represented a redemption price of per share and  of preferred dividends that had accrued on those shares through the redemption date 
we also began repurchasing our common shares during the first quarter of under the stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors 
we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock during at an average cost of per share and may repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current board authorization 
subject to the applicable securities laws and the terms of the series d preferred stock designation  future repurchases of common stock will be made at times and in amounts as the company deems appropriate and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
during  we entered into a joint venture with an affiliate of deutsche bank  ag in connection with the formation of the joint venture  we contributed our interests in million of securitized finance receivables backed by commercial mortgage loans which had been pledged to a trust and secured million in securitization financing 
as a result of the contribution  we derecognized these amounts from our consolidated balance sheet  and recognized a loss of million on the transfer of our interests  which had a fair value of approximately million when contributed  to the joint venture 
also in connection with the formation of the joint venture  we agreed to remit cash flows that we receive on an additional million in securitized finance receivables  which collateralizes million in securitization financing  by recording an investment in the joint venture and a corresponding liability of million on the date of contribution to reflect this commitment 
the million in securitized finance receivables and the million in securitization financing will continue to be carried in our financial statements 
in return for the contributions discussed above  we received a interest in the joint venture  an amount equal to that received by the deutsche bank affiliate 
our aggregate initial investment in the joint venture was million 
we view this joint venture as a means of diversifying our risk in the investments contributed to the joint venture  and also as a means of partnering on equal terms with a much larger organization  which has greater resources and capital and access to more investment opportunities than we currently do 
we believe that we have largely completed our efforts to diversify our investment portfolio and do not currently anticipate any additional significant asset sales 
financial condition comparative balance sheet information is set forth in the tables below december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments securitized finance receivables investment in joint venture securities other investments other loans securitization financing repurchase agreements obligation under payment agreement shareholders equity book value per common share inclusive of preferred stock liquidation preference securitized finance receivables securitized finance receivables include loans secured by single family residential and commercial mortgage properties 
securitized finance receivables decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of derecognition of million of receivables which were contributed to a joint venture and principal repayments of million 
principal repayments resulted from normal principal amortization of the underlying loan and loan prepayments due to the favorable interest rate and real estate environment 
investment in joint venture we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of deutsche bank  ag in which we have a interest during the third quarter of as discussed above  in exchange for our interest in the joint venture  we contributed our interests in one pool of commercial mortgage loans and executed an agreement with the joint venture that requires us to remit the cash flows we receive on our interests in a second pool of commercial mortgage loans to the joint venture 
our initial investment in joint venture upon its formation was million  which has been reduced by million for our proportionate share of the joint venture s losses through december  the joint venture s loss was primarily related to an impairment charge recorded on its investment in commercial mortgage backed securities 
securities securities are predominantly investment grade single family residential agency and non agency mortgage securities 
securities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily as a result of the receipt of principal payments of million 
other investments other investments at december  and consist primarily of a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables and the related real estate owned 
other investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease of million resulted from payments of million received in and applied against the carrying value of the investment and the sale of million of related real estate owned 
securitization financing non recourse securitization financing decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of the derecognition of million of non recourse securitization financing as a result of the contribution of the associated securitized finance receivables to the joint venture  principal payments of million  and premium amortization of approximately million 
repurchase agreements during  we made net payments of million on the repurchase agreement borrowings resulting in a balance of million at december  obligation under payment agreement our obligation under payment agreement relates to our entry into an agreement that requires us to remit the cash flows we receive on our interests in a commercial mortgage loan securitization trust to the joint venture 
we contributed this agreement to the joint venture as part of its initial capitalization in exchange for a portion of our interest in the joint venture and recorded a liability of million upon its contribution 
the change in the balance from the contribution date to december  was a result of payments made to the joint venture under the agreement of thousand less the amortization of the related discount 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of of the then outstanding shares of series d preferred stock during the first quarter of for million  the repurchase of of common stock and dividends declared on the shares of series d preferred stock of million 
these decreases were offset by net income of million  and a change in accumulated other comprehensive income of million on certain available for sale investments 
supplemental discussion of investments we evaluate and manage our investment portfolio in large part based on our net capital invested in that particular investment 
net capital invested is generally defined as the cost basis of the investment net of the associated financing for that investment 
for securitized finance receivables  because the securitization financing is recourse only to the finance receivables pledged and is  therefore  not our general obligation  the risk on our investment in securitized finance receivables from an economic point of view is limited to our net retained investment in the securitization trust 
below is the net basis of our investments as of december  included in the table is an estimate of the fair value of our net investment 
the fair value of our net investment in securitized finance receivables is based on the present value of the projected cash flow from the collateral  adjusted for the impact and assumed level of future prepayments and credit losses  less the projected principal and interest due on the securitization financing bonds owned by third parties 
the fair value of securities is based on quotes obtained from third party dealers  or  as is the case for the majority of our investments  calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows at market rates 
for securities and other investments  we may employ leverage to enhance our overall returns on our net capital invested in these particular assets 
december  amounts in thousands amortized cost basis financing net basis fair value of net basis securitized finance receivables single family mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans allowance for loan losses securities investment grade single family non investment grade single family equity and other investment in joint venture obligation under payment agreement other loans and investments net unrealized gain total fair values for securitized finance receivables and the obligation under payment agreement are based on discounted cash flows using assumptions set forth in the table below  inclusive of amounts invested in redeemed securitization financing bonds 
fair values of securities are based on dealer quotes  if available 
where dealer quotes are not available  fair values are calculated as the net present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at 
expected cash flows for both securitized finance receivables and securities were based on the forward libor curve as of december   and incorporate the resetting of the interest rates on the adjustable rate assets to a level consistent with projected prevailing rates 
increases or decreases in interest rates and index levels from those used would impact the calculation of fair value  as would differences in actual prepayment speeds and credit losses versus the assumptions set forth above 
fair value for investment in joint venture represents dynex s share of the joint assets valued using methodologies and assumptions consistent with note above 
the following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating fair value for our net investment in securitized finance receivables and the cash flow related to those net investments during fair value assumptions loan type weighted average prepayment speeds losses weighted average discount rate projected cash flow termination date amounts in thousands cash flows single family mortgage loans cpr annually anticipated final maturity commercial mortgage loans annually represents the excess of the cash flows received on the collateral pledged over the cash flow required to service the related securitization financing 
includes loans pledged to two different securitization trusts 
assumed cpr speeds generally are governed by underlying pool characteristics  prepayment lock out provisions  and yield maintenance provisions 
loans currently delinquent in excess of days are assumed liquidated in six months at a loss amount that is calculated for each loan based on its specific facts 
cash flow termination dates are modeled based on the repayment dates of the loans or optional redemption dates of the underlying securitization financing bonds 
represents management s estimate of the market discount rate that would be used by a third party in valuing these or similar assets 
the following table presents the net basis of investments included in the estimated fair value of net investment table above by their rating classification 
investments in the unrated and non investment grade classification primarily include other loans that have not been given a rating but that are substantially seasoned and performing loans 
securitization over collateralization generally includes the excess of the securitized finance receivable collateral pledged over the outstanding bonds issued by the securitization trust 
december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents investments aaa rated and agency mbs fixed income securities aa and a rated fixed income securities unrated and non investment grade securitization over collateralization investment in joint venture supplemental discussion of common equity book value we believe that our shareholders  as well as shareholders of other companies in the mortgage reit industry  consider book value per common share an important measure 
our reported book value per common share is based on the carrying value our assets and liabilities as recorded in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a substantial portion of our assets are carried on a historical  or amortized  cost basis and not at estimated fair value 
the table included in the supplemental discussion of investments section above compares the amortized cost basis of our investments to their estimated fair value based on assumptions set forth in the table 
we believe that book value per common share  adjusted to reflect the carrying value of investments at their fair value hereinafter referred to as adjusted common equity book value  is also a meaningful measure for our shareholders  representing effectively our estimated going concern value 
the following table calculates adjusted common equity book value and adjusted common equity book value per share using the estimated fair value information contained in the estimated fair value of net investment table above 
the amounts set forth in the table in the adjusted common equity book value column include all of our assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values  and exclude any value attributable to our tax net operating loss carryforwards and other matters that might impact our value

these decreases in net income were partially offset by a million decrease in recapture of provision for loan losses  a decrease in impairment charges of million  and a million decrease in general and administrative expenses 
net income to common shareholders decreased by million in from million in to million in the decrease in net income to common shareholders was due to the above mentioned decrease in net income of million  offset by a decrease in preferred stock charge of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million  or  from million for the same period in this decline is a result of a decline in average interest earning assets  primarily related to the derecognition of million of securitized finance receivables and the related securitization financing as a result of the contribution of our interests in a pool of commercial mortgage loans to a joint venture during this decline in average interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
net interest spread on non cash investments increased to in from in the increase in net interest spread is due to unexpected prepayment of commercial loans in and interest rates on single family loans that reset during while rates on the associated financing remained flat during the year 
see further discussion below as to changes in the net interest spread on our investment portfolio during net interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of a decline in the provision for loan losses of million from to the decrease in provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in reserves in for a large commercial loan that became delinquent in  whereas  there were no new significant delinquent commercial loans in there was a small amount provided for loan losses on single family loans of million during as these loans continue to season 
impairment charges decreased from million in to million in impairment charges for included million on a debt security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables 
we recognized a loss of million for on the capitalization of a joint venture related to our contribution of a commercial loan securitization to the joint venture  and the creation of an obligation under payment agreement in connection with the formation of the joint venture as discussed above under financial condition 
the contribution of our interests in this securitization resulted in the derecognition of approximately million of securitized finance receivables and million of related securitization financing 
general and administrative expense decreased by million from million to million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased during primarily due to a reduction of million in legal and litigation expenses defending ourselves in various suits and a decrease in salary and benefits related to reductions in staffing at our tax lien servicing operation in pennsylvania 
we reported a preferred stock charge of million for the year ended december   which represents an decrease of million from the million reported for the year ended december  the preferred stock charge for decreased due to the redemption of  shares of series d preferred stock in january  which represented of the then outstanding shares of such stock  which is the only class of our preferred stock outstanding 
compared to net income increased in by million  to million in from a loss of million in  as a result of a decrease in provision for loan losses of million  decreased impairment charges of million  decreased general and administrative expenses of million and million of other income 
these increases in income were partially offset by a decrease of net interest income of million and a decrease in gain on sales of investments of million 
net income to common shareholders increased by million in  from a loss of million in to income of million in the increase in net income to common shareholders was due to increased net income of million  offset by an increase in preferred stock charges of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in net interest income decreased million  or  as a result of a decline in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets decreased in due to the sale of investments  including million of securitized finance receivables  million of equity securities and million of other loans 
net interest spread was in versus in  and decreased in as a result of sales and prepayments of higher coupon assets  the proceeds of which have been reinvested in lower yielding cash equivalents  and also decreased due in part to increasing borrowing costs from both increasing libor rates and repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
see further discussion below as to changes in the net interest spread on our investment portfolio during net interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of the decline of the provision for loan losses in compared to of million 
provision for loan losses decreased to million in  from million in the decrease of million from was primarily due to the sale in late and early of our investment in manufactured housing loans 
provision for manufactured housing loan losses decreased by million in while commercial and single family loan loss reserve provisions increased by million and million  respectively 
impairment charges decreased from million in to million in impairment charges for included million on manufactured housing loan securities and million on delinquent property tax receivable securities 
no impairment charges were recorded on manufactured housing securities as a result of their sale in impairment charges in included million on a debt security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables 
gain on sale of investments for resulted primarily from a net gain of million recognized on the sale of our interests in securitization trusts collateralized primarily by manufactured housing loans and securities backed by manufactured housing loans  for cash proceeds of million 
the sale of our interests in those securitizations resulted in the de recognition of approximately million of securitized finance receivables and million of related securitization financing 
we also recorded a gain of million on the sale of approximately million in mezzanine loans for net proceeds of million 
general and administrative expense decreased by million from million to million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased during with the sale in october of the ohio delinquent property tax receivable servicing operation and through continued downsizing in the operation 
general and administrative expenses in included million of litigation related expenses versus million in general and administrative expenses in included approximately increase in professional fees related to the audit of our financial statements and the subsequent termination of our independent accounting firm 
we reported a preferred stock charge of million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million from the million reported for the year ended december  preferred stock charge for includes a full year s dividend on the series d preferred stock 
in  dividends on the preferred stock outstanding was partially offset by the preferred stock benefit resulting from the recapitalization completed in average balances and effective interest rates the following table summarizes the average balances of interest earning assets and their average effective yields  along with the average interest bearing liabilities and the related average effective interest rates  for each of the periods presented 
assets that are on non accrual status are excluded from the table below for each period presented

average balances exclude funds held by trustees of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
effective rates are calculated excluding non interest related non recourse securitization financing expenses and provision for credit losses 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  increased to basis points from basis points for the year ended december  this increase in the net interest spread is due to non recurring income on liquidated and delinquent commercial loans in in addition during  the increases in the average rate on the securitization financing  which were financing variable rate single family loans  slowed while interest rates on the loans reset higher during the year  which helped increase the net interest spread 
the overall yield on interest earning assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in primarily as a result of an increase of approximately basis points in the weighted average coupon on our securitized single family mortgage loans  the majority of which have an adjustable rate based on libor  and as a result of the derecognition of million in commercial mortgage loans contributed to a joint venture during the effective rate on interest bearing liabilities increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates 
approximately of our interest bearing liabilities reprice monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for the effect of increasing market rates was muted by the derecognition of approximately million of non recourse securitization financing  which was financing a pool of commercial mortgage loans our interests in which were contributed to a joint venture 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to basis points from basis points for the year ended december  this decrease in the net interest spread is due to declining yields on interest earning assets  due principally to decreased interest income as a result of the sale of approximately million of securitized finance receivables during the second quarter of and the sale of approximately million in receivables during the fourth quarter of the net interest spread contribution for the receivables sold was basis points and basis points for the three and twelve month periods ended december  and basis points and basis points  respectively during the three and twelve month periods ended december  the proceeds from the sale of these investments have generally been invested in cash and short term securities 
in addition during  the securitization financing that backed variable rate single family loans was replaced with libor based repurchase agreement financing  which is recourse to us  and which carries a weighted average spread to libor of basis points 
the securitization financing had an effective spread to libor of basis points 
the net interest spread reflects the reduce yield on increased investments in cash and cash equivalents and also reflects the amortization of premiums and discounts on both the assets and the liabilities 
the overall yield on interest earnings assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the overall yield declined by basis points as higher rate loans continued to be prepaid during the period 
in addition to declining asset yields  interest bearing liability costs increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates  including libor rates  and the repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
approximately of our interest bearing liabilities re price monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for rates and volume the following table summarizes the amount of change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates versus changes in volume to to amounts in thousands rate volume total rate volume total securitized finance receivables other interest bearing assets total interest income securitization financing senior notes repurchase agreements total interest expense net interest income note the change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate 
this table excludes non interest related securitization financing expense  other interest expense and provision for credit losses 
credit exposures as discussed in item a risk factors above  the predominate risk in our investment portfolio today is credit risk ie  the risk that we will not receive all amounts contractually due us on an investment as a result of a default by the borrower and the resulting deficiency in proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral securing the obligation 
in many instances  we retained the first loss credit risk on pools of loans and securities that we have securitized 
in addition to our retained interests in certain securitizations  we also have credit risk on approximately million of unrated or non investment grade securities and loans 
the following table summarizes the aggregate principal amount of our investments in securitized finance receivables and subordinate securities  the direct credit exposure retained by us from those investments represented by the amount of over collateralization pledged and subordinated securities owned by us  net of the credit reserves and discounts maintained by us for such exposure  and the actual credit losses incurred for each year 
our credit exposure  net of credit reserves has sequentially decreased from year to year as a result of the sale and derecognition of investments  and as a result of additional provisions for loan losses on loans where we have credit risk 
from to  we sold assets or assets were otherwise paid down by million  resulting in the reduction of our credit exposure by million 
credit reserves and actual credit losses amounts in millions outstanding loan principal balance credit exposure  net of credit reserves actual credit losses credit exposure  net of credit reserves to outstanding loan balance delinquencies as a percentage of all outstanding securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to at december  from at december  primarily as a result of certain commercial loans that were delinquent in being paid off during and the continued strong performance of the residential real estate market 
we monitor and evaluate our exposure to credit losses and have established reserves based upon anticipated losses  general economic conditions and trends in the investment portfolio 
at december   management believes the level of credit reserves is appropriate for currently existing losses 
the following tables summarize single family mortgage loan and commercial mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding commercial securitized finance receivables balance for those securities in which we have retained a portion of the direct credit risk 
single family mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance increased by approximately to at december  from at december  the increase in delinquencies occurred in loans whose losses are covered by pool insurance  while delinquencies on non pool insured loans actually decreased from to single family loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total for commercial mortgage loans  the delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to at december  from at december  primarily due to eight delinquent commercial loans which resolved during and the derecognition of one of our three commercial mortgage loan securitizations also in which had two significant delinquent loans at december  commercial mortgage loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total includes foreclosures and real estate owned 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
consolidation of subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements represent our accounts after the elimination of inter company transactions 
we consolidate entities in which we own more than of the voting equity and control of the entity does not rest with others 
we follow the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than and less than a interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures or when we are able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee but own less than of the voting equity 
for all other investments  the cost method is applied 
securitization 
we have securitized loans and securities in a securitization financing transaction by transferring financial assets to a wholly owned trust  and the trust issues non recourse bonds pursuant to an indenture 
generally  we retain some form of control over the transferred assets  and or the trust is not deemed to be a qualified special purpose entity 
in instances where the trust is deemed not to be a qualified special purpose entity  the trust is included in our consolidated financial statements 
a transfer of financial assets in which we surrender control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
for accounting and tax purposes  the loans and securities financed through the issuance of bonds in a securitization financing transaction are treated as our assets  and the associated bonds issued are treated as our debt as securitization financing 
we may retain certain of the bonds issued by the trust  and we generally will transfer collateral in excess of the bonds issued 
this excess is typically referred to as over collateralization 
each securitization trust generally provides us with the right to redeem  at our option  the remaining outstanding bonds prior to their maturity date 
impairments 
we evaluate all securities in our investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
a security is generally defined to be other than temporarily impaired if  for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters  the carrying value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and we estimate  based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants  that the fair value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  we record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated fair value 
in certain instances  as a result of the other than temporary impairment analysis  the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non accrual status 
we consider an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its recorded cost basis 
impairments of other investments are generally considered to be other than temporary when the fair value remains below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated value 
allowance for loan losses 
we have credit risk on loans pledged in securitization financing transactions and classified as securitized finance receivables in our investment portfolio 
an allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently existing probable losses 
factors considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance are a current period expense to operations 
single family loans are considered impaired when they are days past due 
commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
generally  a commercial loan with a debt service coverage ratio of less than one is considered impaired 
however  based on a commercial loan s details  commercial loans with a debt service ratio less than one may not be considered impaired  conversely  commercial loans with a debt service coverage ratio greater than one may be considered impaired 
certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered by loan guarantees that limit our exposure on these loans 
the level of allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount of applicable loan guarantees 
our actual credit losses may differ from the estimates used to establish the allowance 
low income housing tax credit lihtc properties account for of dynex s commercial loan portfolio 
section of the tax code provides tax credits to investors in projects to construct or substantially rehabilitate properties that provide housing for qualifying low income families 
property owners must comply with income and rental restrictions over a minimum year compliance period and in return  they are entitled to receive a tax credit of to a dollar for dollar reduction of federal taxes for each taxable year over a period of years 
if a property owner fails to maintain compliance with the tax credit restrictions  the owner would face the partial recapture of tax credits already taken 
in addition  a property owner is incented to support poorly performing properties because a default on a mortgage loan that leads to a foreclosure would result in the prior owner losing any future tax credits and the recapture of any tax credits already taken 
for these reasons  we believe that qualifying tax credit properties will be supported by the property owner through its year compliance period 
these properties are monitored and loan loss reserve requirements reflect any poorly performing property which is nearing the end of that compliance period 
loans on lihtc properties account for approximately  of the  of commercial loan collateral 
the deal structures in which the lihtc loans reside maintain an interest in the properties covered by the loan 
possible loan losses would be mitigated by the value of the underlying collateral 
all commercial loan properties are monitored for performance and loan loss provisions are made for those loans that are considered to be likely to incur a loss 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a variety of sources 
our primary source of funding for our operations today is the cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  which includes net interest income and principal payments and prepayments on these investments 
from the cash flow on our investment portfolio  we fund our operating overhead costs  including the servicing of our delinquent property tax receivables  pay the dividend on the series d preferred stock and service the remaining recourse debt 
our investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by us for reinvestment or other purposes 
we have primarily utilized our cash flow during to pay down repurchase agreement financing and redeem a portion of our series d preferred stock 
relative to others in our industry  our capital base is less leveraged  and we have much greater financial flexibility and resources 
the cash flow from our investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively  excluding proceeds from the sales of investments and the above refunding of repurchase agreements 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated securitization financing ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
we also sold investments in which generated net cash proceeds of million 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets and assuming that short term interest rates remain stable  we anticipate that  absent reinvestment of our capital in higher yielding investments  the cash flow from our investment portfolio will continue to decline in compared to as the investment portfolio continues to pay down 
we do  however  anticipate  that we will have sufficient cash flow from our investment portfolio to meet all of our obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
our cash flow from our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
we currently have a substantial portion of our available capital invested in cash or highly liquid  short term instruments 
at december   this amount was million  which represents a significant portion of our overall equity capital base 
we intend to maintain high levels of liquidity for the foreseeable future given the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities as a result of the absolute low level of interest rates  the flat yield curve  and the historically tight spreads on fixed income instruments 
we redeemed of our series d preferred stock in january this redemption reduced the series d preferred stock outstanding by approximately million  saving us approximately million in dividends annually 
the board of directors of dynex also approved the redemption of up to one million shares of common stock of dynex upon completion of the redemption of the series d preferred stock 
we may also redeem additional shares of our common stock if alternative uses of the capital are not available and if accretive to book value per common share 
through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  we have issued non recourse debt in the form of non recourse securitization financing to fund the majority of our investment portfolio 
the obligations under the securitization financing are payable solely from the securitized finance receivables and are otherwise non recourse to us 
the maturity of each class of securitization financing is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral and is not subject to margin call risk 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   we have million of non recourse securitization financing outstanding  all of which carries a fixed rate of interest 
in  securitization financing bonds were redeemed with cash and repurchase agreement financing secured by the bonds 
as a result of paydowns on the associated securitized finance receivables  the remaining balance of the securitization financing bonds at the end of was million  which was financed with cash of million and repurchase agreement financing of approximately million 
as the redeemed bonds have not been legally extinguished  we could reissue these bonds  generating estimated proceeds in excess of million  which would be used to repay the repurchase agreement financing  and the balance of which would increase our cash and cash equivalents 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table shows expected cash payments on our contractual obligations as of december  for the following time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations non recourse securitization financing repurchase agreements operating lease obligations mortgage servicing obligations obligation under payment agreement total as the master servicer for certain of the series of non recourse securitization financing securities which we have issued  and certain loans which have been securitized but for which we are not the master servicer  we have an obligation to advance scheduled principal and interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying servicing agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance 
such advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they are made  or shortly thereafter  and the contractual obligation with respect to these advances is excluded from the above table 
amounts presented for long term debt obligations include estimated principal and interest on the related obligations 
securitization financing is non recourse to us as the bonds are payable solely from loans and securities pledged as securitized finance receivables 
payments due by period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast for the underlying loans and securities  substantially all of which is used to repay the associated securitization financing outstanding 
we entered an agreement to contribute to a joint venture all of the net cashflows from our interests in a pool of securitized commercial mortgage loans 
by agreement  the joint venture is scheduled to dissolve no later than off balance sheet arrangements we do not believe that any off balance sheet arrangements exist that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

the decrease in net income during the third quarter of relates primarily to loss of approximately million recognized on the transfer of million of commercial mortgage loans to a joint venture and the derecognition of the related non recourse securitization financing of million 
the negative net interest spread on interest earning assets resulted from the impact of certain commercial loans being on non accrual and an increase in amortization expense related to deferred costs on our commercial securitizations resulting from higher than anticipated prepayments on those securitizations

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by dynex that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements contained in this item as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report addressing the results of operations  our operating performance  events  or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to investment strategies  net interest income growth  earnings or earnings per share growth  and market share  as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based upon management s views and assumptions as of the date of this report  regarding future events and operating performance and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
dynex cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following reinvestment 
asset yields today are generally lower than those assets sold or repaid  due to lower overall interest rates and more competition for these assets as investment assets have repaid or been sold 
we have generally been unable to find investments which have acceptable risk adjusted yields 
as a result  our net interest income has been declining  and may continue to decline in the future  resulting in lower earnings per share over time 
in order to maintain our investment portfolio size and our earnings  we need to reinvest a portion of the cash flows we receive into new interest earning assets 
if we are unable to find suitable reinvestment opportunities  the net interest income on our investment portfolio and investment cash flows could be negatively impacted 
economic conditions 
we are affected by general economic conditions 
an increase in the risk of defaults and credit risk resulting from an economic slowdown or recession could result in a decrease in the value of our investments and the over collateralization associated with its securitization transactions 
as a result of our being heavily invested in short term high quality investments  a worsening economy  however  could also benefit us by creating opportunities for us to invest in assets that become distressed as a result of the worsening conditions 
these changes could have an effect on our financial performance and the performance on our securitized loan pools 
investment portfolio cash flow 
cash flows from the investment portfolio fund our operations  the preferred stock dividend  and repayments of outstanding debt  and are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses  particularly given the high degree of internal structural leverage inherent in our securitized investments 
based on the performance of the underlying assets within the securitization structure  cash flows which may have otherwise been paid to us as a result of our ownership interest may be retained within the structure 
cash flows from the investment portfolio are likely to sequentially decline until we meaningfully begin to reinvest our capital 
there can be no assurances that we will find suitable investment alternatives for our capital  nor can there be assurances that we will meet our reinvestment and return hurdles 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from our estimates or exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from our estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar balance loans  and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact on our financial results 
such impact may include higher provisions for loan losses and reduced interest income if the loan is placed on non accrual 
interest rate fluctuations 
our income and cash flow depends on our ability to earn greater interest on our investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by us generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
approximately million of our investments  including loans and securities currently pledged as securitized finance receivables and securities  are fixed rate and approximately million of our investments are variable rate 
we currently finance these fixed rate assets through million of fixed rate securitization financing and million of variable rate repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
third party servicers 
our loans and loans underlying securities are serviced by third party service providers 
as with any external service provider  we are subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services 
many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
a substantial increase in our delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or loan performance in general could harm our ability to securitize our real estate loans in the future and may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
our exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yielding investments 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market in which we compete with a number of institutions with greater financial resources 
in purchasing portfolio investments and in issuing securities  we compete with other mortgage reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  commercial banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  federal agencies and other entities  many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do 
increased competition in the market and our competitors greater financial resources have adversely affected dynex  and may continue to do so 
competition may also continue to keep pressure on spreads resulting in us being unable to reinvest our capital on an acceptable risk adjusted basis 
regulatory changes 
our businesses as of and for the year ended december  were not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect us and the performance of our securitized loan pools or our ability to collect on our delinquent property tax receivables 
we are a reit and are required to meet certain tests in order to maintain our reit status as described in the earlier discussion of federal income tax considerations 
if we should fail to maintain our reit status  we would not be able to hold certain investments and would be subject to income taxes 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that we will be required to be compliant with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of as of december  failure to be compliant may result in doubt in the capital markets about the quality and adequacy of our internal disclosure controls 
this could result in our having difficulty in or being unable to raise additional capital in these markets in order to finance our operations and future investments 
other 
the following risks  which are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors above  could also affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows our ownership of certain subordinate interests in securitization trusts subjects us to credit risk on the underlying loans  and we provide for loss reserves on these loans as required under gaap 
certain investments employ internal structural leverage as a result of the securitization process  and are in the most subordinate position in the capital structure  which magnifies the potential impact of adverse events on our cash flows and reported results 
our efforts to manage credit risk may not be successful in limiting delinquencies and defaults in underlying loans or losses on our investments 
we may be unable to invest in new assets with attractive yields  and yields on new assets in which we do invest may not generate attractive yields  resulting in a decline in our earnings per share over time 
prepayments of principal on our investments  and the timing of prepayments  may impact our reported earnings and our cash flows 
we finance a portion of our investment portfolio with short term recourse repurchase agreements which subjects us to margin calls if the assets pledged subsequently decline in value 
we may be subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services from third party service providers  which may harm our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us  and could lead to reduced earnings and or increased earnings volatility 
our reported income depends on accounting conventions and assumptions about the future that may change 
failure to qualify as a reit would adversely affect our dividend distributions and could adversely affect the value of our securities 
maintaining reit status may reduce our flexibility to manage our operations 
we may fail to properly conduct our operations so as to avoid falling under the definition of an investment company pursuant to the investment company act of we are dependent on certain key personnel 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments  and certain other items  at fair value 
sfas applies to reporting periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact on adoption of sfas in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and all interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is permitted provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued interim or annual financial statements for that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new fasb standard also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning december  the company does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments  an amendment to sfas and sfas among other things  sfas i permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  ii clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas  iii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iv clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and v amends sfas to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued  or subject to a remeasurement new basis event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after september  at initial application of sfas  the fair value election provided for in paragraph c may be applied for hybrid financial instruments that were bifurcated under paragraph of sfas prior to the initial application of sfas in january  the fasb provided a scope exception under sfas for securitized interests that only contain an embedded derivative that is tied to the prepayment risk of the underlying prepayable financial assets  and for which the investor does not control the right to accelerate the settlement 
if a securitized interest contains any other embedded derivative for example  an inverse floater  then it would be subject to the bifurcation tests in sfas  as would securities purchased at a significant premium 
following the issuance of the scope exception by the fasb  changes in the market value of the company s investment securities would continue to be made through other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the company does not expect that the january  adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  to the extent that certain of the company s future investments in securitized financial assets do not meet the scope exception adopted by the fasb  the company s future results of operations may exhibit volatility if such investments are required to be bifurcated or marked to market value in their entirety through the income statement  depending on the election made by the company 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements 
the sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors 
the requirements of sab are effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the company s adoption of sab during the year ended december  had no impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of our earnings and cash flows 
we are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of our interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
we monitor the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and estimated market value of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
we focus on the sensitivity of our investment portfolio cash flow  and measure such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
we estimate our net interest income cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december  once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
cash flow changes from interest rate swaps  caps  floors or any other derivative instrument are included in this analysis 
the following table summarizes our net interest income cash flow and market value sensitivity analyses as of december  these analyses represent management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow and value expressed as a percentage change of shareholders equity  given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not considered interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting our portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio  and no change to our liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
projected change in net interest margin cash flow from base case projected change in value  expressed as a percentage of shareholders equity basis point increase decrease in interest rates excluding cash and cash equivalents including cash and cash equivalents base our interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates and to the level of short term interest rates 
approximately million of our investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
approximately million of our investment portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately  and of the adjustable rate loans underlying our securitized finance receivables are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor  one year constant maturity treasury rate cmt and prime rate  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  our net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i fixed rate loans and investments financed with variable rate debt  ii the lag in resets of the adjustable rate loans underlying the securitized finance receivables relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings  and iii rate resets on the adjustable rate loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as to item i  we have substantially limited our interest rate risk by match funding fixed rate assets and variable rate assets 
as to items ii and iii  as short term interest rates stabilize and the adjustable rate loans reset  the net interest margin may be partially restored as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to market conditions 
net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that we have entered into such agreements
