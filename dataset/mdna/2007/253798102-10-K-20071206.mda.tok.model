item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in the communications technology industry  which is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
we compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features  company reputation  brand recognition  technical support  relationships with partners  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price and availability 
we help customers connect  monitor  and control local or remote electronic devices over a network or via the internet 
we continue to leverage a common core technology base to develop and provide innovative connectivity solutions to our customers 
core technology is used across product lines to provide additional functionality for customers  allowing them to get to market with network enabled devices faster 
we have positioned ourselves in the growing market of integrated hardware and software connectivity solutions to network enable the coming generation of intelligent devices in commercial applications 
our revenues consist of products that are in non embedded and embedded product groupings 
the non embedded products include serial cards  serial servers  usb connected products  cellular routers  cellular gateway products  network management software  console servers  remote display products  wireless communications adapters  and cameras and sensors 
embedded products include chips  modules  single board computers  network interface cards nics and software and development tools 
our non embedded serial cards and our embedded nics are in the mature phase of their product life cycles 
our strategy is to focus on key applications  customers and markets to efficiently manage the migration from products that are in the mature phase of their product life cycles to other newer technologies 
during  we announced a new solution category called drop in networking 
drop in networking provides end to end wireless access to electronic devices in places where wires will not work or cannot be used 
incorporating products from both our embedded and non embedded categories  including modules  wireless communications adapters  cellular routers  gateways  sensors  and network management software  drop in networking holds the potential to economically extend network connectivity to millions of new devices 
for applications in energy management  building control  manufacturing  supply chain management and a host of others  drop in networking products provide a non intrusive way to connect devices anywhere they reside 
devices are being connected that were previously not networked  such as irrigation controls for farms and golf courses  fish farm monitoring equipment and fitness equipment to name a few 
our innovations in drop in networking enable our customers to differentiate their products  provide better customer service  and frequently create new revenue streams 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant increase in cash incentive compensation expenses compared to fiscal due to higher achievement of our financial incentive compensation targets 
executive cash incentive compensation is principally based on earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization ebtda  revenue and cash balances  while employee cash incentive compensation is tied to ebtda  revenue  and achievement of individual goals

net sales of maxstream branded products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  which includes two months of revenue from the date of acquisition of july  net sales of all other products  except serial cards and nics  increased by million  or 
net sales of serial cards  which are a non embedded product  and nics  which are an embedded product  decreased by million  or 
serial cards are in a mature market that is declining at a rate of approximately per year 
serial cards net sales represented of total net sales for fiscal nics are at the end of their product life cycle and represented less than of our net sales for fiscal the net sales increase from to was million  or 
net sales of products acquired as a result of the fs forth  rabbit  and maxstream acquisitions  which are primarily embedded products  increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of all other products  except serial cards and nics  increased by million  or in fiscal net sales of serial cards  which are a non embedded product  and nics  which are an embedded product  decreased by million  or as serial cards are declining and nics approach the end of their product life cycle 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales continued a shift in the customer and product mix has resulted in a slight decrease in our average selling price of our products as we are selling more embedded products as a percentage of total net sales 
embedded products generally have a lower average selling price than non embedded products 
fluctuation in foreign currency rates compared to the prior year s rates had a favorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal  an unfavorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal and a favorable impact on net sales of million in fiscal net sales by products our revenue is generated from two product groupings non embedded and embedded 
the following table presents our revenue by product grouping net sales of net sales in millions non embedded embedded total non embedded our non embedded products net sales increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in sales of serial servers  usb connected products  wireless communication adapters and gateways  partially offset by the continuing sales decline of serial cards 
our non embedded products net sales decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal product introductions generated an increase in net sales of network connected products  usb and gateways  partially offsetting the continuing sales decline of serial cards 
embedded embedded products net sales increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in net sales of embedded modules and single board computers was partially offset by the continued decline of the nic sales 
embedded products net sales increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of rabbit  fs forth and maxstream embedded products increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal introduction of new embedded modules and microprocessors  as well as new customers reaching production volumes  partially offset the continuing decline of nic sales in fiscal net sales by distribution channels our revenue is generated from these distribution channels direct oems and distributors 
the following table presents our revenue by channel net sales of net sales in millions direct oem channel distribution channel total company 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales continued the increase in direct oem channel net sales during the last three fiscal years was primarily due to our continued enhancement of our product offerings through the acquisitions of rabbit and maxstream  whose customers are primarily oems  and our decision to sell directly to certain customers rather than through the distribution channel 
the increase in the distribution channel net sales over the last three fiscal years was primarily due to our continued focus on maintaining our channel strategy  which includes employing additional channel partners and releasing complementary products 
net sales by geographic area our revenue by geographic location of our customers is as follows net sales of net sales in millions international united states total company the increase in net sales in the united states was primarily due to incremental net sales resulting from the maxstream and rabbit acquisitions  continued market penetration and new customer volume increases 
net sales in the united states  as a percent of total net sales  has increased over the past two years  while the percentage of international net sales as a percent of total net sales has decreased 
this is a result of the customer base for maxstream and rabbit being comprised of a larger proportion of united states customers compared to international customers 
however  we expect that in the future our international net sales will grow more quickly as a percent of total net sales than our united states net sales 
gross profit compared to gross profit margin for was compared to for the decrease in gross profit margin is primarily a result of product and customer mix changes related to the increase in embedded net sales 
this was offset by an increase in gross profit margin of due to reduced amortization of purchased and core technology since some of this technology became fully amortized in amortization of purchased and core technology was million or in fiscal as compared to million or in fiscal compared to gross profit margin for was compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to product mix changes among products within both the embedded and non embedded product groups  as well as higher manufacturing expenses 
amortization of purchased and core technology was million or in fiscal as compared to million or in fiscal operating expenses compared to operating expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to operating expenses of million in the incremental operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of maxstream on july  provided an additional million of operating expenses  which was offset by a million charge for in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating expenses continued connection with the acquisition of maxstream 
compensation related expenses  including salaries and cash incentive compensation and stock based compensation  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in employees  merit increases and a higher level of cash incentive compensation achievement based on revenue and other defined performance measures 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to sales and marketing expenses of million in the incremental expenses related to the maxstream acquisition increased sales and marketing expenses by million 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased by million for compensation related expenses and by million for miscellaneous other sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to research and development expenses of million in the incremental research and development expenses related to the maxstream acquisition accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million is primarily a result of compensation related expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to general and administrative expenses of million in general and administrative expenses increased million due to the incremental expenses related to the maxstream acquisition  million due to compensation related expenses  million due to bad debt expense  million due to the gain on sale of intellectual property sold in fiscal and the remaining million is due to maintenance expense and other related general and administrative expenses 
professional fees decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily related to reduced legal fees as well as reduced consulting fees 
we also recorded a million gain related to the sale of land in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge in fiscal for in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of maxstream 
compared to operating expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to operating expenses of million in the acquisition of maxstream resulted in million of additional operating expenses of which million is related to in process research and development 
fiscal also includes twelve months of operating expenses for rabbit and fs forth  acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in incremental operating expenses of million of which million is related to identifiable intangibles amortization expense in as a result of the adoption of fas r on october   we recorded million in stock based compensation expense in fiscal operating expense savings of million were realized in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to savings in compensation related expenses  contract labor and professional fees 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to sales and marketing expenses of million in sales and marketing expenses increased by an incremental million due to the acquisitions of maxstream  rabbit and fs forth and by an incremental million due to stock based compensation expense 
these increases were offset by a decrease in compensation related expenses of million due to fewer employees and decreased commissions in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating expenses continued research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million or  compared to research and development expenses of million in research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental research and development expenses of million due to the acquisitions of maxstream  rabbit and fs forth and by an incremental million due to stock based compensation expense

the aforementioned increases in expenses were offset by savings of million in compensation related expenses  professional fees and depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
intellectual property associated with a prior acquisition was sold for million and was recorded as a reduction of expense in general and administrative expenses in fiscal in process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of maxstream were million in  compared to in process research and development expenses of million in associated with the acquisition of rabbit in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development maxstream  inc on july   we acquired maxstream  inc maxstream  a privately held corporation 
the total purchase price of million included million in cash excluding cash acquired of million and million in common stock  in exchange for all outstanding shares of maxstream s preferred and common stock and outstanding stock options 
we did not replace maxstream s outstanding options with digi options 
at the time of acquisition  maxstream had development projects in process associated with the xstream gen 
 x 
eleven  mesh firmware  xbee zigbee firmware and xplore products 
we estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of acquired in process research and development related to the products listed below in thousands that were under development  had a measurable percentage completed and a documented expected life  had not yet reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative future uses 
this amount was expensed as a non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition

along with the x 
eleven and xbee zigbee firmware projects are expected to be released in fiscal year these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
we anticipate that the projected revenue from these projects will be in line with original projections 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued rabbit semiconductor inc on may   we acquired rabbit  formerly z world  inc  a privately held corporation for a purchase price of million in cash excluding cash acquired of million and assumption of million in debt 
at the time of acquisition  rabbit had a development project in process for the rabbit microprocessor 
the project involved the design and development of a next generation microprocessor that would have increased code execution speed  reduced code size  added security features  and integrated ethernet capabilities 
we estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of acquired in process research and development related to the rabbit microprocessor that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
this amount was expensed as a non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
we released the rabbit microprocessor in march we anticipate that the projected revenue from the rabbit microprocessor will be in line with original projections 
these estimates are subject to change and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
other income  net other income  net was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we realized million of interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents compared to million during fiscal the increase in interest income was due to higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates 
the average investment balance during fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal we earned an average interest rate of during fiscal compared to for fiscal interest expense was million for fiscal and related to our capital leases 
total other income  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we realized interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was partially offset by a decrease in the average investment balance 
we earned an average interest rate of approximately during fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the invested balance averaged million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal primarily related to interest expense on the million short term loan that was used to finance the maxstream acquisition and interest on capital leases 
the short term loan was paid in full in august other expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we reversed million in income tax reserves associated with the closing of a german tax audit and the statutory closing of a prior us federal and state tax year 
we also recorded other discrete tax benefits of million primarily related to the filing of us amended tax returns  enactment of the extension of the research and development tax credit  and adjustments to actual for items reported on the tax returns filed for fiscal the aforementioned income tax benefits resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves and other discrete tax benefits reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes continued during fiscal  we recorded million in discrete tax benefits  primarily related to an audit of prior fiscal years which was settled with the french government in we had established excess tax reserves that were no longer required as a result of the settlement 
we recorded an income tax benefit as a result of the reversal of the excess tax reserves related to this settlement 
the aforementioned discrete income tax benefits reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal these tax benefits were partially offset by non deductible maxstream acquired in process research and development expense  which increased the effective tax rate in fiscal by percentage points see reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the congressional joint committee on taxation approved a settlement with the internal revenue service on an audit of certain of our prior fiscal years income tax returns 
we had established tax reserves in excess of the ultimate settled amounts 
as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal representing the excess of our income tax reserves over the amount paid 
the income tax benefit of million reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal  and are lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to the aforementioned income tax benefits and the utilization of income tax credits and exclusions for extraterritorial income in all years and the domestic production activities deduction in fiscal and as of september   we had united states federal tax credit carryforwards of million which expire at various dates through we also had foreign tax credit carryforwards at september  of million the majority of which carry forward indefinitely 
we are required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance against those assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on future projected taxable income and the anticipated future reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and therefore no valuation allowance has been established at september  the amount of the net deferred tax assets realized  however  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if our future taxable income projections are not realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in future taxable income is determined 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial position

this net increase is primarily due to an increase of million of net income and a reduction of million for non cash items  primarily related to deferred income taxes  in process research and development charges and gain on sale of land during fiscal  offset by increases primarily related to stock based compensation and provisions for bad debts 
changes in working capital increased cash flows by million resulting from increases of million from changes in accounts receivable  income taxes payable  accounts payable and other accrued expenses offset by a reduction in cash flows of million due to inventories as additional material purchases and production builds in order to fulfill order demand 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal  an increase of million 
changes in working capital generated a million increase in net cash provided by operating activities  resulting from changes in income taxes payable and accounts receivable  partially offset by reductions resulting from inventory and accounts payable

this was offset by million of cash used for capital lease obligations 
we entered into a million short term loan agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal to finance the maxstream acquisition and repaid the loan in the same quarter 
we generated million from financing activities in fiscal primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans of million 
we entered into a million short term loan during the third quarter of fiscal to finance the rabbit acquisition 
we determined that it was more economical to borrow funds to finance the rabbit acquisition than to liquidate marketable securities prior to their scheduled maturities 
this short term loan was repaid in fiscal during fiscal  we used million to fully pay an outstanding balance on a revolving line of credit that was assumed as a result of the rabbit acquisition 
our management believes that current financial resources  cash generated from operations and our potential capacity for debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations for the next twelve months

eitf no 
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and not recognized as expense until the research and development activities are performed 
eitf no 
is applicable prospectively to new contractual arrangements entered into beginning in our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of eitf no 
will have  but do not believe it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas could have on our consolidated financial statements  if we decide to adopt  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of fas are effective for our fiscal year beginning october  for financial assets and liabilities and for non financial assets and liabilities beginning october  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin are effective for us beginning october  we anticipate that the effect of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements will be immaterial 
however  we expect to reclassify substantially all of our unrecognized tax benefits from current to non current liabilities  since payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded products to our distributors and direct end user oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  compared to million at september  we also generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
revenue recognized resulting from such non product sales represented of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for software licenses  professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance  which includes delivery of a final product version and acceptance by the customer 
for post contract customer support and fees associated with technical support  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as service is performed 
unearned post contract customer support and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectibility of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both september  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at september  and  respectively 
the reserve decreased by million in fiscal primarily due to write offs of excess and obsolete inventory 
identifiable intangible assets purchased proven technology  customer relationships  license agreements  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition  or at cost when not purchased in a business combination 
purchased in process research and development costs ipr d are expensed upon consummation of the related business acquisition 
all other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to thirteen years 
useful lives for identifiable intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which we expect to derive benefits from the identifiable intangible assets 
methods of amortization reflect the pattern in which the asset is consumed 
to date  all of our identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis 
amortization of purchased and core technology is presented as a separate component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
amortization of all other acquired identifiable intangible assets is charged to operating expenses as a component of general and administrative expense 
in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
we measure impairment loss by utilizing an undiscounted cash flow valuation technique using fair values indicated by the income approach 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded currently 
to the extent that our undiscounted future cash flows were to decline substantially  such an impairment charge could result 
no impairment was identified during fiscal there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made  our consolidated results of operations or financial position could be materially impacted 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and is not amortized 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually which may result in a charge to operations if the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is reported declines 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the fair value of goodwill 
significant assumptions include our estimates of future cash flows and the cost of capital 
these and other estimates are based upon information that we use to prepare our annual and five year business plan projections 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made  our consolidated results of operations or financial position could be materially impacted 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june  and determined that there was no impairment 
goodwill of million is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to our income tax balances that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal  we reversed million in income tax reserves primarily associated with the closing of a german tax audit and the statutory closing of a prior us federal and state tax year 
we also recorded other discrete tax benefits of million related to the filing of us amended tax returns  enactment of the extension of the research and development tax credit  and adjustments to actual for items reported on the tax returns filed for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded discrete tax benefits of million  primarily related to the settlement of an audit with the french government of certain of our prior fiscal years income tax returns 
we had established tax reserves that were no longer required as a result of the settlement 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the internal revenue service irs completed an audit of certain of our prior fiscal years income tax returns  subject to final approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation 
as a result of a settlement agreement associated with this audit  we paid million to the irs in the first quarter of fiscal resulting in a reduction to the income taxes payable liability 
in february  the congressional joint committee on taxation approved the settlement with the irs 
we had tax reserves recorded in excess of the ultimate amount settled  resulting in an income tax benefit of million in fiscal representing the excess income tax reserves over the amount paid 
see note to our consolidated financial statements
