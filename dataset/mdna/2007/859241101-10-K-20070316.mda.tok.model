risk factors 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant page 
table of contents estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our contracts  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue  cost and profit include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of subcontractors  unusual weather conditions  our productivity and efficient use of labor and equipment and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have a large number of contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
after we are advised that our bid is the winning bid  we enter into firm contracts with our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting those contract costs 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
the principal remaining risks under fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity levels 
as a result  we have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense page 
table of contents primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to finish uncompleted contracts 
our cost estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our contracts can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of contracts of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a more significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the contract and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 
valuation of long term assets 
long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
in addition  we had goodwill with a value of approximately million at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment  and an impairment charge may be required in the future 
we completed our annual impairment review for goodwill effective october   and it did not result in an impairment 
page 
table of contents income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
because realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards  or nol s  is not assured  our valuation allowance at the respective time represents the amount of the deferred tax assets that we determine are more likely than not to expire unutilized 
reflecting management s assessment of expected future operating profitability  we expect to utilize all remaining nol s and therefore eliminated our valuation allowance in we had previously reduced our valuation allowance in by million 
we are subject to the alternative minimum tax amt 
because we are still utilizing our nol s to offset taxable income  payment of amt results in a reduction of our deferred tax liability 
in  the state of texas revised its existing franchise tax to include most business entities the texas margins tax  which will become effective for franchise tax reports due after january  we have assessed that the texas margins tax has on our existing deferred tax liabilities  which was not material to the consolidated financial statements at december  as of december   we had nol s of approximately million  which will expire in  if unused 
we currently expect that our nol s will be fully utilized during after the expiration or utilization of our nol s  we have available to us the tax benefit resulting from exercise of a significant number of non qualified in the money options amounting to million an ownership change  which may occur if there is a transfer of ownership exceeding of our outstanding shares of common stock in any three year period  may lead to a limitation in the usability of  or a potential loss of some or all of  the nol s 
in order to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change occurring  our certificate of incorporation  as amended  prohibits transfers of our common stock resulting in  or increasing  individual holdings in excess of of our common stock  unless such transfer is made by us or with the consent of our board of directors 
because the regulations governing nol s are highly complex and may be changed from time to time  and because our attempts to prevent an ownership change from occurring may not be successful  the nol s could be limited or lost 
we believe that the nol s are currently available in full  however  and intend to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that they will remain available 
to the extent the nol s become unavailable to us our future taxable income and that of any consolidated affiliate will be subject to federal taxation  thus reducing funds otherwise available for corporate purposes 
on january   the company will adopt the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 fin which establishes the criteria that an individual tax position must meet for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in our financial statements 
adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations 
in august  our board of directors authorized management to sell our distribution business 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we determined in the third quarter of that the distribution business became a long lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation 
in october  we sold the distribution business to an industry related buyer for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december

our revenue increase of million  or  from to included a substantial increase in revenues from state highway work of million  or  to million as we took advantage of the very strong bidding climate in this sector and the resultant increase in the proportion of state highway contracts in our backlog 
in particular  we saw a near tripling of revenues in the dallas market  where we won several major contracts in early  and also good growth in the san antonio market 
state highway contracts generally allow us to achieve greater revenue and gross profit production from our equipment and work crews  although on average the gross margins on this work are slightly lower than on our water infrastructure contracts in the municipal markets 
at the same time there was a decrease in our municipal revenues of million  or to million 
the overall revenue expansion was facilitated by an increase of over two hundred employees in  and a significant increase in our equipment fleet 
the increase was achieved despite a generally wetter year in in most of our markets than in  which adversely affected production rates  and the impact of some significant delays in starting certain contracts in the first three quarters of  which were due to factors outside our control 
gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the increase in revenues  combined with the higher gross margins 
this margin improvement was attributable principally to a better margin mix in backlog resulting from the improved bidding climate since  and to efficiencies resulting from the higher revenue levels achieved in these factors overcame the negative impact on gross margins of the wetter weather in and the delay in starting certain contracts  as described above 
they also helped offset the downward pressure on gross margins arising from the increased percentage of state highway work  from in to in in both years  we achieved a number of incentive awards upon the successful completion of contract milestones 
contract backlog 
the million increase in contract backlog in reflected the on going broadening of our service platform and the generally good bidding environment in our markets  especially in the dallas fort worth area where our backlog expanded significantly during the year 
page 
table of contents general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  or g a  in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  increased stock based compensation expense resulting from our higher share price in  and higher legal and accounting fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of the growing business  our ratio of g a expenses to revenue remained essentially unchanged from to  at

the increase in operating income resulted principally from the higher revenues and gross margins  which led to an increase in operating margin from to 
interest expense net of interest income 
in we invested cash raised in our public stock offering on which we earned over million of interest 
in  we paid million of interest expense primarily on related party debt which was repaid in january from the proceeds of our public offering 
income taxes 
in we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset following management s review of the likelihood that tax loss carryforwards would be substantially utilized in the future 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of in in we recorded a more normal tax charge at of income 
net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the various factors discussed above 
effect of income tax benefits 
although we have the benefit of significant nol s  which offset most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain adjustments resulting from our recovery of the deferred tax asset are recorded in the income statement 
those adjustments resulted in a benefit of million in assuming an income tax rate of  and disregarding adjustments to our deferred tax asset and other timing differences  net income would have been million for so that  on a comparative basis  the net income level of million for represents an increase of approximately

discontinued operations for and represent the results of operations of our distribution business  which was operated by steel city products  llc 
the increase in the net income of discontinued operations was primarily due to increases in gross margins from in to in through the date of sale 
the distribution business was sold on october  the company recorded proceeds from the sale of approximately million and paid million to retire the revolving line of credit 
the company recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately  and recorded  in income tax expense related to that gain

the revenue increase from to  which includes an increase in revenues from state highway work of million  or  to million and an increase in municipal revenues of million  or  to million was due to several factors  including a growing contract backlog  which enabled us to expand our equipment fleet and to hire more field crews  especially in the san antonio and austin markets  the continuing expansion of our construction capabilities  which allowed us to bid for and take on larger and more complex work  certain water main contracts that included large diameter pipe  facilitating greater revenues to be generated by our crews  the increase in the proportion of state highway contracts  which generally allow greater revenue production from our equipment and work crews  and generally better weather during which allowed for continuous work on construction contracts  compared with one of the wettest years on record in gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the revenue increase  combined with the slightly higher gross margins 
the margin improvement was attributable to the gradual improvement in gross margins in our contract backlog during combined with improved productivity resulting from good weather during the year and the efficiencies arising from having a greater number of larger and longer duration contracts in work than in the past 
contract backlog 
the million increase in contract backlog reflected the on going broadening of our service platform and the continuation of a favorable bidding climate in our markets  and included the winning of several large contracts particularly two txdot contracts with an aggregate value of million and a million contract with travelers casualty and surety company to complete a txdot contract taken over by travelers after a default by the original contractor 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  or g a  in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  increased variable compensation resulting from our improved profits  and higher legal and accounting fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of the page 
table of contents growing business  the significantly higher revenues in meant that the ratio of g a expenses to revenue decreased from in to in operating income 
the increase in operating income and operating margin resulted from the higher gross margins and lower ratio of g a expenses to revenues 
interest expense net of interest income 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted from a  increase in interest income earned on higher cash balances 
minority interest 
because we acquired the remaining of sterling houston holdings  inc in december  no minority interest expense was recorded in income taxes 
in both and we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset following management s review of the likelihood that tax loss carryforwards would be substantially utilized in the future 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of in and a tax benefit in net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the factors discussed above and resulted in the increase in basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations 
effect of income tax benefits 
although we have the benefit of significant nol s  which offset most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain adjustments resulting from our recovery of the deferred tax asset are recorded in the income statement

significant non cash items included in operating activities for were depreciation and amortization  which totaled million  an increase of million from  as a result of the continued increase in the size of our construction fleet  tax expense  which increased by million in due principally to the increase in operating income 
in we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset 
although we have the benefit of significant nol s which offset most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements  through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  we accelerate the depreciation of our fixed assets for tax purposes 
the significant additions to fixed assets in increased our deferred tax liability and certain other timing differences are recorded in the income statement  and stock based compensation expense  which increased by  from  resulting from grants in issued at significantly higher exercise prices due to an increase in our stock price over the year 
significant components of the changes in working capital are as follows there was an increase of million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in compared with a decrease of million in these changes reflect timing differences as contracts progress  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by million in  while in there was an increase of million 
these changes principally reflect fluctuations in the timing and amount of mobilization payments to assist in the start up on certain contracts  trade payables decreased by million in compared with an increase of million in  reflecting the strength of our cash position  and contracts receivable increased by million in and by million in  principally reflecting the revenue increase and related level of customer retentions

table of contents investing activities 
expenditures to expand our construction fleet were million in compared with million in the much enlarged contract backlog required a significant expansion and upgrade of our fleet in and in january  we purchased certain assets of rathole drilling  inc in order to expand our construction capabilities and in  we invested funds raised in our public sale of common stock in auction rate securities 
financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was principally due to the sale of common stock to the public in january  in which our net proceeds exceeded million 
in addition  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
funds received from the exercise of warrants by north atlantic smaller companies investment trust plc  or nascit  and the exercise of options by employees and directors totaled million during compared with option exercise proceeds of million in in and we used approximately million and million  respectively  to pay long term debt  which included payments on notes to related parties 
during  there was an increase in borrowings under the lines of credit of million because capital expenditures  long term debt repayments and working capital requirements exceeded cash provided by operations 
liquidity the level of working capital for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in the levels of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  and of billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments  of customer receivables and of contract retentions  and the level of amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
the significant increase in our working capital level in has been an important element in enabling us to expand our bonding facilities and therefore to continue to bid on larger and longer lived projects 
the company believes that it has sufficient financial resources to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations 
sources of capital in addition to cash provided from operations  we use our revolving lines of credit to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
construction business revolver 
our construction business has a revolving credit facility with comerica bank  or the construction business revolver 
in april  we renewed our existing line of credit to extend the maturity date and to increase our borrowing capacity 
the construction business revolver has a maturity date of may  and is a collateral based facility with total borrowing capacity  subject to a borrowing base  of up to million 
at december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the construction business revolver and we had unused availability of million  in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investment securities available for sale of million 
the construction business revolver is secured by all of our construction business equipment and provides working capital financing for the operation of our construction business and to fund the acquisition of equipment 
the construction business revolver requires the payment of a quarterly commitment fee of per annum of the unused portion of the line of credit 
borrowing interest rates are based on the bank s prime rate or on a eurodollar rate at the option of the company 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under the construction business revolver during the year ended december  ranged from to 
the construction business revolver is subject to our compliance with financial covenants relating to working capital  tangible net worth  fixed charges and cash coverage  and debt leverage ratios 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

other debt related party notes 
since  certain directors  affiliates and members of management have from time to time and through various methods provided financing to help fund our expansion and operations 
principal and interest at the rate of per annum were payable quarterly on these unsecured notes

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mortgages 
in we completed the construction of a new headquarters building on land owned by us adjacent to our equipment repair facility in houston 
the building was financed principally through an additional mortgage of million on the land and facilities at a floating interest rate which at december  was per annum  repayable over years 
this mortgage is cross collateralized with a prior mortgage on the land and equipment repair facilities  which were purchased in  in the original amount of  repayable over years with an interest rate of per annum 
in addition  we have available to us a long term facility of up to million repayable over years to finance the expansion of our office building and maintenance facilities

to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids for construction contracts  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided
