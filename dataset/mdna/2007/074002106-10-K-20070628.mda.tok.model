in february  we also granted performance cash awards providing for the payment of up to million to a group of our managing directors and other high performing senior level employees 
these cash retention awards generally are earned if we are able to achieve certain performance metrics  similar to those required under the psu program 
these performance cash awards were designed to retain our existing employees by diversifying their performance awards between cash and equity awards 
for additional information on the performance cash awards  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations principal business priorities for and beyond  and note  stock based compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  we began our partnership with yale university to create the bearingpoint leadership program at the yale school of management  an innovative education and training program focusing on career and leadership development for our employees 
we believe that our collaboration with yale will offer our employees and new recruits with a unique learning experience that will help improve our ability to recruit and retain talented and motivated employees  enhance the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and cultivate a shared set of values  skills and culture that we hope will come to define a career with us 
as part of our increased emphasis on a pay for performance compensation structure  we introduced performance based cash bonus incentives in in  we paid performance based cash bonuses in an aggregate amount of million to select staff level employees  based on performance 
through june  we have paid performance based cash bonuses totaling approximately million million to staff  million to managing directors  based on performance 
we believe the payment of a bonus for performance was appropriate  for retention purposes and because we were able to sustain our underlying operations and our core business continued to perform  despite the issues we continue to face with respect to our financial accounting systems and efforts to become timely in our sec periodic filings 
under our be an owner program  eligible employees below the managing director level were intended to receive a stock grant equivalent to of their annual salaries as of october  in january  we paid the first half of the amount of annual salary as of october  to our eligible employees in cash  in an aggregate amount of million 
after we have become current in our sec periodic filings and we are able to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock  we intend to make a special contribution of approximately million the remaining of annual salary as of october  under our employee stock purchase plan the espp on behalf of these eligible employees  which will be used to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the espp 
background we were incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of the state of delaware in we were part of kpmg llp  now one of the big accounting and tax firms 
in january  kpmg llp transferred its consulting business to our company 
in february  we completed our initial public offering  and on october   we changed our name to bearingpoint  inc from kpmg consulting  inc 
our principal offices are located at international drive  mclean  virginia our main telephone number is 
in  we significantly expanded our european presence with the purchase of kpmg consulting ag subsequently renamed bearingpoint gmbh  which included employees primarily in germany  switzerland and austria 
we continued to further our global expansion in by acquiring all or portions of the consulting practices of several global accounting firms in brazil  finland  france  japan  norway  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united states 
item a 
risk factors risks that relate to our failure to timely file periodic reports with the sec and our internal control over financial reporting the process  training and systems issues related to financial accounting for our north american operations and the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continue to materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
so long as we are unable to resolve these issues and remediate these material weaknesses  we will be in jeopardy of being unable to timely file our periodic reports with the sec as they come due  and it is likely that our financial condition and results of operations will continue to be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the longer the period of time before we become current in our periodic filings with the sec and or the number of subsequent failures to timely file any future periodic reports with the sec could increase the likelihood or frequency of occurrence and severity of the impact of any of the risks described below 
our continuing failure to timely file certain periodic reports with the sec poses significant risks to our business  each of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we did not timely file with the sec our forms k for  and  and we have not yet filed with the sec our forms q for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september  and march  consequently  we are not compliant with the reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of the exchange act or the listing rules of the new york stock exchange the nyse 
our inability to timely file our periodic reports with the sec involves a number of significant risks  including if we are not timely in filing our periodic reports by october   i a breach could be declared by our lenders under our senior secured credit facility  which may result in the lenders declaring our outstanding loans due and payable in whole or in part  and potentially resulting in a cross default to one or more series of our convertible subordinated debentures and other indebtedness  and or ii a breach could be claimed by holders of one or more series of our subordinated debentures resulting in a cross default under our senior secured credit facility 
see risks that relate to our liquidity 
if the nyse ceases to grant us extensions to file our periodic reports with the nyse  it has the right to begin proceedings to delist our common stock 
a delisting of our common stock would have a material adverse effect on us by  among other things reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock  resulting in a possible event of default under and acceleration of our senior secured credit facility and triggering a right to the holders of our debentures to request us to repurchase all then outstanding debentures  and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  thereby restricting our ability to obtain equity financing 
we may have difficulty retaining our clients and obtaining new clients 
we are not eligible to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities  which prevents us from accessing the public capital markets or delivering shares under our equity plans 
because we are not current in our sec periodic filings  significant features of many of our employee equity plans remain suspended and our employees have effectively been precluded from realizing the appreciation in equity based awards 
the longer we are unable to deliver shares for purchase under our espp  the higher likelihood that we may experience increased rates of withdrawals by our employees of their accumulated contributions to our espp 
for more information  see risks that relate to our liquidity 
any of these events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in  we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  the remediation of which has materially and adversely affected our business and financial condition  and as of december   these material weaknesses remain 
as discussed in item a  controls and procedures  of this annual report  our management has conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and has identified a number of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of december  a detailed description of each material weakness is described in item a of this annual report 
due to these material weaknesses  management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  the existence of these material weaknesses continue to cause us to perform significant  substantial procedures to compensate for them 
these material weaknesses  and other material weaknesses since remediated  also previously caused significant errors that led to the restatement of a number of our previously issued financial statements for certain fiscal periods prior to our year ended december  management s conclusion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for  as well as the material weaknesses that contributed to that conclusion  remain substantially the same as management s conclusion  and the material weaknesses contributing to that conclusion  for and we were unsuccessful in our attempts to remediate significant numbers of material weaknesses by the end of we can currently give no assurances as to how many material weaknesses will be remediated by the end of we currently do not anticipate full remediation of all material weaknesses until moreover  we continue to experience difficulty in internally producing accurate and timely forecasted financial information due  in part  to issues related to the material control weaknesses and other deficiencies identified as part of management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and to the delays in filing our periodic reports with the sec 
while we continue to address many of the underlying issues that have affected our ability to produce accurate internal financial forecasts  there can be no assurance that our ability to produce such forecasts has sufficiently improved to enable us to accurately and timely predict and assess the ongoing cash demands or financial needs of our business 
moreover  our difficulties in producing accurate internal financial forecasts could continue to jeopardize the accuracy of any financial guidance we provide publicly 
we have engaged in  and continue to engage in  substantial efforts to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we have taken or plan to take will ensure that we design  implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or will be sufficient to address and eliminate these material weaknesses 
our inability to remedy these identified material weaknesses or any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future  could  among other things  cause us to fail to file our periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner  result in the need to restate financial results for prior periods  prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial information and forecasts or from avoiding or detecting fraud  result in the loss of government contracts  or require us to incur further additional costs or divert management resources 
due to its inherent limitations  effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances that transactions are properly recorded  or that the unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets  or inappropriate reimbursements and expenditures  will be detected 
these limitations may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud  regardless of their effectiveness 
furthermore  in order to sustain the timely production of our financial statements and sec periodic reports  we must dramatically reduce the time required to prepare our financial statement accounts and balances 
until our material weaknesses have been remediated  we will not be able to fully minimize the time required to prepare our financial statement accounts and balances 
our ability to become timely and remain current in our sec periodic filings will depend on  among other things  our ability to increase the focus of  and maximize the cooperation from  our client engagement teams and other corporate services in providing financial information and updates into our financial closing process on a timely basis 
if we are unable to achieve these efficiencies  we may be unable to become timely in our sec periodic filings  or to sustain being timely once current 
we face risks related to securities litigation and regulatory actions that could adversely affect our financial condition and business 
we are subject to several securities class action litigation suits 
we are also subject to an enforcement investigation by the sec 
these lawsuits and the sec investigation are described in item  legal proceedings  and note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our senior management and board of directors devote significant time to these matters 
these lawsuits and the sec investigation may cause us to incur significant legal expenses  could have a disruptive effect upon the operations of our business  and could consume inordinate amounts of the time and attention of our senior management and board of directors 
depending on the outcome of these lawsuits and the sec investigation  we may be required to pay material damages and fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  or suffer other penalties  remedies or sanctions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and condition and  consequently  negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
risks that relate to our business our business may be adversely impacted as a result of changes in demand  both globally and in individual market segments  for our consulting and systems integration services 
our business tends to lag behind economic cycles  consequently  we may experience rapid decreases in demand at the onset of significant economic downturns while the benefits of economic recovery may take longer to realize 
economic and political uncertainties adversely impact our clients demand for our services 
during an economic downturn  our clients and potential clients often cancel  reduce or defer existing contracts and delay entering into new engagements  thereby reducing new contract bookings 
in general  companies also reduce the amount of spending on information technology products and services during difficult economic times  resulting in limited implementations of new technology and smaller engagements 
our contracts funded by us federal government agencies  inclusive of government sponsored enterprises  accounted for approximately of our revenue in we depend particularly on contracts funded by clients within the department of defense  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in we believe that our us federal government contracts will continue to be a source of a significant amount of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our business could be materially harmed if the federal government reduces its spending or reduces the budgets of its departments or agencies 
reduced budget and other political and regulatory factors may cause these departments and agencies to reduce their purchases under  or exercise their rights to terminate  existing contracts  or may result in fewer or smaller new contracts to be awarded to us 
our operating results will suffer if we are not able to maintain our billing and utilization rates or control our costs 
our operating results are largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the utilization rates  or chargeability  of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  or if we cannot manage our cost structure  our operating results will be negatively impacted  we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer 
factors affecting the rates we are able to charge for our services include our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  our ability to access and use of lower cost service delivery personnel  as compared to the ability of our competitors to do so  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors  pricing policies of our competitors  and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
factors affecting our utilization rates include seasonal trends  primarily as a result of our hiring cycle and holiday and summer vacations  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  our ability to manage attrition  and our ability to mobilize our workforce quickly or economically  especially outside the united states 
our operating results are also a function of our ability to control our costs 
if we are unable to control these costs  such as costs associated with the production of financial statements  settlement of lawsuits or management of a significantly larger and more diverse workforce  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we continue to incur selling  general and administrative sg a expenses at levels significantly higher than those of our competitors 
if we are unable to significantly reduce sg a expenses over the near term  our ability to achieve  and make significant improvements in  net income and profitability will remain in jeopardy 
in recent years we have experienced exceptionally high levels of sg a expenses  primarily as a result of continuing issues related to our north american financial reporting systems and our internal controls  higher than average costs associated with hiring and retaining our employees and other assorted costs  including legal expenses associated with various disputes and litigation 
during  we incurred external costs related to the closing of our financial statements of approximately million  compared to approximately million in we currently expect our costs for related to these efforts to be approximately million 
in addition  we also currently expect to incur an additional million in costs in related to preparation for the transition to our new north american financial reporting systems 
given our decision to defer implementation of our north american financial reporting systems until mid  the level of these external and preparatory costs may vary significantly 
it is likely that higher than normal sg a costs will continue through and as we seek to achieve our objectives of timely preparing and filing our financial statements and sec periodic reports  remediating material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and completing the replacement of our north american financial reporting systems 
our ability to reduce future sg a expenses is dependent  among other things  on improving our controls around the financial closing process  remediating deficiencies in our internal controls  reducing the amount of time and effort spent to substantiate the accuracy and completeness of our financial results  reducing redundant systems and activities  streamlining the input and capture of data  and hiring and retaining skilled finance and accounting personnel while decreasing the number of personnel required to support our financial close process  including reliance on contractors 
if we are unable to achieve these objectives  offset these costs through other expense reductions  or if we encounter additional difficulties or setbacks in achieving these objectives  our sg a expenses could significantly exceed currently expected levels and  consequently  materially and adversely affect our competitive position  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the systems integration consulting markets are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively if we are not able to maintain our billing rates or control our costs related to these engagements 
systems integration consulting constitutes a significant part of our business 
historically  these markets have included a large number of participants and have been highly competitive 
recent increases in the number and availability of competing global delivery alternatives for systems integration work create ever increasing pricing pressures in these markets 
we frequently compete with companies that have greater global delivery capabilities and alternatives  financial resources  name recognition and market share than we do 
if we are unable to maintain our billing rates through delivering unique and differentiated systems integration solutions and control our costs through proper management of our workforce  global delivery centers and other available resources  we may lose the ability to compete effectively for this significant portion of our business 
contracting with the federal government is inherently risky and exposes us to risks that may materially and adversely affect our business 
we depend on contracts with us federal government agencies  particularly with the department of defense  for a significant portion of our revenue and consequently we are exposed to various risks inherent in the government contracting process  including the following our government contracts are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  which are unfavorable to us 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to establish temporary holdbacks of funds due and owed to us under contracts for various reasons  terminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  claim rights in products  systems and technology produced by us  prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency if it is found that our prior relationship with that agency gives us an unfair advantage over competing contractors  subject the award of contracts to protest by competitors  which may require the suspension of our performance pending the outcome of the protest or our resubmission of a bid for the contract  or result in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract  and prospectively reduce our pricing based upon achieving certain agreed service volumes or other metrics and reimburse any previously charged amounts subsequently found to have been improperly charged under the contract 
our failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients  which could cause us to lose business 
in addition  security breaches in sensitive government systems that we have developed could damage our reputation and eligibility for additional work and expose us to significant losses 
the federal government audits and reviews our performance on contracts  pricing and cost allocation practices  cost structure  systems  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the government finds that our costs are not reimbursable  have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our costs  we may not be allowed to bill for all or part of those costs  or we may have to refund cash that we have already collected  which may materially affect our operating margin and the expected timing of our cash flows 
government contracting officers have wide latitude in their ability to conclude as to the financial responsibility of companies that contract with agencies of the us federal government 
officers who conclude that a company is not financially responsible may withhold new engagements and terminate recently contracted engagements for which significant expenditures and outlays already may have been made 
if the government uncovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
these consequences could materially and adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
the inherent limitations of internal controls  even when adequate  may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of its accuracy  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of these occurrences or conditions could affect not only our business with the agency or department involved  but also other agencies and departments within the federal government 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the budget reduction  potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 
our ability to attract  retain and motivate our managing directors and other key employees is critical to the success of our business 
we continue to experience sustained  higher than industry average levels of voluntary turnover among our workforce  which has impacted our ability to grow our business 
our success depends largely on our general ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled professionals 
competition for skilled personnel in the consulting and technology services business is intense 
in light of our current issues related to our north american financial reporting systems and our internal controls  it is particularly critical that we continue to attract and retain experienced finance personnel 
recruiting  training and retention costs and benefits place significant demands on our resources 
in addition  because we are not current in our sec periodic filings  the near term value of our equity incentives is uncertain  and our ability to use equity to attract  motivate and retain our professionals is in jeopardy 
significant features of many of our employee equity plans remain suspended 
the continuing loss of significant numbers of our professionals or the inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain additional skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on us  including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important engagements and thus maintain or increase our revenue 
our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice  or our clients may cancel or delay projects 
our clients typically retain us on a non exclusive  engagement by engagement basis  rather than under exclusive long term contracts 
most of our consulting engagements are less than months in duration 
most of our contracts can be terminated by our clients upon short notice and without significant penalty 
large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages  and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
these terminations  cancellations or delays could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project  but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client or the economy generally 
when contracts are terminated  cancelled or delayed  we lose the associated revenue  and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner 
consequently  our operating results in subsequent periods may be adversely impacted 
if we are not able to keep up with rapid changes in technology or maintain strong relationships with software providers  our business could suffer 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop service offerings that keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
our success also depends on our ability to develop and implement ideas for the successful application of existing and new technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis  or our ideas may not be successful in the marketplace 
also  products and technologies developed by our competitors may make our services or product offerings less competitive or obsolete 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 
in addition  we generate a significant portion of our revenue from projects to implement software developed by others 
our future success in the software implementation business depends  in part  on the continuing viability of these companies  their ability to maintain market leadership and our ability to maintain a good relationship with these companies 
loss of our joint marketing relationships could reduce our revenue and growth prospects 
our most significant joint marketing relationships are with microsoft corporation  oracle corporation and sap ag 
these relationships enable us to increase revenue by providing us additional marketing exposure  expanding our sales coverage  increasing the training of our professionals and developing and co branding service offerings that respond to customer demand 
the loss of one or more of these relationships could adversely affect our business by terminating current joint marketing and product development efforts or otherwise decreasing our revenue and growth prospects 
because most of our significant joint marketing relationships are nonexclusive  if our competitors are more successful in  among other things  building leading edge products and services  these entities may form closer or preferred arrangements with other consulting organizations  which could materially reduce our revenue 
we are not likely to be able to significantly grow our business through mergers and acquisitions in the near term 
we have had limited success in valuing and integrating acquisitions into our business 
given past experiences  the current competing demands for our capital resources and limitations contained in our senior secured credit facility  we are unlikely to grow our business through significant acquisitions 
our inability to do so may competitively disadvantage us or jeopardize our independence 
there will not be a consistent pattern in our financial results from quarter to quarter  which may result in increased volatility of our stock price 
our quarterly revenue and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making them difficult to predict 
this may lead to volatility in our stock price 
factors that could cause variations in our quarterly financial results include the business decisions of our clients regarding the use of our services  seasonality  including the number of work days and holidays and summer vacations  the stage of completion of existing projects or their termination  cost overruns or revenue write offs resulting from unexpected delays or delivery issues on engagements  periodic differences between our clients estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing engagements  our ability to transition employees quickly from completed projects to new engagements  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  our ability to manage costs  including personnel costs and support services costs  particularly outside the united states where local labor laws may significantly affect our ability to mobilize personnel quickly or economically  currency exchange fluctuations  ongoing costs associated with our efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  and to produce timely and accurate financial information despite the continuing existence of these material weaknesses  changes in  or the application of changes to  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  particularly those related to revenue recognition  and global  regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks  including acts of terrorism 
our profitability may decline due to financial  regulatory and operational risks inherent in worldwide operations 
in  approximately of our revenue was attributable to activities outside north america 
our results of operations are affected by our ability to manage risks inherent in our doing business abroad 
these risks include exchange rate fluctuation  regulatory concerns  terrorist activity  restrictions with respect to the movement of currency  access to highly skilled workers  political and economic stability  unauthorized and improper activities of employees and our ability to protect our intellectual property 
despite our best efforts  we may not be in compliance with all regulations around the world and may be subject to penalties and fines as a result 
these penalties and fines may materially and adversely affect our profitability 
some of our services are performed in high risk locations  such as iraq and afghanistan  where the country or location is suffering from political  social or economic issues  or war or civil unrest 
in those locations  we incur substantial costs to maintain the safety of our personnel 
despite these precautions  the safety of our personnel in these locations may continue to be at risk 
despite our best efforts  we may suffer the loss of our employees or those of our contractors 
the risk of these losses and the costs of protecting against them may become prohibitive 
if so  we may face taking a decision regarding removing our employees from one or more of these countries and ceasing to seek new work or complete the existing contracts that we have in those countries or regions 
such a decision could  directly or indirectly  materially and adversely affect our current and future revenue  as well as our profitability 
we may bear the risk of cost overruns relating to our services  thereby adversely affecting our profitability 
the effort and cost associated with the completion of our systems integration  software development and implementation or other services are difficult to estimate and  in some cases  may significantly exceed the estimates made at the time we commence the services 
we often provide these services under level of effort and fixed price contracts 
the level of effort contracts are usually based on time and materials or direct costs plus a fee 
under these arrangements  we are able to bill our client based on the actual cost of completing the services  even if the ultimate cost of the services exceeds our initial estimates 
however  if the ultimate cost exceeds our initial estimate by a significant amount  we may have difficulty collecting the full amount that we are due under the contract  depending upon many factors  including the reasons for the increase in cost  our communication with the client throughout the project  and the client s satisfaction with the services 
as a result  we could incur losses with respect to these services even when they are priced on a level of effort basis 
if we provide these services under a fixed price contract  we bear the risk that the ultimate cost of the project will exceed the price to be charged to the client 
if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to perform under a contract  the profitability of these contracts may be materially and adversely affected 
we may face legal liabilities and damage to our professional reputation from claims made against our work 
many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the provisions we typically include in our contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the applications we develop may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 
moreover  as a consulting firm  we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high caliber professional services and integrity to retain and attract clients and employees 
as a result  claims made against our work may be more damaging in our industry than in other businesses 
negative publicity related to our client relationships  regardless of its accuracy  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new engagements 
our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot be sure that our services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and we may have infringement claims asserted against us 
these claims may harm our reputation  cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 
in some contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in some instances  the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenue we receive from the client 
any claims or litigation in this area may be costly and result in large awards against us and  whether we ultimately win or lose  could be time consuming  may injure our reputation  may result in costly delays or may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
if there is a successful claim of infringement or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights we require on a timely basis  our ability to use certain technologies  products  services and brand names may be limited  and our business may be harmed 
we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which are important to our success 
our success depends  in part  upon our plan to develop  capture and protect re usable proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality policies  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and patent  copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
our efforts in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property  and we may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate and timely action to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
depending on the circumstances  we may be required to grant a specific client certain intellectual property rights in materials developed in connection with an engagement  in which case we would seek to cross license the use of such rights 
in limited situations  however  we forego certain intellectual property rights in materials we help create  which may limit our ability to re use such materials for other clients 
any limitation on our ability to re use such materials could cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities and require us to incur additional cost to develop new or modified materials for future projects 
risks that relate to our liquidity our current cash resources might not be sufficient to meet our expected cash needs over time 
we have experienced recurring net losses 
we have generated positive cash flow from operations in only three quarters since the beginning of our fiscal year 
historically  we have often failed  sometimes significantly  to achieve management s periodic operating budgets and cash forecasts 
if we cannot consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  we will need to meet operating shortfalls with existing cash on hand  avail ourselves of the capital markets or implement or seek alternative strategies 
these alternative strategies could include seeking improvements in working capital management  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  seeking additional debt or equity capital and selling assets 
there can be no assurances that existing cash will be sufficient  we will have timely access to the capital markets or that any of these strategies can be implemented on satisfactory terms  on a timely basis  or at all 
we have been unable to issue shares of our common stock under our espp since february  the longer we are unable to issue shares of our common stock  the more likely our espp participants may elect to withdraw their accumulated cash contributions from the espp at rates higher than those we have historically experienced 
under our espp  eligible employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount  through payroll deductions that accumulate over an offering period 
shares of common stock typically are purchased under the espp every six months 
because we are not current in our sec periodic filings  we have been  and continue to be  unable to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock and have not issued any shares of common stock under the espp for our current offering period  which began on february  employee espp contributions are currently included in our available cash balances on hand  amounting to approximately million of accumulated contributions as of march  these contributions may be withdrawn by our employees on demand 
if we experience withdrawal rates higher than those we have historically experienced  our cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
our credit facility imposes a number of restrictions on the way in which we operate our business and may negatively affect our ability to finance future needs  or do so on favorable terms 
if we violate these restrictions  we will be in default under the credit facility  which may cross default to our other indebtedness 
on may   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility and on june   we amended and restated the credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under the facility to million the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million and a letter of credit facility in an aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not to exceed million 
for more information on our credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
under the credit facility  certain of our corporate activities are restricted  which include  among other things  limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and acquisitions  payment of dividends  stock repurchases and redemptions  incurrence of additional indebtedness  making of loans and investments  creation of liens  prepayment of other indebtedness  and engaging in certain transactions with affiliates 
any event of default under the credit facility or agreements governing our other significant indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under the credit facility or other debt instruments that contain cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay amounts due under the credit facility and the other debt securities then accelerated 
if we cannot generate positive cash flow from our operations  we eventually may not be able to service our indebtedness 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend primarily upon our future ability to generate positive cash flow from operations 
if we cannot generate positive cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of any indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations would be materially affected 
we may be unable to obtain new surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees in support of client engagements on acceptable terms 
some of our clients  primarily in the state and local market  require us to obtain surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees in support of client engagements 
we may be required to post additional collateral cash or letters of credit to support our obligations under our surety bonds upon the demand of our surety providers 
if we cannot obtain or maintain surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees on acceptable terms  we may be unable to maintain existing client engagements or to obtain additional client engagements that require them 
in turn  our current and planned revenue  particularly from our public services business  could be materially and adversely affected 
downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our borrowing costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
on february   standard poor s rating services standard poor s withdrew our senior unsecured rating of b and our subordinated debt rating of ccc and removed them from creditwatch 
separately  on october   moody s downgraded our corporate family rating to b from b and the ratings for two of our subordinated convertible bonds series to b from b  and placed our ratings on review for further downgrade 
actions such as those by the rating agencies may affect our ability to obtain financing or the terms on which such financing may be obtained 
our inability to obtain additional financing  or obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  could hinder our ability to fund general corporate requirements  affect our stock price  limit our ability to compete for new business  and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 
our leverage may adversely affect our business and financial performance and may restrict our operating flexibility 
the level of our indebtedness and our ongoing cash flow requirements for debt services could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as capital expenditures  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital or capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because borrowings may be at variable rates of interest  which could result in high interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
the holders of our debentures have the right  at their option  to require us to purchase some or all of their debentures upon certain dates or upon the occurrence of certain designated events  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we have made two issuances of convertible subordinated debentures and two issuances of convertible senior subordinated debentures 
for a description of these debentures  see item  market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities sales of securities not registered under the securities act 
the holders of our debentures have the right to require us to repurchase any outstanding debentures upon certain dates and designated events 
these events include certain change of control transactions and a termination of trading  which occurs if the company s common stock is no longer listed for trading on a us national securities exchange 
if we are unable to repurchase any of our debentures when due or otherwise breach any other debenture covenants  we may be in default under the related indentures  which could lead to an acceleration of unpaid principal and accrued interest under the indentures 
any such acceleration could lead to an acceleration of amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
in the event of any acceleration of unpaid principal and accrued interest under our credit facility or under the debentures  we will not be permitted to make payments to the holders of the debentures until the unpaid principal and accrued interest under our credit facility have been fully paid 
risks that relate to our common stock the price of our common stock may decline due to the number of shares that may be available for sale in the future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding convertible debt and warrants  we will issue the following number of shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution protection and other adjustments  including upon certain change of control transactions initial per share total conversion initial approximate price exercise conversion number of convertible debt and warrants price dates shares million series a convertible subordinated debentures due none million million series b convertible subordinated debentures due none million million convertible senior subordinated debentures due april  million million convertible senior subordinated debentures due july  million warrants issued in connection with the july senior debentures july  million total million the holders of the series a debentures and series b debentures have the right to convert the debentures into shares of common stock only upon the occurrence of certain triggering events 
as a result of our continuing delay in becoming current in our sec periodic filings  we are not able to file a registration statement covering the shares issuable upon conversion of any of the debentures or exercise of the july warrants 
once such a registration statement is effective  more of the shares associated with such debentures and warrants may be sold 
any sales in the public market of such shares of common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  under certain circumstances  the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the price of our stock 
as of march   our employees held stock options to purchase million shares  representing approximately of the  company s shares of common stock then outstanding and of which million shares are currently vested 
an additional number of stock options generally will become exercisable during the calendar years indicated below exercise price number of shares range average calendar year remainder of since we have significantly increased the issuance of equity in the form of restricted stock units rsus and psus collectively  stock units to managing directors and other key employees  as a means of better aligning the interests of these employees with our shareholders and to enhance the retention of current managing directors 
as of march   an aggregate of million rsus and million psus  net of forfeitures  were issued and outstanding  respectively 
the following shares of common stock are expected to be delivered upon settlement of these stock units during the calendar years indicated below assuming settlement of the psus at vesting in number of shares calendar year and thereafter because we are not current in our sec periodic filings  we are unable to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock 
consequently  we have not issued shares under our espp or ltip since january and april  respectively  and significant features of many of our employee equity plans remain suspended 
we expect that once we are current in our sec periodic filings and we are able to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock  our employees may wish to sell a significant number of these shares of common stock  which could materially depress the price of our common stock 
based on the accumulated contributions and the closing price of our common stock as of march   approximately million shares would have been purchased through our espp as of such date if we could have issued shares under the espp 
we are considering exercising various rights that we have to stagger the settlement of outstanding  vested stock units once we become current in our sec periodic filings  however  these alternatives may not be well received by our employees 
we have no comparable right to defer settlement of shares due under our espp 
there are significant limitations on the ability of any person or company to acquire the company without the approval of our board of directors 
we have adopted a stockholders rights plan 
under this plan  after the occurrence of specified events that may result in a change of control  our stockholders will be able to purchase stock from us or our successor at half the then current market price 
this right will not extend  however  to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors or to persons whom our board of directors determines to be adverse to the interests of the stockholders 
accordingly  this plan could deter takeover attempts 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contains provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions include the following  among others our board of directors is classified into three classes  each of which will serve for staggered three year terms  a director may be removed by our stockholders only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of two thirds of our voting stock  only our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders  our stockholders may not take action by written consent  our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to place stockholders proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of the stockholders  if stockholder approval is required by applicable law  any mergers  consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of our voting stock  and our stockholders may amend or repeal any of the foregoing provisions of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws only by a vote of two thirds of our voting stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our properties consist of leased office facilities for specific client contracts and for sales  support  research and development  consulting  administrative and other professional personnel 
our corporate headquarters consists of approximately  square feet in mclean  virginia 
as of december   we occupied approximately additional offices in the united states and approximately offices in latin america  canada  the asia pacific region and emea 
all office space referred to above is leased pursuant to operating leases that expire over various periods during the next years 
portions of our office space are sublet under operating lease agreements  which expire over various periods during the next years and are also being marketed for sublease or disposition 
although we believe our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future  our business requires that our lease holdings accommodate the dynamic needs of our various consulting engagements and  given business demands  the makeup of our leasehold portfolio may change within the next twelve month period to address these demands 
in may  in connection with the settlement of our dispute with kpmg llp kpmg regarding the transition services agreement entered into with kpmg in connection with our initial public offering  we amended certain real estate documents relating to a number of properties that we currently sublet from kpmg to either allow us to further sublease these properties to third parties  or to return certain properties we no longer utilize to kpmg  in return for a reduction of the amount of our sublease obligations to kpmg for those properties 
item legal proceedings overview we currently are a party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings 
generally  there are three types of legal proceedings to which we have been made a party claims and investigations arising from our continuing inability to timely file periodic reports under the exchange act  and the restatement of our financial statements for certain prior periods to correct accounting errors and departures from generally accepted accounting principles for those years sec reporting matters  claims and investigations being conducted by agencies or officers of the us federal government and arising in connection with our provision of services under contracts with agencies of the us federal government government contracting matters  and claims made in the ordinary course of business by clients seeking damages for alleged breaches of contract or failure of performance  by current or former employees seeking damages for alleged acts of wrongful termination or discrimination  and by creditors or other vendors alleging defaults in payment or performance other matters 
we currently maintain insurance in types and amounts customary in our industry  including coverage for professional liability  general liability and management and director liability 
based on management s current assessment and insurance coverages believed to be available  we believe that the company s financial statements include adequate provision for estimated losses that are likely to be incurred with regard to all matters of the types described above 
sec reporting matters class action suits 
in and after april  various separate complaints were filed in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia  alleging that the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors violated section b of the exchange act  rule b promulgated thereunder and section a of the exchange act by  among other things  making materially misleading statements between august  and april  with respect to our financial results in our sec filings and press releases 
on january   the court certified a class  appointed class counsel and appointed a class representative 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on march  and the defendants  including the company  subsequently filed a motion to dismiss that complaint  which was fully briefed and heard on may  we were awaiting a ruling when  on march   the court stayed the case  pending the us supreme court s decision in the case of makor issues rights  ltd v 
tellabs  argued before the supreme court on march  on june   the supreme court issued its opinion in the tellabs case  holding that to plead a strong inference of a defendant s fraudulent intent under the applicable federal securities laws  a plaintiff must demonstrate that such an inference is not merely reasonable  but cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of non fraudulent intent 
the supreme court decision is expected to significantly inform the court s decision regarding the complaint and our motion to dismiss the complaint 
it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not we will ultimately be successful in this matter or  if not  what the impact might be 
shareholder s derivative demand 
on may   we received a letter from counsel representing one of our shareholders requesting that we initiate a lawsuit against our board of directors and certain present and former officers of the company  alleging breaches of the officers and directors duties of care and loyalty to the company relating to the events disclosed in our report filed on form k  dated april  on january   the shareholder filed a derivative complaint in the circuit court of fairfax county  virginia  that was not served on the company until march the shareholder s complaint alleged that his demand was not acted upon and alleged the breach of fiduciary duty claims previously stated in his demand 
the complaint also included a non derivative claim seeking the scheduling of an annual meeting in on may   following an extensive audit committee investigation  our board of directors responded to the shareholder s demand by declining at that time to file a suit alleging the claims asserted in the shareholder s demand 
the shareholder did not amend the complaint to reflect the refusal of his demand 
we filed demurrers on august   which effectively sought to dismiss the matter related to the fiduciary duty claims 
on november   the court granted the demurrers and dismissed the fiduciary claims  with leave to file amended claims 
as a result of our annual meeting of stockholders held on december   the claim seeking the scheduling of an annual meeting became moot 
on january   the plaintiff filed an amended derivative complaint re asserting the previously dismissed derivative claims and alleging that the board s refusal of his demand was not in good faith 
the company s renewed motion to dismiss all remaining claims was heard on march  and no ruling has yet been entered 
sec investigation 
on april   pursuant to the same matter number as its inquiry concerning our restatement of certain financial statements issued in  the staff of the sec s division of enforcement requested information and documents relating to our march  form k 
on september   we announced that the staff had issued a formal order of investigation in this matter 
we subsequently have received subpoenas from the staff seeking production of documents and information  including certain information and documents related to an investigation conducted by our audit committee 
we continue to provide information and documents to the sec as requested 
the investigation is ongoing and the sec is in the process of taking the testimony of a number of our current and former employees  as well as one of our former directors 
in connection with the investigation by our audit committee  we became aware of incidents of possible non compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and our internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in china and voluntarily reported these matters to the sec and us department of justice in november both the sec and the department of justice are investigating these matters in connection with the formal investigation described above 
on march   we received a subpoena from the sec regarding information related to these matters 
government contracting matters california subpoenas 
in december  we were served with a subpoena by the grand jury for the united states district court for the central district of california 
the subpoena sought records relating to twelve contracts between the company and the us federal government  including two general service administration gsa schedules  as well as other documents and records relating to our us federal government work 
we have produced documents in accordance with an agreement with the assistant us attorney 
the focus of the review is upon our billing and time expense practices  as well as alliance agreements where referral or commission payments were permitted 
in july  we received a subpoena by the us army related to department of defense contracts 
we subsequently were served with several subpoenas issued by the inspectors general of the gsa and the department of defense 
these subpoenas are largely duplicative of the grand jury subpoena 
in december  the company s counsel was informally informed by the assistant us attorney involved in this matter that the government has declined to pursue any criminal proceedings arising out of this matter 
the government continues to pursue the investigation on the civil side 
we continue to cooperate fully and have produced substantial amounts of documents and other information 
at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of the investigation 
core financial logistics system 
there is an ongoing investigation of the core financial logistics system corefls project by the inspector general s office of the department of veterans affairs and by the assistant us attorney for the central district of florida 
to date  we have been issued three subpoenas  in june  december and may  seeking the production of documents relating to the corefls project 
we are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents in response to the subpoenas 
to date  there have been no specific allegations of criminal or fraudulent conduct on our part or any contractual claims filed against us by the veterans administration in connection with the project 
we continue to believe we have complied with all of our obligations under the corefls contract 
we cannot  however  predict the outcome of the inquiry 
other matters peregrine litigation 
we were named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits regarding certain software resale transactions with peregrine systems  inc during the period and  in which purchasers and other individuals who acquired peregrine stock alleged that we participated in or aided and abetted a fraudulent scheme by peregrine to inflate peregrine s stock price  and we were also sued by a trustee succeeding the interests of peregrine for the same conduct 
in december  we executed conditional settlement agreements whereby we were released from liability in these matters and in all claims for indemnity by kpmg  our former parent  in each of these cases 
we issued settlement payments of approximately million with respect to these matters in september in addition  on january   we finalized an agreement with kpmg  providing conditional mutual releases to each other from fee advancement and indemnification claims with respect to these matters  with no settlement payment or other exchange of monies between the parties 
we did not settle the in re peregrine systems  inc securities litigation and on january   the matter was dismissed by the trial court as it relates to us 
the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal and briefing of the appeal has been completed 
to the extent that any judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiffs against kpmg  kpmg has notified us that it will seek indemnification for any such sums 
the company disputes kpmg s entitlement to any such indemnification 
on november   larry rodda  a former employee  pled guilty to one count of criminal conspiracy in connection with the peregrine software resale transactions that continue to be the subject of the government inquiries 
mr 
rodda also was named in a civil suit brought by the sec 
we were not named in the indictment or civil suit  and are cooperating with the government investigations 
series b debenture suit 
on september   certain holders of our series b convertible subordinated debentures the series b debentures provided a purported notice of default to us based upon our failure to timely file certain of our sec periodic reports due in thereafter  these holders asserted that as a result  the principal amount of the series b debentures  accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid damages were due and payable immediately 
the indenture trustee for the series b debentures then brought suit against us and  on september   the supreme court of new york ruled on motion that we were in default under the indenture for the series b debentures and ordered that the amount of damages be determined subsequently at trial 
we believed the ruling to be in error and on september   appealed the court s ruling and moved for summary judgment on the matter of determination of damages 
after further negotiations  we and the relevant holders of our series b debentures entered into a first supplemental indenture the first supplemental indenture with the bank of new york  as trustee  which amends the subordinated indenture governing our series a convertible subordinated debentures due the series a debentures and the series b debentures 
concurrently  we and the relevant holders of our series b debentures lawsuit agreed to discontinue the lawsuit 
the first supplemental indenture modifies the debentures to include i a waiver of our sec reporting requirements under the subordinated indenture through october   ii the interest rate payable on all series a debentures from per annum to per annum until december   and iii adjustment of the interest rate payable on all series b debentures from per annum to per annum until december  in order to address any possibility of a claim of cross default  on november   we entered into a first supplemental indenture with the bank of new york  as trustee  which amends the indenture governing our convertible senior subordinated debentures due the supplemental indenture includes a waiver of our sec reporting requirements through october  and provides for further extension through october  upon our payment of an additional fee of of the principal amount of the debentures 
we paid to certain consenting holders of these debentures a consent fee equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures 
in addition  on november   we entered into an agreement with the holders of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due july  pursuant to which we paid a consent fee equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures  in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement governing the issuance of these debentures

this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
overview we provide strategic consulting applications services  technology solutions and managed services to government organizations  global companies and medium sized businesses in the united states and internationally 
in north america  we provide consulting services through our public services  commercial services and financial services industry groups in which we focus significant industry specific knowledge and service offerings to our clients 
outside of north america  we are organized on a geographic basis  with operations in emea  the asia pacific region and latin america 
we have started the transition of our business to a more integrated  global delivery model 
in  we created a global account management program and a global solutions council represented by all of our industry groups that will focus on identifying opportunities for globalized solutions suites 
our global delivery centers continue to grow  both in terms of personnel and the percentage of work they provide to our business units 
economic and industry factors we believe that our clients spending for consulting services is partially correlated to  among other factors  the performance of the domestic and global economy as measured by a variety of indicators such as gross domestic product  government policies  mergers and acquisitions activity  corporate earnings  us federal and state government budget levels  inflation and interest rates and client confidence levels  among others 
as economic uncertainties increase  clients interests in business and technology consulting historically have turned more to improving existing processes and reducing costs rather than investing in new innovations 
demand for our services  as evidenced by new contract bookings  also does not uniformly follow changes in economic cycles 
consequently  we may experience rapid decreases in new contract bookings at the onset of significant economic downturns while the benefits of economic recovery may take longer to realize 
the markets in which we provide services are increasingly competitive and global in nature 
while supply and demand in certain lines of business and geographies may support price increases for some of our standard service offerings from time to time  to maintain and improve our profitability we must constantly seek to improve and expand our unique service offerings and deliver our services at increasingly lower cost levels 
our public services industry group  which is our largest  also must operate within the us federal  state and local government markets where unique contracting  budgetary and regulatory regimes control how contracts are awarded  modified and terminated 
budgetary constraints or reductions in government funding may result in the modification or termination of long term government contracts  which could dramatically affect the outlook of that business 
revenue and income drivers we derive substantially all of our revenue from professional services activities 
our revenue is driven by our ability to continuously generate new opportunities to serve clients  by the prices we obtain for our service offerings  and by the size and utilization of our professional workforce 
our ability to generate new business is directly influenced by the economic conditions in the industries and regions we serve  our anticipation and response to technological change  the type and level of technology spending by our clients and by our clients perception of the quality of our work 
our ability to generate new business is also indirectly and increasingly influenced by our clients perceptions of our ability to manage our ongoing issues surrounding our financial accounting  internal controls and sec reporting capabilities 
our gross profit consists of revenue less our costs of service 
the primary components of our costs of service include professional compensation and other direct contract expenses 
professional compensation consists of payroll costs and related benefits associated with client service professional staff including the vesting of various stock awards  tax equalization for employees on foreign and long term domestic assignments and costs associated with reductions in workforce 
other direct contract expenses include costs directly attributable to client engagements 
these costs include out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software  and costs of subcontractors 
if we are unable to adequately control or estimate these costs  or properly anticipate the sizes of our client service and support staff  our profitability will suffer 
our operating profit reflects our revenue less costs of service and certain additional items that include  primarily  sg a expenses  which include costs related to marketing  information systems  depreciation and amortization  finance and accounting  human resources  sales force  and other expenses related to managing and growing our business 
write downs in the carrying value of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets have also reduced our operating profit 
our operating cash flow is derived predominantly from gross operating profit and how we manage our receivables and payables 
key performance indicators in evaluating our operating performance and financial condition  we focus on the following key performance indicators bookings  revenue growth  gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue  utilization  days sales outstanding  free cash flow and attrition 
bookings 
we believe that information regarding our new contract bookings provides useful trend information regarding how the volume of our new business changes over time 
comparing the amount of new contract bookings and revenue provides us with an additional measure of the short term sustainability of revenue growth 
information regarding our new bookings should not be compared to  or substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 
these amounts represent our estimate at contract signing of the net revenue expected over the term of that contract and involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
bookings do not include potential revenue that could be earned from a client relationship as a result of future expansion of service offerings to that client  nor does it reflect option years under contracts that are subject to client discretion 
in addition  government contracts or work orders are not included in bookings until related appropriations spending has been properly approved and  then  only to the extent of the amount of spending approved 
consequently  there can be significant differences between the times of contract signing and new contract booking recognition 
although our level of bookings provides an indication of how our business is performing  we do not characterize our bookings  or our engagement contracts associated with new bookings  as backlog because our engagements generally can be cancelled or terminated on short notice or without notice 
revenue growth 
unlike bookings  which provide only a general sense of future expectations  period over period comparisons of revenue provide a meaningful depiction of how successful we have been in growing our business over time 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
gross margin is a meaningful tool for monitoring our ability to control our costs of services 
analysis of the various cost elements  including professional compensation expense  effects of foreign exchange rate changes and the use of subcontractors  as a percentage of revenue over time can provide additional information as to the key challenges we are facing in our business 
the cost of subcontractors is generally more expensive than the cost of our own workforce and can negatively impact our gross profit 
while the use of subcontractors can help us to win larger  more complex deals  and also may be mandated by our clients  we focus on limiting the use of subcontractors whenever possible in order to minimize our costs 
we also utilize certain adjusted gross margin metrics in connection with the vesting and settlement of certain employee incentive awards 
for a discussion of these metrics  see item  executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis 
utilization 
utilization represents the percentage of time our consultants are performing work  and is defined as total hours charged to client engagement or to non chargeable client relationship projects divided by total available hours for any specific time period  net of holiday and paid vacation hours 
in  we changed how we define utilization to make this metric more consistent with how we believe our industry peer group measures this metric 
utilization percentages for set forth herein have been adjusted to conform to this new definition 
days sales outstanding dso 
dso is an operational metric that approximates the amount of earned revenue that remains unpaid by clients at a given time 
dsos are derived by dividing the sum of our outstanding accounts receivable and unbilled revenue  less deferred revenue  by our average net revenue per day 
average net revenue per day is determined by dividing total net revenue for the most recently ended trailing twelve month period by free cash flow 
free cash flow is calculated by subtracting purchases of property and equipment from cash provided by operating activities 
we believe free cash flow is a useful measure because it allows better understanding and assessment of our ability to meet debt service requirements and the amount of recurring cash generated from operations after expenditures for fixed assets 
free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt 
we use free cash flow as a measure of recurring operating cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure 
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap is net cash provided by operating activities 
attrition 
attrition  or voluntary total employee turnover  is calculated by dividing the number of our employees who have chosen to leave the company within a certain period by the total average number of all employees during that same period 
our attrition statistic covers all of our employees  which we believe provides metrics that are more compatible with  and comparable to  those of our competitors 
readers should understand that each of the performance indicators identified above are utilized by many companies in our industry and by those who follow our industry 
there are no uniform standards or requirements for computing these performance indicators  and  consequently  our computations of these amounts may not be comparable to those of our competitors 
highlights in  we were able to sustain our underlying operations and our core business continued to perform  despite the issues we continue to face with respect to our financial accounting systems and efforts to become timely in our sec periodic reports 
we began to see the benefits of restructuring efforts undertaken in previous years  particularly in our asia pacific and emea industry groups  as well as management actions aimed at improving our profitability 
these benefits allowed us to show significant improvements in gross profit and net income loss while maintaining relatively constant year over year levels of bookings and revenue 
we were also successful in resolving and settling a number of long running contractual disputes 
we were able to achieve these results despite increasing pricing pressures and competition for the retention of skilled personnel two current industry wide phenomena that affect us more acutely due to our continuing efforts to timely produce our financial statements and file our periodic reports with the sec 
we continue to be uniquely challenged in these regards and by persisting negative perceptions regarding our financial position that may have been  in our opinion  unjustifiably increased by our settlement of a vigorously contested lawsuit initiated by several holders of our series b debentures 
of particular note in are the following new contract bookings for were  million  a slight decrease from new contract bookings of  million for we experienced strong bookings growth in all of our industry groups other than commercial services and financial services  with the most notable growth in our emea and public services industry groups 
commercial services bookings were significantly lower when compared year over year  primarily due to bookings in excess of million related to the signing of our contract with hawaiian telcom communications  inc the ht contract  one of the largest contracts in our history 
the short term uncertainty and confusion precipitated by the dispute with certain holders of our series b debentures also appears to have had some temporary effect on bookings during the fourth quarter of  particularly in our financial services business unit  which resulted in a year over year decrease in bookings for that business unit and can be expected to impact its revenue in early new contract bookings for the three months ended march  were approximately million  compared with new contract bookings of million for the three months ended march  bookings growth in our international operations was not sufficient to offset contraction in our north american industry groups 
in north america  public service bookings appear to have been impacted by increasing uncertainty surrounding the timing of approval of various federal contract appropriations being precipitated by various factors  including ongoing congressional debates regarding military operations in iraq and afghanistan and the federal budget 
year over year decreases in public services bookings for the three months ended march  are substantially attributable to growth in the first quarter of of the total contract value of new federal contracts signed for which appropriations approval remained pending unfunded federal contracts at march  we do not record unfunded federal contracts as new contract bookings while appropriation approvals remain pending as there can be no assurances that these approvals will be forthcoming in the near future  if at all 
public services bookings were also affected by one exceptionally large booking in our state  local and education sled sector in the first quarter of outside of our public services business unit  new contract bookings in north america were also negatively affected by commercial clients segregating larger projects into series of smaller work orders 
our revenue for was  million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenue of  million 
significant revenue increases in asia pacific  public services and emea were substantially offset by commercial services revenue declines and reversals attributable to the settlement of disputes with two significant telecommunications industry clients 
our gross profit for was million  compared to million for gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to during from during revenue increases  as well as reductions in professional compensation expense and other direct contract expenses  were relatively equal contributors to this improvement 
during and  we worked with hawaiian telcom communications  inc  a telecommunications industry client ht  to resolve issues relating to our delivery of services for the design  build and operation of various information technology systems 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement and transition agreement with ht 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we paid million  million of which was paid by certain of our insurers 
in addition  we waived approximately million of invoices and other amounts otherwise payable by ht to the company 
the transition agreement governed our transitioning of the remaining work under the ht contract to a successor provider  which has been completed 
in and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  under the ht contract 
on june   we entered into a settlement with a telecommunications industry client resolving the client s claims under a client initiated audit of certain of the company s time and expense charges relating to an engagement that closed in in connection with the settlement  we will make six equal annual payments to the client in an aggregate amount of million  with the first payment made on the signing date in return for a full release of the client s claims 
while this settlement provides us with the opportunity to perform services for this client in the future  the dispute has and will likely continue to negatively affect the level of new bookings anticipated from this client in on may   we settled certain disputes with kpmg that had arisen between our companies related to the february transition services agreement 
kpmg had asserted that we were liable to it for approximately million under the transition services agreement for certain technology service termination costs 
while neither company admitted any liability under these claims  these claims were mutually released 
in addition  we agreed to amend a number of real estate subleases between kpmg and bearingpoint  and consent to the further subletting of others 
the settlement further involves cash payments by us to kpmg of million over a three year time frame 
we incurred sg a expenses of million in  representing a decrease of million  or  from sg a expenses of million in while we achieved costs savings by reducing the size of our sales force and other business development expenses  these cost savings were significantly offset by continuing increases in our finance and accounting costs  primarily for sub contracted labor and other costs related to the closing of our financial statements  and charges related to our agreement with yale university 
during  we incurred external costs related to the closing of our financial statements of approximately million  compared to approximately million for we currently expect our costs for related to these efforts to be approximately million 
for  we decided to allocate million among our managing directors as a performance cash bonus because i we had not previously paid performance based bonuses to our managing directors and desired to begin implementing our pay for performance philosophy  ii we were able to sustain our underlying operations and our core business continued to perform  despite the issues we continue to face with respect to our financial accounting systems and efforts to become timely in our sec periodic reports  and iii we were unable to provide for bonuses under the md compensation plan 
bonuses were not paid under the md compensation plan because the plan has not yet been fully activated and the target levels of profitability set forth under the plan were not achieved due to our ongoing issues related to our financial accounting systems and internal controls and their related impact on our ability to become timely in our sec periodic reports and deliver shares of common stock under equity based awards 
the amount of the bonus was determined by giving consideration to  and was partially covered by  the total base compensation we budgeted for payment to our managing directors for the total bonus exceeded the actual amount of compensation that would have been paid to our managing directors for by million 
management believes the million increase in gross profit across all industry groups justified payment of these amounts 
for  while all of our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting cited for remain  we have remediated certain aspects of these material weaknesses  and improvements in our internal control over financial reporting continue 
over the course of  we undertook significant remediation efforts  which reduced the total numbers of deficiencies and material weaknesses that continue to contribute to the material weaknesses in our internal control environment by and  respectively 
senior management implemented and caused to be sustained significant changes to personnel  including finance and accounting personnel in our corporate offices  processes and policies and have communicated the importance of our standards of business conduct and ethics  and the importance of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  senior management caused to be implemented policies and processes and other mechanisms around the identification of our long term assignment personnel in the united states and the accuracy and completeness of the related financial accounts 
in  we realized a net loss of million  or a loss of per share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per share  in the decline in net loss in as compared to is attributable to several factors  including our gross profit across all industry groups in improved over our gross profit by million  we did not have a goodwill impairment charge in  compared to a million goodwill impairment charge incurred in  we recorded million in for an insurance settlement in connection with our settlement with ht  and our income tax provision for was lower than our income tax provision for  as the amount included a million increase to valuation allowance primarily against our us deferred tax assets 
contributing to the net loss for were million of losses related to the previously mentioned settlements with telecommunication clients  million for bonuses payable to our employees  million of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of stock based awards  million of lease and facilities restructuring charges and the previously mentioned million year over year increase in external costs related to the closing of our financial statements 
utilization for was  compared with in utilization for the three months ended march  was 
free cash flow for and was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by and used in operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment in and were million and million  respectively 
the change in free cash flow for compared to resulted primarily from the following we lowered our dsos through enhancements in our cash collections efforts 
at december   our dsos stood at days  representing a decrease of days  or  from our dsos at december  our continued focus on this metric during improved our free cash flow by million as compared to  we experienced higher operating profitability in our business  as evidenced by the sharp decline in operating loss for as compared to  and we experienced greater cash outflows in due to payments made for professional services and related expenses accrued under the ht contract during  and in connection with our settlement with peregrine systems  inc in november  we settled litigation with certain holders of our series b debentures who had alleged that we were in default under the applicable indenture as a result of our failure to timely provide certain sec periodic reports to the trustee 
although we continue to believe we were not in default under the applicable indenture  and a subsequent court s decision has provided support for our belief  this dispute exemplifies some of the recurring challenges presented to the growth of our business by the continuation of our inability to timely file our sec periodic reports 
we continue to be guardedly optimistic that achieving our goal of becoming current in our sec periodic reports in and beginning to timely file our sec periodic reports in will help alleviate some of the business pressures we have recently experienced in this regard 
in  we continued to focus on enhancing our global operations model 
we launched an on line  centrally managed strategy and operating manual that standardizes and centralizes our operating processes and procedures  including legal and financial compliance procedures 
we also created improved contracting procedures that will be implemented in the second half of  which will provide additional references  resources and rigor around the contracting process 
we also established a global account management program and governance structure that will focus on the identification and management of key global accounts and a global solutions council represented by all of our industry groups that will focus on identifying opportunities for globalized solution suites 
in  we increased the use of lower cost resources  both offshore china and india and domestically hattiesburg  mississippi 
we focused our global delivery centers on developing specific skills and capabilities that would enhance our delivery capabilities 
in  we opened new facilities in bangalore  india to expand our offshore footprint in an increasingly competitive market 
in  we will continue to optimize our global delivery model to improve our cost structure for our clients  and we expect to continue to aggressively increase the number of engagement hours delivered through our global delivery centers 
in the first half of  we hired a new general counsel and chief compliance officer  each with significant prior regulatory and compliance experience 
we have strengthened our compliance programs by restructuring and centralizing our compliance efforts under our chief compliance officer  developing and implementing in firm wide enhanced compliance training with respect to the foreign corrupt practices act the initial roll out of which was completed by over of our workforce  adopting in a new standards of business conduct based on best industry practices to replace our prior code of business conduct and ethics and creating in a compliance committee comprised of members of our senior management whose focus will be to properly organize and allocate the necessary resources to address broader  company wide compliance efforts 
during  we spent approximately million related to the maintenance of our existing north american financial reporting systems and the preparation of our transition to new north american financial reporting systems 
we finalized decisions regarding the design of  and obtained licenses for the components needed to substantially replace  our north american financial reporting systems 
for additional information regarding the transformation of our north american financial reporting systems  see principal business priorities for and beyond 
during  we completed the deployment of our program control function  composed of approximately accounting professionals  designed to support the completeness and accuracy of engagement accounting details in north america 
this function is designed to build effective financial controls into the lifecycle of a contract by supporting the timely assembly and review of revenue recognition  engagement close out and other contract cost elements as part of our daily operations 
the success of this function will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to attract and retain qualified finance professionals  the implementation of an effective control environment over client contract accounting and the development of financial systems  and the acceptance and utilization of these systems by our managing directors  to support the function 
as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  including approximately  consulting professionals  which represented a decrease in billable headcount of approximately from full time employees and consulting professionals at december  of  and  respectively 
as of march   we had approximately  full time employees  including approximately  consulting professionals 
our voluntary  annualized attrition rate for was  compared to for the highly competitive industry in which we operate  and our continuing issues related to our north american financial reporting systems and internal controls  have made it particularly critical and challenging for us to attract and retain experienced personnel 
our voluntary  annualized attrition rate for the three months ended march  was  compared to our voluntary annualized attrition rate of for the three months ended march  in november  we began our partnership with yale university to create the bearingpoint leadership program at yale school of management  an innovative education and training program focusing on career and leadership development for our employees 
participants are taught a curriculum jointly developed by a faculty composed of both yale professors and bearingpoint specialists  including a consulting skills workshop for experienced professionals and management skills training for newly hired or promoted managers and managing directors 
we believe that our collaboration with yale will offer our employees and new recruits with a unique learning experience that will help improve our ability to recruit and retain talented and motivated employees  provide them with the skills and training that will enhance the delivery of services to our clients and cultivate a shared set of values  skills and culture that we hope will come to define a career with us 
furthermore  we believe that our relationship with a top tier university will augment our brand and enhance our recruiting opportunities 
in april  the us defense contract audit agency dcaa issued a report on its audit of our financial capability  which concluded that our financial condition is acceptable for performing government contracts 
the dcaa examined our financial condition and capability to determine if we have adequate financial resources to perform government contracts in the current and near term up to one year 
we expect that after the filing of this annual report on form k  the dcaa will begin a new audit of our financial capability  to re assess our financial condition 
as previously reported  in may  the dcaa issued a report on its audit of our control environment and overall accounting systems controls  which audit began in the dcaa report concluded that our accounting system was inadequate in part  meaning that our system is adequate for government contracting 
the dcaa report contained four condition statements  the most material of which relates to our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the sec 
the remaining three condition statements have been significantly or completely remediated 
on february   standard poor s rating services standard poor s withdrew our senior unsecured rating of b and our subordinated debt rating of ccc and removed us from creditwatch  in accordance with its policy of withdrawing ratings for companies that have not been current in their sec filings for an extended period of time 
separately  on october   moody s downgraded our corporate family rating to b from b and the ratings for two of our subordinated convertible bonds series to b from b  and placed our ratings on review for further downgrade 
principal business priorities for and beyond in early  our board of directors determined that our principal business priorities are enhance shareholder value  become timely in our financial and sec periodic reporting  replace our north american financial reporting systems  reduce employee attrition  increase client awareness  confidence and satisfaction  and strengthen our balance sheet 
identified below are management s current and planned initiatives to achieve the priorities established by our board of directors 
enhance shareholder value 
we recognize that shareholder value is measured in bottom line results 
we are also keenly aware that to improve shareholder value in the coming years we must focus not only on improving our business model  but also on becoming timely and economical in producing our financial statements and periodic reports 
our initiatives related to improving our business model include focus on larger and more profitable clients and projects 
we must continue to focus our sales efforts on more profitable and growing client accounts and projects 
our long term clients continue to predominate our revenue base  and we intend to prioritize our efforts around deepening these relationships 
with respect to smaller projects  we are standardizing our approach so as to either increase their profitability or avoid adding them to our portfolio 
a key factor in returning to positive cash flow from operations will be our ability to significantly reduce our sg a expenses associated with marginally profitable opportunities 
focus on strengths and specialization 
we are seeking to improve the clarity of our business strategy by requiring our industry groups and managed services teams to further refine their respective areas of focus in terms of exclusively targeted segments  industries and offerings  and to more clearly differentiate their products and services 
increase use of offshore services 
we are continuing to increase the use of lower cost resources both offshore china and india and domestically hattiesburg  mississippi to support engagement work 
our emea practice is also exploring central european near shore capabilities 
our ability to counter the increasing success of offshore service providers in gaining market share in lower margin  high volume market offerings will continue to depend on our ability to achieve our strategy of leveraging our comparatively limited network of global delivery centers and lower cost resources  with the goal of sustaining profitable growth in more sophisticated  strategic and transformational type engagements 
while we had some success in this area in  in order to continue to be able to combat increasing competition  we must continue to show improvements in both increasing the volume of our services delivered offshore and maintaining our margins on that work 
leverage project management and reduce cost of delivery 
we are leveraging our workforce more effectively by improving our managing director to staff ratio on projects from as of march  to as of december  we continue to seek to improve this ratio in and beyond 
we also are implementing stricter criteria concerning the use of subcontractors to reduce our use of subcontractors and drive greater utilization of internal resources 
utilize professional services staff more efficiently 
we are striving to become more efficient in recruiting  training and utilizing our professional services staff 
historically  we have faced challenges associated with transitioning employees from completed projects to new engagements  forecasting demand for our services  maintaining an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  and managing attrition 
our current staffing and  hence  recruiting efforts are managed on an industry group basis 
we must continue to focus on improving both the processes and systems surrounding recruiting individuals with the right skill sets and staffing client engagements globally in a more efficient manner 
we are actively seeking and soon hope to hire an experienced human resources executive to reinvigorate and redesign our human resources function 
manage by standardized metrics 
our new chief operating officer is implementing a standardized key performance indicator scorecard for all industry groups and segments that will reinforce consistent management reporting 
improve risk management processes 
we have now implemented engagement risk management processes at both business unit and firm wide levels to better evaluate prospective engagement and execution risks 
through these steps we intend to implement specific operations procedures to be utilized within our industry groups and deal review procedures to review significant proposals and contracts 
our legal team is completing a review of the terms of our larger  more risky engagements  the results of which will be used to conduct periodic deal assessments and reviews throughout the course of these engagements 
reduce cost and improve quality of corporate services 
we continue to aggressively explore cost reduction opportunities to move non core administrative activities offshore 
in  we also plan to reduce our infrastructure costs by eliminating costs associated with previous revenue recognition processes with the full deployment of our program control function  reducing employee attrition  thereby reducing related costs relating to hiring and exiting employees  reducing our reliance on external consultants  and consolidating our information technology hosting providers 
become timely in our financial and sec periodic reporting 
becoming timely and more economical in producing accurate financial statements and sec periodic reports is critical to our ability to enhance shareholder value in the coming years 
while our objective is to complete our financial statements for the third quarter of and become current in our sec periodic reporting with the filing of our quarterly report on form q for that period with the sec  in order to sustain accurate and timely production of our financial statements and timely file our sec periodic reports  we must dramatically reduce the amount of time required to conduct our periodic financial closing process 
though we continue to incrementally improve on the amount of time required to conduct this process  we will not be able to fully minimize that amount of time until we have remediated the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and fully transitioned to our new north american financial reporting systems 
we currently do not anticipate full remediation of all material weaknesses until after significant analysis and debate  we have decided that we must prioritize our efforts to achieve and sustain timely financial and sec periodic reporting in and early  even as we continue to remediate our existing material weaknesses 
the consequences of this decision are that we will need to continue to utilize our existing north american financial reporting systems longer than we previously planned and  during this time  we will need to rely heavily on our client engagement teams to fully accept and utilize the tools and resources we have provided them to build effective controls into the lifecycle of our contracts and assemble and review client contract accounting information on a timely basis as part of our daily operations  rather than subsequent to the end of the relevant financial reporting period 
while we remain confident with the proposed design for our new north american financial reporting systems  as well as our decision to transition to these systems as a longer term improvement to our internal control environment  we are also very mindful of the risks associated with the transitioning to these new systems  particularly while we are striving to become timely and current in our financial and sec periodic reporting 
it is likely the transition to our new north american financial reporting systems will not begin before the last half of our initiatives related to becoming timely in our financial and sec periodic reporting include shorten the financial closing process 
to achieve and sustain timely financial and sec periodic reporting  public companies with properly functioning internal controls prepare their financial statement accounts and balances the financial closing process on a monthly cycle within fifteen days of month s end 
since we first identified a significant number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in  we have conducted only a quarterly financial closing process 
the financial closing process for the first quarter of is not complete 
we will be transitioning to a monthly financial closing process when we begin the preparation of our financial statement accounts and balances for the third quarter of we are targeting achievement of a monthly financial closing process days after month s end  beginning with the first quarter of our ability to achieve this target on time will depend  in part  on becoming timely and maintaining only one open monthly cycle at a time  strengthening overall control processes to rely more on systems rather than manual processes  gaining experience with new underlying tools and processes  moving to a real time quarterly review process by our auditors  completing organizational build outs in certain areas  retaining an appropriate number of qualified finance personnel  particularly in our international locations  and full cooperation from our client engagement teams and other corporate services in timely providing financial information and updates into our financial closing process 
improve disclosure controls 
under the sec s reporting requirements  we must file our quarterly reports within forty days of the end of each fiscal quarter and our annual reports within sixty days of the end of each fiscal year 
we are very proud of the significant improvements made by our finance and legal teams in in the preparation  review and completion of the content of our sec periodic reports 
however  our disclosure controls process must be further streamlined and coordinated across the company for us to achieve timely filing of our sec periodic reports  given that our monthly financial closing process is targeted to be reduced to no less than days by early remediate material weaknesses 
we must remediate the material weaknesses in our financial reporting to remove the significant amounts of manual  time consuming steps that currently exist in our financial closing process to be able to consistently file our sec periodic reports on a timely basis 
resolving these material weaknesses is also crucial to being able to obtain timely and accurate standardized metrics with which to manage our business  increase cash collections and further reduce our dsos  assuming we can achieve our targets for shortening the financial closing process 
we were unsuccessful in our attempts to remediate all of our material weaknesses by the end of and can give no assurances as to how many material weaknesses we will be able to remediate by the end of we currently do not anticipate full remediation of all material weaknesses until  however  we must make significant progress in our remediation during  if we are to sustain timely financial and sec periodic reporting in replace our north american financial reporting systems 
we continue to prepare for the transformation of our north american financial reporting systems 
during  we spent approximately million related to the maintenance of our existing north american financial reporting systems and the preparation of our transition to new north american financial reporting systems  and we currently expect to incur an additional million and million in and  respectively  in these efforts 
we will be transitioning from our existing north american financial reporting systems to two industry standard applications 
for our public services business in north america  we plan to implement an industry standard platform for us government contract accounting 
we plan to implement the same financial system for our north american commercial operations that has worked successfully for our emea operations 
our planning and design phase is near complete 
we believe that our existing north american financial reporting systems are currently performing at an operating level that will allow us  in the short term  to prepare our financial statements and make our periodic filings with the sec on a timely basis  assuming we can achieve our targets for shortening the financial closing process and obtaining timely and accurate financial information and updates from our client engagement teams and other corporate services 
reduce employee attrition 
we are seeking to reduce attrition by raising our levels of employee ownership to align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders  providing improved training opportunities and seeking to better understand and manage employee career expectations 
psu program 
in february  the compensation committee approved the issuance of up to million psus to our managing directors and other high performing senior level employees  including its executive officers 
the psu awards  each of which initially represents the right to receive at the time of settlement one share of the company s common stock  will vest on december  generally  for any psu award to vest  two performance based metrics must be achieved for the performance period beginning on february  and ending on december  the company must first achieve a compounded average annual growth target in consolidated business unit contribution  and total shareholder return for shares of the company s common stock must be at least equal to the th percentile of total shareholder return of the standard poor s s p 
for information  see item  executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis 
depending on the company s total shareholder return relative to those companies that comprise the s p  the psu awards will vest on december  at percentages varying from to of the number of psu awards originally awarded  and will settle on various dates in and we have no plans to make additional equity awards on a broad basis to our existing employees through performance cash awards 
in february  the compensation committee also granted performance cash awards providing for the payment of up to million to a group of our managing directors and other high performing senior level employees  including executive officers 
generally  of these cash retention awards will be earned on december   and will be earned on december   subject to the company achieving the same compounded growth rate target in consolidated business unit contribution as required under the psu program for the relevant period of time 
if  however  the minimum compounded annual growth in consolidated business unit contribution has not been achieved at the end of each of those years  the awards may still be fully earned up to the full remaining available amount of the award if compounded average annual growth for the three year period ended december  is achieved 
amounts earned will be paid by march  or  if the determination of amounts earned cannot be made by march  within days of the date when the determination is made 
furthermore  we believe this cash award program provides retentive benefits for its participants  particularly when our equity based awards are illiquid  while further enhancing a pay for performance culture within the company 
enhance employee training 
to help our employees develop the skills they need to be successful with clients and advance their careers  we will further implement our training programs  including the joint training program with yale university 
in  our curriculum includes consulting skills workshops for both our new analysts as well as our more experienced consultants  a management skills workshop for top performing managers focused on our company s vision  direction  strategy and culture  and leadership workshops  both at the senior manager and new managing directors levels 
we expect that in  over  of our employees will participate in one of our programs at yale 
in  we will be developing a new high performing senior manager program focused on identifying and developing high performing employees  which will be supported by a new curriculum and new promotion processes 
this program will represent our investment in enhanced succession planning as well as our commitment to developing our next generation of leaders 
in  we are implementing two initiatives aimed at enhancing career development and performance management for our employees 
the bearingpoint core competencies provide career guidance to our employees by defining a roadmap for career development and progression  setting forth a standardized set of behaviors that can be used to assess performance within each career level and identify areas for development 
these core competencies are supplemented by our new career model  which sets forth three specialized career paths  applicable across our organization  for focused development and advancement for our staff 
the career model encourages our employees to actively consider their long term career goals within our organization  and to take actions that will help them achieve these goals

strengthen our balance sheet 
our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet include new credit facility 
our credit facility  consists of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million and a letter of credit facility in an aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not to exceed million 
the credit facility provides us with significantly greater financial resources than our credit facility did  and on terms that will allow us to focus on achieving and sustaining timely completion of our financial statements and filing of our sec periodic filing without artificially imposed  interim financial reporting deadlines such as those that were imposed under the credit facility 
for additional information regarding the credit facility  see liquidity and capital resources 
reduce our dsos and improve operating cash flow 
while we made significant strides in reducing dsos in  we have not yet achieved industry averages 
to achieve further meaningful reductions in dsos  we have focused on this metric at all leadership levels and are working to increase the functionality of  and training on  north american financial reporting systems to aid in the prompt generation of client invoices and account aging schedules 
at december   our dsos stood at days  which we believe to be significantly above the current dso average for information technology service companies 
improve internal cash management 
through may   we have repatriated approximately million from our international subsidiaries in in connection with this effort  we undertook a detailed review of our existing internal processes relating to cash management and have identified a series of steps that we can take to more efficiently utilize cash within our different geographic regions and more efficiently allocate firm wide costs among all of our geographic regions

latin america revenue increased in  primarily as a function of the weakening of the us dollar against local currencies in latin america particularly the brazilian real  along with local currency revenue growth and increasing engagement hours in brazil  offset by deteriorating revenue in mexico

investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities during increased million over this increase was predominantly due to the change in the amount of restricted cash posted as collateral for letters of credit and surety bonds 
the requirement to deposit and maintain cash collateral terminated as part of the march  amendment to the credit facility  and such cash collateral was released to us 
the increase was offset by an increase of million in capital expenditures in over net cash used in investing activities during was million  an increase of million over this increase was due to an increase in restricted cash of million for cash collateral posted in support of bank guarantees for letters of credit and surety bonds  which was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of million

in addition  issuances of common stock from our espp generated  million and million in cash during  and  respectively 
because we are not current in our sec periodic filings  we are unable to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock 
consequently  we were unable to make any public offerings of our common stock in or and have not issued shares under the ltip or espp since early these sources of financing will remain unavailable to us until we are again current in our sec periodic filings 
additional cash flow information at march   we had global cash balances of approximately million

borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes  including the payment of obligations outstanding under our prior credit facility  and payment of the fees and expenses of the credit facility 
for additional information regarding the credit facility  see credit facility 
our decision to obtain the credit facility was based  in part  on the fact that the north american cash balances have been negatively affected in the first quarter of by  among other things  cash collection levels not maintaining pace with the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of and payments made in connection with the uninsured portion of the settlement of the dispute with ht  ongoing costs relating to the design and implementation of the new north american financial reporting systems  ongoing costs relating to production and completion of our financial statements  other additional accrued expenses for paid in the first quarter of  and our current expectations that operations will not generate cash before the latter part of outlook 
we currently expect that our operations will continue to use  rather than provide a source of cash through the latter part of based on current internal estimates  we nonetheless believe that our cash balances  together with cash generated from operations and borrowings made under our credit facility  will be sufficient to provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth and operating needs 
our management may seek alternative strategies  intended to further improve our cash balances and their accessibility  if current internal estimates for cash uses for prove incorrect 
these activities include initiating further cost reduction efforts  seeking improvements in working capital management  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  seeking additional debt or equity capital and selling assets 
after consultation with a number of our external financial advisors and various credit sources  we continue to believe that our available receivables and expected earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization are  notwithstanding our not being current in our sec periodic filings  sufficient to provide us with access to the private equity and debt placement markets 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to issue equity or debt with acceptable terms and the proceeds from any such issuances  subject to certain exceptions  must first be used to repay amounts owed under our credit facility 
based on the foregoing and our current state of knowledge of the outlook for our business  we currently believe that cash provided from operations  existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the end of however  actual results may differ from current expectations for many reasons  including losses of business that could result from our continuing failure to timely file periodic reports with the sec  the occurrence of any event of default that could provide our lenders with a right of acceleration eg  non payment  possible delisting from the nyse  further downgrades of our credit ratings or unexpected demands on our current cash resources eg  to settle lawsuits 
for additional information regarding various risk factors that could affect our outlook  see item a  risk factors 
if cash provided from operations is insufficient and or our ability to access the capital markets is impeded  our business  operations  results and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected

the credit facility requires us to make prepayments of outstanding term loans and cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to i of the net proceeds received from property or asset sales subject to exceptions  ii of the net proceeds received from the issuance or incurrence of additional debt subject to exceptions  iii of all casualty and condemnation proceeds subject to exceptions  iv of the net proceeds received from the issuance of equity subject to exceptions and v for each fiscal year ending on or after december  and  at our election for the second half of the fiscal year  the difference between a of the excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility and b any voluntary prepayment of the term loan or the lc facility as defined in the credit facility subject to exceptions 
if the term loan is prepaid or the lc facility is reduced prior to may  with other indebtedness or another letter of credit facility  we may be required to pay a prepayment premium of of the principal amount of the term loan so prepaid or lc facility so reduced if the cost of such replacement indebtedness of letter of credit facility is lower than the cost of the credit facility 
in addition  we are required to pay  in principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest at the end of each quarter  commencing on june  and ending on march  the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants the affirmative covenants include  among other things the delivery of unaudited quarterly and audited annual financial statements  all in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  certain monthly operating metrics and budgets  compliance with applicable laws and regulations excluding  prior to october   compliance with certain filing requirements under the securities laws  maintenance of existence and insurance  after october   as requested by the administrative agent  maintenance of credit ratings  and maintenance of books and records subject to the material weaknesses previously disclosed in our form k 
the negative covenants  which subject to exceptions restrict certain of our corporate activities  include  among other things  limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and acquisitions  payment of dividends  stock repurchases and redemptions  incurrence of additional indebtedness  making of loans and investments  creation of liens  prepayment of other indebtedness  and engaging in certain transactions with affiliates 
events of default under the credit facility include  among other things defaults based on nonpayment  breach of representations  warranties and covenants  cross defaults to other debt above million  loss of lien on collateral  invalidity of certain guarantees  certain bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain erisa events  judgments against us in an aggregate amount in excess of million  and change of control events 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are not required to become current in our sec periodic filings until october  until october   our failure to provide annual audited or quarterly unaudited financial statements  to keep our books and records in accordance with gaap or to timely file our sec periodic reports will not be considered an event of default under the credit facility 
the timing of the requirement that we become current in our sec periodic filings is aligned with the timing set forth in the waivers obtained under certain of our indentures 
as previously disclosed  the indenture governing the series a debentures and series b debentures was amended to include a waiver of our sec reporting requirements under the indenture through october  in addition  the indenture governing the april debentures was amended to include a waiver of our sec reporting requirements under such indenture through october   or through october  if we elect to pay an additional fee to certain holders of such debentures 
discontinued credit facility on july   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility the credit facility 
our credit facility provided for up to million in revolving credit and advances 
advances under the revolving credit line were limited by the available borrowing base  which was based upon a percentage of eligible accounts receivable 
as of december   we had approximately million available under the borrowing base 
in and  we entered into five amendments to the credit facility 
among other things  these amendments revised certain covenants contained in the credit facility  including the extensions of the filing deadlines for our  and sec periodic reports and an increase in the amounts of civil litigation payments that we are permitted to pay and in the aggregate amount of investments and indebtedness that we are permitted to make and incur with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  in we obtained several limited waivers that  among other things  waived the delivery requirement of our periodic filings to the lenders under the facility 
the credit facility was terminated on may  on that date  all outstanding obligations under the credit facility were paid or assumed under the credit facility  and all liens and security interests under the credit facility were released 
guarantees and indemnification obligations in the normal course of business  we have indemnified third parties and have commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in certain circumstances 
these indemnities  commitments and guarantees include indemnities to third parties in connection with surety bonds  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases  indemnities to customers related to intellectual property and performance of services subcontracted to other providers  and indemnities to directors and officers under the organizational documents and agreements with them 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
certain of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we estimate that the fair value of these agreements was minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of december  information regarding the amounts of our outstanding surety and surety related bonds and letters of credit can be found above 
we are also required  in the course of business  particularly with certain of our public services clients  largely in the state and local markets  to obtain surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees for client engagements 
at december   we had million in outstanding surety bonds and million in letters of credit extended to secure certain of these bonds 
the issuers of our outstanding surety bonds may  at any time  require that we post collateral cash or letters of credit to fully secure these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management s estimates  assumptions and judgments are derived and continually evaluated based on available information  historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the north american financial reporting systems  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived assets  accounting for leases  restructuring charges  legal contingencies  retirement benefits  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for intercompany loans 
a critical accounting policy is one that involves making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  services to provide general business consulting  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  business valuations and corporate strategy services and managed services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials  cost plus or fixed price 
technology integration services represent a significant portion of our business and are generally accounted for under the percentage of completion method in accordance with the statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon costs to the client incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs to the client 
when total cost estimates exceed estimated revenue  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and anticipated changes in estimated salaries and other costs 
incentives and award payments are included in estimated revenue using the percentage of completion method when the realization of such amounts is deemed probable upon achievement of certain defined goals 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and costs are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
revenue for general business consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverable  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
for our managed service arrangements  we typically implement or build system applications for customers that we then manage or run for periods that may span several years 
such arrangements include the delivery of a combination of one or more of our service offerings and are governed by emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in managed service arrangements in which the system application implementation or build has standalone value to the customer  and we have evidence of fair value for the managed or run services  we bifurcate the total arrangement into two units of accounting i the system application implementation or build  which is recognized as technology integration services using the percentage of completion method under sop  and ii the managed or run services  which are recognized under sab ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
in instances where we are unable to bifurcate a managed service arrangement into separate units of accounting  the total contract is recognized as one unit of accounting under sab in such instances  total fees and costs related to the system application implementation or build are deferred and recognized together with managed or run services upon completion of the software application implementation or build ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
certain managed service arrangements may also include transaction based services in addition to the system application implementation or build and managed services 
fees from transaction based services are recognized as earned if we have evidence of fair value for such transactions  otherwise  transaction fees are spread ratably over the remaining life of the customer relationship period as received 
the determination of fair value requires us to use significant judgment 
we determine the fair value of service revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately and or prevailing market rates for similar services 
revenue includes reimbursements of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in other direct contract expenses 
in addition  we generally enter into relationships with subcontractors where we maintain a principal relationship with the customer 
in such instances  subcontractor costs are included in revenue with offsetting expenses recorded in other direct contract expenses 
unbilled revenue consists of recognized recoverable costs and accrued profits on contracts for which billings had not been presented to clients as of the balance sheet date 
management anticipates that the collection of these amounts will occur within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized for which payments have been received are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
valuation of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
assessing the collectibility of customer receivables requires management judgment 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by specifically analyzing individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic and accounts receivable aging trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
our valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
valuation of goodwill goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair value of net identifiable assets on the date of purchase 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis on april and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  as prescribed in the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
an impairment review of the carrying amount of goodwill is conducted if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historically or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  the more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold  significant adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or a significant unforeseen decline in our credit rating 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as of december   our reporting units consisted of our three north america industry groups and our three international regions 
to identify impairment  the fair value of the reporting unit is first compared with its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s allocated carrying value exceeds its fair value  we undertake a second evaluation to assess the required impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount for which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the discounted cash flow valuation model and comparable market transaction models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit as well as comparability with recent transactions in the industry 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
determining the fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
accounting for income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for income tax when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are probable to be challenged and possibly disallowed by various authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest as deemed appropriate 
to the extent that the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
the majority of our deferred tax assets at december  consisted of federal  foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during  the valuation allowance against federal  state  and certain foreign net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards increased million over the year ended  due to additional losses 
since our inception  various foreign  state and local authorities have audited us in the area of income taxes 
those audits included examining the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with foreign  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue charges for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
during  the internal revenue service commenced a federal income tax examination for the tax periods ended june   june   december   december  and december  we are unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these examinations  but we believe that we have established appropriate reserves related to apportionment of income between jurisdictions  the impact of the restatement items and certain filing positions 
we are also under examination from time to time in foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
at december   we believe we have appropriately accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
during  and  none of the established reserves expired based on the statute of limitations with respect to certain tax examination periods 
in addition  an increase to the reserve for tax exposures of million  million  and million  respectively  was recorded as an income tax expense for additional exposures  including interest and penalties 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the value of the deferred tax assets is not realizable 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation allowance 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that a significant amount of our deferred tax assets primarily in the us may not be realized  therefore we recorded a valuation allowance against those deferred assets 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives purchased software  internal capitalized software  and customer lists 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
accounting for leases we lease office facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through  along with options that permit renewals for additional periods 
rent abatements and escalations are considered in the determination of straight line rent expense for operating leases 
leasehold improvements made at the inception of or during the lease are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the lease term 
we receive incentives to lease office facilities in certain areas which are recorded as a deferred credit and recognized as a reduction to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
restructuring charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidation and or relocation of operations  changes in our strategic plan or management responses to increasing costs or declines in demand 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management to utilize significant judgment and estimates related to expenses for employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of lease and facilities restructuring charges  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet excess facilities and sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on available information and known market conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to make changes in these estimates that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
retirement benefits our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
and sfas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the pension plans relate to our plans for employees in germany and switzerland 
accounting for retirement plans requires management to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
for  the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation for the pension plans was 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension expense for the plans by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension expense for the plans by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on assets for the was 
this rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for the defined benefit plan weighted by the plans assets as of december  to develop this assumption  we considered historical asset returns  the current asset allocation and future expectations of asset returns 
the actual long term rate of return from july  until december  was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a million impact on our pension expense 
as of december   the pension plan had an million unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
we also offer a postretirement medical plan to the majority of our full time us employees and managing directors who meet specific eligibility requirements 
for  the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the benefits could be effectively settled 
the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields with maturities consistent with expected retiree medical payment periods 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have approximately a million impact on the retiree medical expense for the plan 
as of december   the pension plan had million in unrecognized actuarial losses that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
accounting for stock based compensation we have various stock based compensation plans under which we have granted stock options  restricted stock awards and stock units to certain officers  employees and non employee directors 
we also have the espp and be an owner plans that allow for employees to purchase company stock at a discount 
we granted both service based and performance based stock units and stock options during for all awards  the fair value is fixed on the date of grant based on the number of stock units or stock options issued and the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
for the performance based stock units and stock options  each quarter we compare the actual performance results with the performance conditions to determine the probability of the award fully vesting 
the determination of successful compliance with the performance conditions requires significant judgment by management  as differing outcomes may have a significant impact on current and future stock compensation expense 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r on january  this standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
we have used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r  the compensation expense that we record in the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas r and consequently have not adjusted results from prior years 
under the modified prospective transition method  the compensation cost includes expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december  along with new grants made during for grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria  the grant date fair value of the shares is recognized over the requisite period of performance once achievement of criteria is deemed probable 
for grants that vest through the passage of time  the grant date fair value of the award is recognized over the vesting period 
we elected the alternative transition method as outlined in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r  to calculate the historical pool of excess tax benefits available to offset tax shortfalls in periods following the adoption of sfas r 
the after tax stock based compensation expense impact of adopting sfas r for the year ended december  was million with a per share reduction to diluted earnings per share 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  including financial interpretation fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  for our plans 
under this accounting method  stock option compensation awards that are granted with an exercise price at the current fair value of our common stock as of the date of the award generally did not require compensation expense to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense recognized for our employee stock option plans  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards was million in  net of tax 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows unrecognized compensation weighted average costs life in years stock options restricted stock and stock unit awards espp total accounting for intercompany loans intercompany loans are classified between long and short term based on management s intent regarding repayment 
translation gains and losses on short term loans are recorded in other income expense  net  in our consolidated financial statements and similar gains and losses on long term loans are recorded as other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity deficit 
accordingly  changes in management s intent relative to the expected repayment of these intercompany loans will change the amount of translation gains and losses included in our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for employee global mobility and tax equalization we have a tax equalization policy designed to ensure that our employees on domestic long term and foreign assignments will be subject to the same level of personal tax  regardless of the tax jurisdiction in which the employee works 
we accrue for tax equalization expenses in the period incurred 
if the estimated tax equalization liability  including related interest and penalties  is determined to be greater or less than amounts due upon final settlement  the difference is recorded in the current period

in september  the sec staff issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both the rollover method  which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement and is the method we currently use  and the iron curtain method  which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet 
the use of both of these methods is referred to as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with sab no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks  which include interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk  arise in the normal course of business rather than from trading activities 
interest rate risk our exposure to potential losses due to changes in interest rates is minimal as our outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates 
the fair value of our debt obligations may increase or decrease for various reasons  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions

assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
we have foreign exchange exposures related primarily to short term intercompany loans denominated in non us dollars to certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the potential gain or loss in the fair value of these intercompany loans that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
