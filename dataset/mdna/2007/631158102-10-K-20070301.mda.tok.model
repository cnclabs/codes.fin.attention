item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
competition food distribution segment competition is intense among the distributors in the food distribution segment as evidenced by the low margin nature of the business 
success in this segment is measured by the ability to leverage scale in order to gain pricing advantages and operating efficiencies  to provide superior merchandising programs and services to the independent customer base and to use technology to increase distribution efficiencies 
we compete with local  regional and national food distributors  as well as with vertically integrated national and regional chains using a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs that purchase directly from suppliers and self distribute products to their stores 
we face competition from these companies on the basis of price  quality  variety and availability of products  strength of private label brands  schedules and reliability of deliveries  and the range and quality of customer services 
continuing our quality service by focusing on key metrics such as our on time delivery rate  fill rate  and customer satisfaction is essential in maintaining our competitive advantage 
we believe we are an industry leader in on time delivery rate and fill rate for fiscal in fiscal we will be substituting customer satisfaction for selector accuracy as one of our key metrics 

table of contents military segment we are one of seven distributors with annual sales to the deca commissary system in excess of million 
we estimate that over of deca s purchases from distributors via the frequent delivery system are made through these seven distributors 
the remaining distributors that supply deca tend to be smaller  regional and local providers 
in addition  manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products  such as baking supplies  produce  deli items  soft drinks and snack items  directly to deca commissaries and service exchanges 
because of the narrow margins in this industry  it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale  which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic market s a distributor serves  and the distributor s share of that market 
as a result  no distributor in this industry has a nationwide presence 
rather  distributors tend to concentrate on specific regions  or areas within specific regions  where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently 
in addition  distributors that operate larger civilian distribution businesses tend to compete for deca commissary business in areas where such business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing civilian distribution centers 
we believe the principal competitive factors among distributors within this industry are customer service  price  operating efficiencies  reputation with deca and location of distribution centers 
we believe our competitive position is very strong with respect to all these factors within the geographic areas where we compete 
retail segment competition in the retail grocery business in our geographic markets is intense 
we compete with many organizations of various sizes  ranging from national and regional chains that operate a variety of formats such as supercenters  supermarkets  extreme value food stores and membership warehouse club stores to local grocery store chains and privately owned unaffiliated grocery stores 
although our target geographic areas have a relatively low presence of national and multi regional grocery store chains  we are facing increasing competitive pressure from the expansion of supercenters  primarily those operated by wal mart stores  inc  and regional chains 
during and  there were and  respectively  of our stores impacted by the opening of new supercenters in their markets and a total of stores as of december  had sales impacted by supercenters 
depending upon the market  we compete based on price  quality and assortment  store appeal  including store location and format  sales promotions  advertising  service and convenience 
we believe our ability to provide convenience  outstanding perishable execution and exceptional customer service are particularly important factors in achieving competitive success 
vendor allowances and credits we participate with our vendors in a broad menu of promotions to increase sales of products 
these promotions fall into two main categories  off invoice allowances and performance based allowances  and are often subject to negotiation with our vendors 
in the case of off invoice allowances  discounts are typically offered by vendors with respect to certain merchandise purchased by us during a specified period of time 
we use off invoice allowances to support a variety of marketing programs such as reduced price offerings for specific time periods  food shows  pallet promotions and private label promotions 
the discounts are either reflected directly on the vendor invoice  as a reduction from the normal wholesale prices for merchandise to which the allowance applies  or we are allowed to deduct the allowance as an offset against the vendor s invoice when it is paid 
in the case of performance based allowances  the allowance or rebate is based on our completion of some specific activity  such as purchasing or selling product during a certain time period 
this basic performance requirement may be accompanied by an additional performance requirement such as providing advertising or special in store promotion  tracking specific shipments of goods to retailers  or to customers in the case of our own retail stores  during a specified period retail performance allowances  slotting adding a new item to the system in one or more of our distribution centers and merchandising a new item  or achieving certain minimum purchase quantities 
the billing for these performance based allowances is normally in the form of a bill back in which case we are invoiced at the regular price with the understanding that we may bill back the vendor for the requisite allowance when the performance is satisfied 
we also assess an administrative fee  
table of contents reflected on the invoices sent to vendors  to recoup our reasonable costs of performing the tasks associated with administering retail performance allowances 
we collectively plan promotions with our vendors and arrive at the amount the respective vendor plans to spend on promotions with us 
each vendor has its own method for determining the amount of promotional funds budgeted to be spent with us during the period 
in most situations  the vendor allowances are based on units we purchased from the vendor 
in other situations  the allowances are based on our past or anticipated purchases and or the anticipated performance of the planned promotions 
forecasting promotional expenditures is a critical part of our frequently scheduled planning sessions with our vendors 
as individual promotions are completed and the associated billing is processed  the vendors track our promotional program execution and spend rate  and discuss the tracking  performance and spend rate with us on a regular basis throughout the year  which may be weekly  monthly  quarterly or annually 
these communications include future promotions  product cost  targeted retails and price points  anticipated volume  promotion expenditures  vendor maintenance  billing issues and procedures  new items discontinued items  and trade spend levels relative to budget per event and per year  as well as the resolution of any issues that arise between the vendor and us 
in the future  the nature and menu of promotional programs and the allocation of dollars among them may change as a result of ongoing negotiations and commercial relationships between vendors and us 
trademarks and servicemarks we own or license a number of trademarks  trade names and servicemarks that relate to our products and services  including those mentioned in this report 
we consider certain of these trademarks  trade names and servicemarks  such as our family and value choice  to be of material value to the business conducted by our food distribution and retail segments  and we actively defend and enforce such trademarks  trade names and servicemarks 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom  were employed on a full time basis and  employed on a part time basis 
of our total number of employees  are represented by unions of all employees and consist primarily of warehouse personnel and drivers in our ohio  indiana and michigan distribution centers 
we consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  you should carefully consider the specific risk factors set forth below in evaluating nash finch because any of the following risks could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
the risks described below are not the 
table of contents only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also materially and adversely affect us 
we face substantial competition and our competitors may have superior resources  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
the food distribution and retail businesses are intensely competitive  characterized by high inventory turnover  narrow profit margins and increasing consolidation 
our food distribution business competes not only with local  regional and national food distributors  but also with vertically integrated national and regional chains that employ a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
our retail business  focused in the upper midwest  has historically competed with traditional grocery stores and is increasingly competing with alternative store formats such as supercenters primarily those operated by wal mart  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and extreme value food stores 
the military food distribution business is also highly competitive 
because of the narrow margins in the military food distribution industry  it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale  which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases in the geographic markets a distributor serves and a distributor s share of that market 
as a result  no distributor in this industry has a nationwide presence and it is very difficult  other than through acquisitions  to expand operations in this industry beyond the geographic regions where we currently can utilize our warehouse and distribution capacity 
we face competition in our military business from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller food distributors 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial resources and geographic scope  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do  intensifying price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats  which have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of traditional grocery stores  tend to produce even stronger competition for our food retail business and for the independent customers of our distribution business 
to the extent our independent customers are acquired by our competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non traditional competitors  sales by our distribution business will also be affected 
if we fail to effectively implement strategies to respond to these competitive pressures  our operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions  decreased sales or margins  or loss of market share 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to improve the competitive position of our retail operations 
our retail food business faces extreme competition from regional and national chains operating under a variety of formats that devote square footage to selling food ie  supercenters  supermarkets  extreme value stores  membership warehouse clubs  dollar stores  drug stores  convenience stores  various formats selling prepared foods  and other specialty and discount retailers  as well as from independent food store operators in the markets where we have retail operations 
during fiscal we announced new strategic initiatives designed to provide steps to creating value within our organization 
these steps include designing and reformatting our base of retail stores into alternative formats to increase overall retail sales performance 
in connection with these efforts  there are numerous risks and uncertainties  including our ability to successfully identify which course of action will be most financially advantageous for each retail store  our ability to identify those initiatives that will be the most effective in improving the competitive position of the retail stores we retain  our ability to efficiently and timely implement these initiatives  and the response of competitors to these initiatives 
if we are unable to improve the overall competitive position of our remaining retail stores the operating performance of that segment may continue to decline and we may need to recognize additional impairments of our long lived assets and goodwill  be compelled to close or dispose of additional stores and may incur restructuring or other charges to our earnings associated with such closure and disposition activities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace any of the revenue lost from these closed or sold stores from our other operations 

table of contents our ability to operate effectively could be impaired by the risks and costs associated with the efforts to grow our business through acquisitions 
efforts to grow our food distribution segment may include acquisitions 
acquisitions entail various risks such as identifying suitable candidates  effecting acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  obtaining adequate financing and acceptable terms and conditions 
our success depends in a large part on factors such as our ability to successfully integrate such operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and retain the customer base of the acquired operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate these operations and retain the customer base  we may experience material adverse consequences to our results of operations and financial condition 
the integration of separately managed businesses operating in different markets involves a number of risks  including the following demands on management related to the significant increase in our size after the acquisition of operations  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices  such as those involving vendor promotions  and of geographically dispersed personnel and operations  difficulties in the integration of departments  information technology systems  operating methods  technologies  books and records and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls  including internal accounting controls  procedures and policies  and expenses of any undisclosed liabilities  such as those involving environmental or legal matters 
successful integration of new operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations  fully assimilate the operations into our distribution network  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  maintain the customer base and eliminate redundant and excess costs 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits or savings from an acquisition to the extent or in the time frame anticipated  if at all  or such benefits and savings may include higher costs than anticipated 
substantial operating losses may occur if the customers to whom we extend credit or for whom we guarantee loan or lease obligations fail to repay us 
in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit  including loans  to our food distribution customers  and provide financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations 
we also lease store sites for sublease to independent retailers 
generally  our loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrated and may have limited access to conventional financing 
as of december  we had loans  net of reserves of million outstanding to of our food distribution customers and had guaranteed outstanding debt and lease obligations of food distribution customers totaling million  including million in loan guarantees to one retailer 
in the normal course of business  we also sublease retail properties and assign retail property leases to third parties 
as of december   the present value of our maximum contingent liability exposure  net of reserves  with respect to subleases and assigned leases was million and million  respectively 
while we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend  such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure 
greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions  loans  guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements  which could result from factors such as business difficulties experienced by customers with the highest concentration of credit exposure or in times of general economic difficulty or uncertainty  could negatively and potentially materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
consumable goods distribution is sensitive to economic conditions and economic downturns or uncertainty may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the food distribution and retail industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  particularly those that influence consumer confidence  spending and buying habits 
economic downturns or uncertainty may not only adversely affect overall demand and intensify price competition  but also cause 
table of contents consumers to trade down by purchasing lower priced  and often lower margin  items and to make fewer purchases in traditional supermarket channels 
these consumer responses  coupled with the impact of general economic and other factors such as increasingly volatile energy costs  food safety  prevailing interest rates  food price inflation or deflation  employment trends in our markets  and labor and energy costs  can also have a significant impact on our operating results 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
we may experience technology failures which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have large  complex information technology systems that are important to our business operations 
although we have an off site disaster recovery center and have installed security programs and procedures  security could be compromised and technology failures and systems disruptions could occur 
this could result in a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant costs  including payments to third parties for damages 
our distribution business could be negatively affected if we fail to retain existing customers or attract significant numbers of new customers 
increasing the growth and profitability of our distribution business is dependent in large measure upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional distribution customers through our existing network of distribution centers  enabling us to more effectively utilize the fixed assets in that business 
our ability to achieve these goals is dependent  in part  upon our ability to continue to provide a high level of customer service  offer competitive products at low prices  maintain high levels of productivity and efficiency  particularly in the process of integrating new customers into our distribution system  and offer marketing  merchandising and ancillary services that provide value to our independent customers 
if we are unable to execute these tasks effectively  we may not be able to attract significant numbers of new customers and attrition among our existing customer base could increase  either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
changes in vendor promotions or allowances  including the way vendors target their promotional spending  and our ability to effectively manage these programs could significantly impact our margins and profitability 
we engage in a wide variety of promotional programs cooperatively with our vendors 
the nature of these programs and the allocation of dollars among them evolve over time as the parties assess the results of specific promotions and plan for future promotions 
these programs require careful management in order for us to maintain or improve margins while at the same time driving sales for us and for the vendors 
a reduction in overall promotional spending or a shift in promotional spending away from certain types of promotions that we have historically utilized could have a significant impact on our gross profit margin and profitability 
our ability to anticipate and react to changes in promotional spending by  among other things  planning and implementing alternative programs that are expected to be mutually beneficial to the manufacturers and us  will be an important factor in maintaining or improving margins and profitability 
if we are unable to effectively manage these programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments include financial and other covenants that limit our operating flexibility and that may affect our future business strategies and operating results 
covenants in the documents governing our outstanding or future debt  including our senior secured credit facility  or our future debt levels  could limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our ability to respond to market conditions and opportunities as well as capital needs could be constrained by the degree to which we are leveraged  by changes in the availability or cost of capital  and by contractual limitations on the degree to which we may  without the consent of our lenders  take actions such as engaging in mergers  acquisitions or divestitures  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures and making investments  loans or advances 
if needs or opportunities were identified that would require financial resources beyond existing resources  
table of contents obtaining those resources could increase our borrowing costs  further reduce financial flexibility  require alterations in strategies and affect future operating results 
our military segment operations are dependant upon domestic and international military distribution  and a change in the military commissary system could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
because our military segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the us and overseas  any material changes in the commissary system  in military staffing levels or in locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment 
these changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system  relocation or consolidation in the number of commissaries and exchanges  base closings  troop redeployments or consolidations in the geographic areas containing commissaries and exchanges served by us  or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries and exchanges 
we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from the implementation of new strategic initiatives 
we have begun taking action to improve our competitive performance through a series of strategic initiatives 
the goal of this effort is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy  addressing the food distribution industry environment and our position within the industry and ultimately create increased shareholder value 
we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives and realize the intended synergies  business opportunities and growth prospects 
many of the risk factors previously mentioned  such as increased competition  may limit our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and expand our business 
our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities may not bring the intended result 
assumptions underlying estimates of expected revenue growth or overall cost savings may not be met or economic conditions may deteriorate 
customer acceptance of new retail formats developed may not be as anticipated  hampering our ability to attract new retail customers or maintain our existing retail customer base 
additionally  our management may have its attention diverted from other important activities while trying to execute new strategic initiatives 
if these or other factors limit our ability to execute our strategic initiatives  our expectations of future results of operations  including expected revenue growth and cost savings  may not be met 
the foregoing discussion of risk factors is not exhaustive  and we do not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made

item legal proceedings shareholder litigation on december  and january   two purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the united states district court for the district of minnesota on behalf of purchasers of nash finch common stock during the period from february   the date we announced an agreement to acquire two distribution divisions from roundy s  through october   the date we announced a downward revision to our earnings outlook for fiscal one of the complaints was voluntarily dismissed on march  and a consolidated complaint was filed on june  the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants violated the securities exchange act of by issuing false statements regarding  among other things  the integration of the distribution divisions acquired from roundy s  the performance of our core businesses  our internal controls and our financial projections  so as to artificially inflate the price of our common stock 
the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint  which the court has taken under advisement 
we intend to vigorously defend against the consolidated complaint 
no damages have been specified 
we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of prevailing in this case at this early stage of the proceedings  but do not believe the eventual outcome will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

we offered to provide certain documents  and the sec accepted the offer 
we will continue to fully cooperate with the sec

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distribution company in the united states 
our business consists of three primary operating segments food distribution  military and food retailing 
in november we announced the launch of a new strategic plan  operation fresh start  designed to sharpen our focus and provide a strong platform to support growth initiatives

in addition  we may from time to time identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities in our food distribution and military segments  and to the extent we believe such opportunities present strategic benefits to those segments and can be achieved in a cost effective manner  complete such acquisitions 
our food distribution segment sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label products to independent grocery stores and other customers primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
on march  we completed the purchase from roundy s of the net assets  including customer contracts  of two roundy s wholesale food distribution divisions and two retail stores 
we believe the acquisition of these two divisions provides a valuable strategic opportunity for us to further leverage our existing relationships in the regions in which these divisions operate and to grow our food distribution business in a cost effective manner 
the costs of integrating these divisions had a temporary impact on margins  but have positioned us to benefit from the synergies inherent in this acquisition 
our military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges located primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and in europe  cuba  puerto rico  egypt and the azores 
we are the largest distributor of grocery products to us military commissaries and exchanges  with over years of experience acting as a distributor to us military commissaries and exchanges 
our retail segment operated corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest as of december  primarily due to intensely competitive conditions in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious customers  same store sales in our retail business have declined since  although the declines have moderated in more recent periods 
as a result  we closed or sold retail stores of which were a part of the special charge in  nine retail stores in and retail stores in we are taking and expect to take further initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view 
table of contents toward improving our response to and performance under these difficult competitive conditions 
our strategic initiatives are designed to provide steps to creating value within our organization 
these steps include designing and reformatting our base of retail stores into alternative formats to increase overall retail sales performance 
as we continue to assess the impact of performance improvement initiatives and the operating results of individual stores  we may need to recognize additional impairments of long lived assets and additional goodwill impairment associated with our retail segment  and may incur restructuring or other charges in connection with closure or sales activities 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal sales the following tables summarize our sales activity for fiscal  and percent percent percent percent percent segment sales sales of sales change sales of sales change sales of sales in millions food distribution military retail total sales the increase in fiscal food distribution sales versus the same period in was due to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions in the second quarter  adding an estimated million in sales to fiscal as compared to fiscal apart from the impact of the acquisition  sales declined in fiscal due to slower growth in new accounts and customer attrition 
in addition  sales to our existing customer base have also declined relative to the increase in food distribution sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  which added million in sales  the majority of the total increase in sales over fiscal excluding the impact of the acquisition  food distribution sales increased over fiscal  primarily related to new accounts 
military segment sales were up in fiscal as compared to fiscal the sales increase reflects increased product line offerings that have resulted in new sales volumes domestically 
the increase in military segment sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely due to increases in domestic commissary customer traffic 
domestic and overseas sales represented the following percentages of military segment sales domestic overseas 
table of contents the decrease in retail sales for fiscal is attributable to the closure or sale of stores during fiscal and nine stores during fiscal store closures accounted for million of the million drop in retail sales and a decline in same store sales 
same store sales  which compare retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative periods  decreased for as compared to the decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the closure or sale of stores in and nine stores in and a decline in same store sales of  partially offset by the addition of two stores as part of the roundy s acquisition 
these declines continue to reflect a difficult competitive environment in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious consumers 
during fiscal and  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year gross profit gross profit for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales gross profit margin during the period was partially due to a higher percentage of sales in the food distribution and military segments as opposed to the retail segment  which historically has a higher gross profit margin 
the decline in gross profit attributable to this shift in revenues was approximately of sales in and of sales in in addition  growth in our food distribution business has largely come from lower margin customers 
we estimate that this shift in customer mix toward lower margin food distribution customers decreased our overall gross profit margins by and in and  respectively 
included in cost of sales are inventory markdown and wind down costs related to retail store closings of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the markdown and wind down costs include costs of million associated with stores referred to in the special charges narrative below 
selling  general and administrative expense the following outlines selling  general and administrative expenses sg a and the significant factors affecting sg a of of of sales sales sales in millions except percentages sg a significant factors affecting sg a retail store impairments and lease costs on closed stores charges related to food distribution customers severance costs tradename impairment vacation standardization total significant factors affecting sg a sg a for fiscal was of sales as compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal a portion of the change in sg a as a percentage of sales in the period is reflected 
table of contents by the fact that our retail segment  which has higher sg a than our food distribution and military segments as a percentage of sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales in each of these periods 
the decrease in sg a attributable to this shift in revenues was approximately of sales in and of sales in impairment charges and lease closure costs for retail stores that were either closed or whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores respective market area were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal sg a included million of significant charges related to food distribution customers 
a second quarter charge of million reflected the impairment of certain retail properties and additional bad debt expense as a result of a customer s bankruptcy 
charges of million in the third and fourth quarter were necessary to increase lease reserves and bad debt provisions due to customers deteriorating financial condition 
other significant charges in fiscal sg a included million in executive severance costs  million reflecting the impairment of the fame tradename which was deemed to have no future value and million to standardize vacation policies at various locations and ensure our vacation policy was competitive in the marketplace 
gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the gain on sale of real estate in all years was primarily related to the sale of unoccupied properties 
special charges as previously discussed  we closed retail stores at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and sought purchasers for our denver area avanza retail stores 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a special charge of million which is reflected in the special charges line within the consolidated statements of income  and million of costs reflected in operating earnings  primarily involving inventory markdowns related to the retail store closures 
the special charge included million of impairment charges on long lived assets  million related to lease closure costs and million in other closure costs 
during fiscal  we decided to continue to operate the avanza retail stores and therefore recorded a reversal of million of the special charge related to these stores because the assets of the stores were revalued at historical cost less depreciation during the time held for sale 
partially offsetting this reversal was a million change in estimate for other property closure costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million of additional charges  million to write off capitalized lease assets and million to change estimates of lease commitments  related to three properties included in the special charge 
goodwill impairment during fiscal  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter based on conditions as of the end of our third fiscal quarter in in accordance with sfas the test  using an undiscounted operating cash flow assumption  indicated an impairment of our retail segment goodwill 
the resulting analysis of the discounted cash flows of the retail segment indicated an impairment necessitating a charge of million to retail goodwill 
no impairment was indicated or recorded in fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal decreased by million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation expense for software  fixtures and equipment and vehicles and reduced depreciation as a result of store closings offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to the purchase of the lima and westville divisions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased depreciation 
table of contents and amortization expense related to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  including the amortization of a million customer contract intangible  partially offset by the closure or sale of retail stores during fiscal and fiscal interest expense interest expense increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was largely due to an increase in our effective interest rate from for fiscal to for fiscal caused by rising interest rates on variable rate debt offset somewhat by the impact of interest rate swaps 
fiscal interest expense also included the payment of a million fee to amend covenants on our senior secured credit facility 
average borrowing levels decreased slightly from million for fiscal to million for fiscal interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the effective interest rate from for fiscal to for fiscal caused by changes in the composition of our debt as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below and the impact of interest rate swaps 
the effect of the decrease in our effective rate was partially offset by an increase in the average borrowing levels from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and by the payment of a million bridge loan fee during the second quarter of in connection with arrangement of our financing for the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for income from continuing operations in fiscal was compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by non deductible goodwill charges  which are added back to the pre tax loss from continuing operations to arrive at taxable income 
in fiscal  we increased tax reserves by million 
during fiscal years and  we reversed previously established income tax reserves of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the resolution of various federal and state tax issues and statute expirations 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates 
discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal and was a result of the resolution of a contingency associated with the sale of our nash de camp produce growing and marketing subsidiary in fiscal net earnings net earnings for fiscal were a loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal  and million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net earnings in each of the three years were affected by a number of events included in the discussion above that affected the comparability of results

we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for fiscal  and and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating cash flows were million for fiscal  an increase of million from million for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared to fiscal was a decrease of million in inventories during fiscal as compared to an increase of million in inventories in fiscal the decrease in fiscal inventories was due to progress made in our distribution business rationalization and integration of the lima and westville distribution centers acquired from roundy s  decreased retail inventories as a result of the sale or closure of stores in fiscal and increased focus on managing inventory levels 
operating cash flows were million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million from fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal as compared to fiscal was an increase of million in inventories primarily due to new military business and the integration of the westville and lima divisions 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal primarily used for additions of property  plant and equipment 
cash used for investing activities increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily because of the million used for the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal as million was used to pay down the revolving debt and other long term debt 
financing activities for fiscal primarily included proceeds from the private placement of million in convertible notes and net receipts from revolving debt of million to finance the acquisition of the westville and lima divisions 
cash used for financing in fiscal reflected early extinguishment of the million principal balance on our senior subordinated notes  using proceeds from our senior secured bank credit facility described below  as well as amounts used to pay down our revolving credit facility during the year 
at december   credit availability under the senior secured credit facility was million

interest payments assume debt is held to maturity 
for variable rate debt the current interest rates applicable as of december  were assumed for the remainder of the term 
lease obligations primarily relate to store locations for our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
a discussion of lease commitments can be found in 
table of contents part ii  item in this report under note leases in notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments under critical accounting policies  below 
includes amounts classified as imputed interest 
our benefit obligations include obligations related to sponsored defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
for a further discussion see part ii  item in this report under note pension and other post retirement benefits 
the majority of our purchase obligations involve purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business  which are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within very short time horizons 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable upon shipment of the underlying product 
the purchase obligations shown in this table also exclude agreements that are cancelable by us without significant penalty  which include contracts for routine outsourced services 
the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table represents the amount of product we are contractually obligated to purchase to earn million in upfront contract monies received 
should we not be able to fulfill these purchase obligations  we would be only obligated to pay back the unearned upfront contract monies 
we have also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of december  commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than over commitments committed year years years years in thousands standby letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually

senior secured credit facility our senior secured credit facility consists of million in revolving credit  all of which may be used for loans  and up to million of which may be used for letters of credit  and a million term loan b 
the term loan b portion of the facility was million as of december  of which million has been permanently paid down 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the eurodollar rate or the prime rate  plus in either case a margin spread that is dependent on our total leverage ratio 
we pay a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin spreads and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on changes to our total leverage ratio defined by the applicable credit agreement 
at december  and december  the margin spreads for the revolver and term loan b maintained as eurodollar loans were and  respectively  and the commitment commission was 
the margin spread for the revolver maintained at the prime rate was 
the credit facility requires us to hedge a certain portion of such borrowings through the use of interest rate swaps  as we have done historically 
at december   credit availability under the senior secured credit facility was million 

table of contents on february   we entered into a first amendment to our credit facility permitting us to enter into the asset purchase agreement with roundy s and to close and finance the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
on november  we entered into a second amendment to our credit facility which changed the existing total leverage ratio covenant and increased the margin spread whenever the total leverage ratio covenant exceeds to 
our senior secured credit facility represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that facility is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability 
among the most significant of these restrictive covenants are financial covenants which require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage and leverage 
these ratios are based on ebitda  on a rolling four quarter basis  with some adjustments consolidated ebitda 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined in our bank credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  upfront fees and expenses incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of the credit agreement  and non cash charges such as lifo charges  closed store lease costs  asset impairments and share based compensation  less cash payments made during the current period on certain non cash charges recorded in prior periods 
in addition  for purposes of determining compliance with prescribed leverage ratios and adjustments in the credit facility s margin spread and commitment commission  consolidated ebitda is calculated on a pro forma basis that takes into account all permitted acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant four quarter computation period 
consolidated ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to working capital coverage the ratio of the sum of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus up to million of additional secured indebtedness permitted to be issued under the new credit agreement 
the financial covenants specified in the credit agreement  as amended  vary over the term of the credit agreement and can be summarized as follows for the fiscal periods ending financial covenants closest to required ratio interest coverage ratio through and thereafter minimum total leverage ratio through through through and thereafter maximum senior secured leverage ratio through through and thereafter maximum working capital ratio through through thereafter minimum 
table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants as defined in our credit agreement which are summarized as follows financial covenant required ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio minimum total leverage ratio maximum senior secured leverage ratio maximum working capital ratio minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to interest expense for such period 
total outstanding debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
total outstanding senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
ratio of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus certain additional secured debt 
any failure to comply with any of these financial covenants would constitute an event of default under the bank credit agreement  entitling a majority of the bank lenders to  among other things  terminate future credit availability under the agreement and accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement

the credit agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability to incur debt including guaranteeing the debt of others and liens  acquire or dispose of assets  pay dividends on and repurchase our stock  make capital expenditures and make loans or advances to others  including customers 
convertible subordinated debt on march  we completed a private placement of million in aggregate issue price or million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated convertible notes due the funds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions from roundy s 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 

table of contents cash interest at the rate of per year is payable semi annually on the issue price of the notes until march  after that date  cash interest will not be payable  unless contingent cash interest becomes payable  and original issue discount for non tax purposes will accrue on the notes at a daily rate of per year until the maturity date of the notes 
on the maturity date of the notes  a holder will receive  per note 
contingent cash interest will be paid on the notes during any six month period  commencing march   if the average market price of a note for a ten trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the accreted principal amount of the note  plus accrued cash interest  if any 
the contingent cash interest payable with respect to any six month period will equal an annual rate of of the average market price of the note for the ten trading day measurement period described above 
the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder  only upon the occurrence of certain events  at an adjusted conversion rate of shares initially shares of our common stock per  principal amount at maturity of notes equal to an adjusted conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will pay the holder the conversion value in cash up to the accreted principal amount of the note and the excess conversion value  if any  in cash  stock or a combination of both  at our option 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of the issuance of the notes 
holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of the issuance of the notes 
in addition  upon specified change in control events  each holder will have the option  subject to certain limitations  to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of such holder s notes 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes 
in accordance with that agreement  we filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  a shelf registration statement covering the resale by security holders of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  redemption of senior subordinated notes on december   we redeemed the million in senior subordinated notes the notes due at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the redemption date 
we drew under the term loan b to fund the redemption of these notes 
charges recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of for redemption of the notes and the refinancing of our credit facility included a call premium of million and million for unamortized finance costs and original issue discount charge 
debt obligations generally for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of december  fixed rate variable rate fair value amount rate fair value amount rate in thousands thereafter derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our 
table of contents exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap and commodity swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are recognized as an adjustment to expense in the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in the results of operations 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  and december  and their fair values are summarized as follows december  december  in thousands  except percentages notional amount pay fixed receive variable fair value asset average receive rate for effective swaps average pay rate for effective swaps all of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  will expire in fiscal and the fair value gains reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassed into income as they expire 
the company uses commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
the agreements call for an exchange of payments with the company making payments based on fixed price per gallon and receiving payments based on floating prices  without an exchange of the underlying commodity amount upon which the payments are based 
at december   the company had no outstanding commodity swap agreements 
the fair market value of the commodity swaps totaled million as of december  all of the commodity swaps expired in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates 
table of contents that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these allowances 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sub lessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sub lessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
all of the guarantees were issued prior to december  and therefore were not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers and other third parties 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million as of december  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further 
table of contents deterioration of accounts  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk for more information regarding customer exposure and credit risk 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate we utilize to evaluate potential investments 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation of future results could be materially affected by different judgments as to competition  strategies and market conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results 
goodwill goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangible assets annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by us  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results and impairment of the goodwill 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the income tax expense reflected in our statements of income is different than that shown on our tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an 
table of contents expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is unlikely  we must establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax returns but we have not recognized the items as an expense in our statements of income 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our income tax expense  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves for income tax contingencies when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest and penalties 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
a basis point change in discount rates would increase our liability by approximately million vendor allowances and credits as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
we also establish reserves for future repayments to vendors for disputed payment deductions related to accounts payable audits  promotional allowances and other items 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  using the modified prospective transition method 
beginning in  our results of operations reflect compensation expense for newly issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted under our stock incentive plans  for the unvested portion of previously issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted  and for our employee stock purchase plan 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in 
table of contents accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
significant judgment is required in selecting the assumptions used for estimating fair value of share based compensation as well estimating forfeiture rates 
further  any awards with performance conditions that can affect vesting also add additional judgment in determining the amount expected to vest 
there can be significant volatility in many of our assumptions and therefore our estimates of fair value  forfeitures  etc 
are sensitive to changes in these assumptions 
new accounting standards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  using the modified prospective transition method as described in part ii  item  note in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  ie  the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value instruments 
fasb does not require any new fair value measurements  but applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal 
we believe that implementation of fasb will have little or no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans collectively  postretirement benefit plans to fully recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position and provide additional disclosures 
on december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas the effect of adopting sfas on our financial condition at december  has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition at december  or january  sfas s provisions regarding the change in measurement date of postretirement plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date that corresponds with our year end for our pension plan 
see part ii  item  note for further discussion on the effect of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures 
on december   we adopted sab our adoption of sab did not impact our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of our debt obligations outstanding  and derivatives employed from time to time to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and diesel fuel prices 
we do not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
see disclosures set forth under item under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents the estimate of the differential between interest payable and interest receivable under the swap agreements implied by the yield curve utilized to compute the fair value of the interest rate swaps
