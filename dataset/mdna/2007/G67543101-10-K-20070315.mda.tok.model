overview we are one of the world s leading providers of software solutions for digital and interactive television 
we derive our revenues from the licensing of our core middleware software and related technologies  the licensing and distribution of our interactive content and applications and the delivery of professional services 
we typically receive one time royalty fees from network operators or manufacturers of set top boxes once a set top box  which incorporates our software  has been shipped to  or activated by  the network operator 
however  we have recently signed subscription based licensing agreements under which we will receive monthly payments for each set top box that includes our software that our customers deploy  for so long as those set top boxes remain active 
as we pursue additional subscription based arrangements  our revenue model may change over time 
we also receive ongoing license fees for various other software products that we sell 
in addition  we receive professional services fees from consulting  engineering and training engagements  fees for the maintenance and support of our products and fees from revenue sharing arrangements related to the use of our interactive content and applications 
recent events on january   kudelski completed its previously announced stock purchase transaction with liberty  pursuant to which kudelski acquired  of our class a ordinary shares and  of our class b ordinary shares from liberty 
the shares acquired by kudelski collectively represent an economic interest of approximately and a voting interest of approximately in our company  based on the number of our ordinary shares outstanding as of january  we were not a direct party to that transaction 
pursuant to an agreement we previously entered into with liberty in february  we expect to receive a capital contribution of up to million in cash  representing of the premium received by liberty in the kudelski transaction 
we received million of this amount on the closing date of the kudelski transaction and may receive up to an additional million in cash in early after expiration of an indemnity period specified in the stock purchase agreement between liberty and kudelski in addition our board of directors has recently appointed andre kudelski as our chairman of the board and alan a 
guggenheim as our chief executive officer replacing james a 
chiddix 
in connection with and as a condition to the closing of the kudelski transaction  a majority of our board of directors changed 
joseph deiss  lucien gani  alan a 
guggenheim  andr kudelski  mercer reynolds  pierre roy and claude smadja were appointed to serve on our board of directors  and robert r 
bennett  anthony g 
werner and michael zeisser resigned from our board of directors  effective as of the close of the transaction 
on february   j 
timothy bryan also resigned from our board of directors 
a majority of our board of directors now consist of persons designated by kudelski 
as of december   general instrument beneficially owned  shares of our class b ordinary shares 
in january  general instrument exercised its right to convert those class b ordinary shares into the same number of our class a ordinary shares 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future 
table of contents events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting polices and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  and restructuring costs 
all of these accounting policies and estimates  together with their underlying assumptions  and their impact on our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap as has been prescribed for the software industry  the principal policies of which are reflected in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
the application of sop requires judgment about a number of matters  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement exists 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue to recognize currently and which portions to defer and recognize in later periods 
in some cases  we may  therefore  reflect the expenses associated with a licensing transaction before we are able to recognize the revenue related to that license  even if we have actually invoiced the customer or received a cash payment from that customer 
in other cases  we may accumulate costs in the same manner as inventory costs  and charge those costs to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
our judgments and estimates regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
because terms of our licensing arrangements may differ for various customers  including subscription based or one time royalty arrangements  we often may apply different recognition policies to different customer contracts depending upon those particular terms 
as indicated above  we provide a comprehensive suite of professional engineering and consulting services on a worldwide basis in support of our product offerings 
such services may include one or more of the following middleware porting  customization  implementation and integration  the design  development or construction of software and systems  and system maintenance and support 
professional services earned from software development contracts  customization services and implementation support are generally recognized using contract accounting on the percentage of completion basis in accordance with the provisions of sop if a revenue contract involves the provision of multiple elements  total estimated contract revenues are allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
in the event that fair value is not determinable for each service element of a multiple element contract  the contract is considered to be one accounting unit 
if it is reasonably assured that no loss will be incurred under the contract  we recognize service revenues using the percentage of completion method using a zero profit methodology until the services subject to contract accounting services are complete 
if the arrangement includes the future delivery of specified software products for which we do not have evidence of fair value  we defer all revenue and recognize such revenue upon delivery of the services and such specified deliverables based on the completed contract method 
in such instances  we accumulate directly allocable contract costs in the same manner as inventory costs 
these costs are then charged to operations as the related contract revenues are recognized 
if total costs are estimated to exceed the estimated contract revenues for the arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is complete 

table of contents the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognized may have been different if other assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently  we maintain a partial valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
adjustments may be required in the future if our estimate of the realizable amount of deferred tax assets changes 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  property and equipment  other assets and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and in the case of goodwill  at least annually 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the most significant assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we continuously monitor our organizational structure and associated operating expenses 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken periodically to restructure the business 
restructuring activities may include terminating employees  abandoning excess lease space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs depend on numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected  the cost to exit existing commitments and fair value estimates 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
share based compensation we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal and have accounted for share based compensation since january  in accordance with that accounting policy 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
our computation of expected lives has been determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards  vesting schedules  unique historical events  and expectations of future employee behavior 
our computation of expected volatility has been based on historical volatility of our stock price 
we have based the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on 
table of contents united states treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
while we believe that these assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that actual experience may not differ materially from these assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no widely accepted market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values  except for options subject to variable accounting 
the guidance in sfas r and sab no 
 interaction between fasb statement no 
r  and certain sec rules and regulations regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangement for public companies  sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimates of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report on form k for further information regarding the impact of sfas r on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
fin also requires expanded disclosures including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations and financial position 
fin is effective for fiscal years 
table of contents beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact of the recognition and measurement requirements of fin on our existing tax positions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab the adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we have prepared a report  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  which evaluates our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that complete report  as well as our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and our remediation efforts  is included under item a of this annual report on form k  which investors should read in its entirety 
we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
while those controls may be expected to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting  we do not expect that such controls will prevent all errors and fraud 
we monitor our controls and maintain those controls as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
as we assessed our internal control over financial reporting  we sought to identify various deficiencies or weaknesses that we may have and to correct those deficiencies or weaknesses as promptly as practicable 
we are required to disclose any material weaknesses that we have identified 
the public company accounting oversight board  which was established under the sarbanes oxley act  defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
we also maintain a system of disclosure controls that have been designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the securities exchange act of  including this annual report on form k  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec 
based on our assessment  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our system of disclosure controls were effective as of december  in connection with those conclusions  we determined that we had fully remediated the material weaknesses previously identified in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  these efforts are described more fully in item a of this annual report on form k

we generally derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software 
royalties are paid by either the network operator or the set top box manufacturer depending upon our payment arrangements with those customers 
we recognize royalties upon receipt of royalty reports reflecting unit shipments or activation of our software by network operators or manufacturers 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon initial delivery of the software to our customers  provided all the criteria of sop and related accounting principles have been met 
we have historically realized revenues through one time royalty payments and ongoing license fees 
more recently  we have entered into license agreements with network operators that will pay us under a subscription based model  pursuant to which we are paid a monthly fee for each set top box that is deployed by the network operator for so long as that box remains in use by the network operator 
we expect  in the future  to seek additional licensing arrangements of this nature  which  if we are successful  may affect our revenues over a period of time 
we also derive license fees from the licensing of other software products  such as opentv streamer  opentv software developers kit  and our advanced advertising products 
license fees can be one time purchases by our customers and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  or  in the case of our advanced advertising products  can also be in the form of a recurring license fee 
our royalties usually result from several different types of arrangements 
in the case of our set top box software  these may include initial deployments by new customers  the activation of new subscribers by existing customers  the shipment of additional set top boxes as replacements for older or defective set top boxes or for purposes of simply upgrading existing set top boxes  or sales of new products or services by the network operators that require new or updated set top boxes 
we have historically provided various types of volume discounts to our customers and expect that we will continue to do so in the future 
unless we are able to offset anticipated discounts through a change in product mix  upgrades to our software or other methods which typically enable us to charge higher fees  we may experience slower royalty growth as discounting is triggered 
specific royalty trends associated with set top box deployments by our customers are difficult to discern in many cases  as we do not control or directly influence actual deployment schedules of our customers 
royalties and licenses for increased to million compared to europe  middle east and africa accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in bskyb directly and indirectly  primarily through three of our customers who sell set top boxes to bskyb  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues for overall  revenues for the region increased million from  principally as a result of a net increase in set top box royalty revenues 
royalties and licenses from bskyb were million higher than in  primarily as a result of increased set top box shipments that included our software for personal video recording  or pvr  by the manufacturers who manufacture set top boxes for bskyb 
we typically generate higher royalty rates from set top boxes that include our pvr software  such as the set top boxes shipped to bskyb  and we would expect the number of pvr shipments to increase as network operators seek to deploy more pvr functionality in the future 
royalties and licenses from other customers were million higher than in  primarily as a result of increased standard set top box shipments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in royalty and license revenues from sky italia  which resulted from a reduction in set top box shipments by sky italia in compared to 
table of contents the americas region accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies corporation  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and license revenues for overall  royalties and license revenues for the region increased million from royalty and license revenues from echostar were million lower than in total revenues from echostar were affected  in part  by a reduction in echostar set top box shipments in as compared to because we previously committed to develop a limited number of unspecified future applications pursuant to an applications development agreement entered into contemporaneously with the middleware license agreement  the royalty payments we have received from echostar under that license agreement have been amortized over its term which expires in september we have agreed with echostar to extend the term of the applications development through the end of april we are engaged in discussions with echostar regarding a renewal of our applications development agreement as well as other licensing agreements  and while we expect to renew and extend these agreements  the terms of any such renewals or extensions may have a significant effect on our revenue recognition for echostar payments in the future 
license revenues from advanced advertising related products accounted for an increase of million from  principally as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the cable tv advertising inventory management assets of cam systems  llc  which we refer to as cams  and its affiliates in september  with other customers accounting for a net increase of million 
the asia pacific region accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in overall  royalties and licenses increased million from we recognized million in license revenues from the early termination of a licensing agreement for our opentv participate product  with the remaining net increase of million resulting primarily from increased set top box shipments in the region 
royalties and licenses for increased to million compared to europe  middle east and africa accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in bskyb directly and indirectly  primarily through three of our customers who sell set top boxes to bskyb  accounted for million  or  and sky italia accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues for overall  royalties and licenses for the region decreased by million from  principally as a result of million less in royalties and licenses revenues from sky italia in the decrease in revenues from sky italia resulted from a reduction in the royalty rate paid by sky italia over the course of  which related to a volume discount we offered sky italia when it became a customer 
the decrease from sky italia was partially offset by an increase of million in royalties and licenses revenue for bskyb  primarily as a result of increased set top box shipments by the three manufacturers who manufactured set top boxes for bskyb  and an increase of million in royalties and licenses revenues from other customers in the region 
the americas region accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies corporation  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues for overall  royalties and licenses in the region increased by million in approximately million of that increase was realized from echostar  with the remaining million realized from other customers 
the increase in royalties was due to the effect of an increase in the amortization of echostar payments during  which was partially offset by a reduction in echostar set top box shipments in compared to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately million in royalties and licenses revenue in overall  royalties and licenses revenue for the region increased million in compared to royalties and licenses from shipments of our integrated browser in certain digital tv sets distributed within japan accounted for million of this increase  while sales of million to other customers accounted for the remaining increase 

table of contents services and other 
services and other revenues consist primarily of professional services  maintenance and support  training  service usage fees and revenue shares and programming fees 
professional service revenues are generally derived from consulting engagements for network operators  set top box manufacturers and system integrators 
maintenance  support and training revenues are generally realized as services are provided to network operators and set top box manufacturers 
a set top box manufacturer s decision to purchase maintenance and support from us depends largely on whether such manufacturer is actively shipping set top boxes with our software or reasonably expects to do so in quantities large enough to justify payment of these amounts  which  in both cases  is dependent upon such manufacturer s supply contracts with network operators and set top box demand by the network operator 
service usage fees and revenue shares are generally derived from our playjam games channels  our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channels  and revenue shares for advertising and other interactive services 
we also derived programming fees from our nascar agreement  which was not renewed for the season  and from other programmers 
for  the nascar service generated revenues of million and our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel generated revenues of million 
these were offset by related costs of million and million  respectively  which were included in cost of services in in october  we signed an agreement to sell our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel listing on bskyb s network in the united kingdom and the customer list for the fixed odds gaming business operated by our bettingcorp subsidiary 
the transaction closed in the fourth quarter of  and as a result  we are no longer engaged in the fixed odds gaming business 
other than the betting and gaming channel listing and customer list  we retained all other intellectual property  technology and other assets owned by our bettingcorp subsidiary 
services and other revenue for increased by to million as compared to during  we realized increases of million in services and other revenues from advanced advertising related services and support primarily related to products acquired through our cams acquisition  of million in fees from middleware and integrated technologies development and integration service engagements  and of million in maintenance and support fees from other middleware and integrated technologies customers 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in playjam games channel fees resulting from increased competition and a termination of service on our playjam games channel in france that we initiated in late  a decrease of million resulting from increased competition and the fourth quarter closure of our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel in the united kingdom  and a net decline of million in services revenues from other customers 
as discussed in note and to our consolidated financial statements  beginning in we will no longer operate our nascar service or playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel 
as a result  we expect a decrease in both related service revenues and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs associated with these arrangements 
services and other revenue for increased by to million as compared to we experienced an increase of million in betting and gaming fees from customers of our wholly owned subsidiary  bettingcorp  due to increased service usage on bskyb 
we also realized an increase of million in advertising related service revenue from our cams acquisition  which was partially offset by decreased advertising related service revenues of million from other advertising customers 
in  we did not recognize any programming fees for nascar 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we renegotiated our nascar agreement in  and  as a result  we recognized million of additional revenue from providing these programming services in we also realized an increase of million in services revenues from other customers to whom we provided professional services 
these increases were offset partially by a decrease of million in playjam games channel fees resulting from increased competition and a termination of service on our playjam games channel in france that we initiated 
we also experienced a decrease of million in consulting work for motorola in

we also incurred an additional million of share based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas r in in addition  we experienced an increase of million in consulting and subcontractor costs associated with billable professional services engagements 
these increases were partially offset by a net decrease of million in network infrastructure and bandwidth costs associated with our playjam and playmontecarlo channels 
as discussed in note and to our consolidated financial statements  beginning in we will no longer operate our nascar service or playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel 
as a result  we expect a decrease in both related service revenues and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs associated with these arrangements 
for  the nascar service generated revenues of million and our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel generated revenues of million 
these were offset by costs of million and million  respectively  which were included in cost of services in

these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in consulting and subcontractor costs and third party material costs associated with billable professional services engagements  and a net increase of million in network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
nascar amendment 
during the second quarter of  we renegotiated an existing contract that our subsidiary  actv  had with in demand relating to the production of interactive programming for the nascar season and beyond 
as a result of this renegotiation  we reduced the estimated loss for that contract by million from the amount which had been accrued by actv in prior to our acquisition of actv 
this item was shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  no revenue or expenses were recorded prior to the renegotiation in as a result of the overall estimated losses expected under the assumed relationship 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of headcount and headcount related overhead costs  travel costs  consulting and subcontractor costs incurred for both new product development and enhancements to our existing software products and applications 
research and development remains important to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to focus on the timely development of new and enhanced interactive television products for our customers  and we plan to continue investing at levels that are sufficient to develop our technologies and product offerings 
research and development expenses for decreased from to million 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased to in as compared to in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease of million in headcount and headcount related overhead costs as the result of a reassignment of staff from research and development to cost of services and other in  and a decrease of million in depreciation expense as a result of fully depreciating certain fixed assets  which offset an increase of million for share based compensation included as a result of the adoption of sfas r in research and development expenses for increased from to million

professional fees for consulting  legal services and for work related to our audit and sarbanes oxley compliance efforts accounted for an increase of 
table of contents million 
we also incurred an increase of million for share based compensation costs included as a result of the adoption of sfas r in general and administrative expenses for decreased from to million 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in as compared to in that decrease resulted from a decrease in litigation fees of million  a decrease in facilities expenses and outside services costs of million and a reduction in depreciation expenses of million 
the decrease was mostly offset by an increase in headcount related overhead costs of million 
restructuring and impairment costs 
during the last three years we have undertaken several initiatives to reduce operating expenses around the world 
as a result of these actions  employees were included in termination plans in  seven employees in  and employees in provision was also made for excess office space and the write down of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment that were abandoned 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which included a fourth quarter restructuring provision of million related to the workforce reduction of our playjam and playmontecarlo operations in the united kingdom and of million related to the plan to terminate three senior executives in our united states corporate headquarters 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which included a first quarter restructuring and impairment provision of million related to the closure of our lexington  massachusetts facility  a second quarter restructuring provision of million for excess office space in new york  and a third quarter restructuring provision of million for a workforce reduction in the united states and switzerland 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of three to years 
as noted above  cost of royalties and licenses includes amounts relating to the amortization of developed technologies and patents 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase resulted from the inclusion of certain intangible assets from our cams acquisition 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the decrease resulted from the expiration of the amortization period for certain intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we were informed by in demand that nascar would not be renewing their distribution arrangement with them  and that as a result  in demand would not be renewing our production agreement 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our applications segment representing the entire goodwill balance for this reporting unit 
interest income interest income for was million as compared with million for  primarily a result of increased interest rates and an increase in our investment portfolio and cash position 
in  interest income was million as compared with million for  due also to increased interest rates and a small overall increase in our investment portfolio and cash position 

table of contents other income and expense items for  net other income of million primarily included a gain of million from the sale of a cost investment  and a gain of million related to a contract amendment with sun microsystems for use of its java technology in our products 
that amendment reduced our payment obligation to sun to an amount that was million less than the amount we had previously accrued as a charge in in respect of that agreement 
minority interest in november  we established spyglass integration  inc  a co owned venture with motorola 
we recorded a gain with respect to motorola s share of losses in this venture of million for and million for income taxes we estimate that we had net united states federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at the end of  although our ability to make use of those tax loss carryforwards may be limited under applicable tax regulations 
the calculation of those tax loss carryforwards is a complex matter and may require a reassessment from time to time  which could result in changes to that estimate 
for all periods presented  substantially all federal tax benefits related to our losses have been offset by an increase in the valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax assets 
notwithstanding those federal tax loss carryforwards  we are subject to income taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and we have foreign taxes withheld from certain royalty payments 
our income tax expense was million for  primarily attributable to state taxes and increases to reserves for identified potential foreign tax exposures  net of the following benefits during the second quarter of  we obtained tax refunds from amended returns in australia and a swiss ruling on the intercompany cost sharing agreement to increase the swiss net operating loss resulting in recognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
our income tax expense of million for was primarily attributable to foreign and state taxes of million 
these were offset by a benefit resulting from a reduction in our valuation allowance for swiss deferred tax assets where management believed it was more likely than not that the benefit will be realized 
business segment results our chief operating decision maker codm is our chief executive officer 
our codm assesses our results and financial performance  and prepares our internal budgeting reports  on the basis of three segments the middleware and integrated technologies business  the applications business  and the bettingcorp business 
we have prepared this segment analysis in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our middleware and integrated technologies business is composed of set top box middleware and embedded browser technologies  as well as software components that are deployed at the network operator s headend 
our applications business includes our advanced advertising  playjam and nascar products and related technologies 
our bettingcorp business includes our fixed odds and other betting and gaming applications  the development and operation of our ultimate one platform and the marketing of our opentv participate product that is based on the ultimate one technology 
as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  beginning in we will no longer operate our nascar service or playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel 

table of contents our management reviews and assesses the contribution margin of each of these segments  which is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
we define contribution margin for these purposes as segment revenues less related  direct or indirect  allocable costs  including headcount and headcount related overhead costs  consulting and subcontractor costs  travel  marketing and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
there are significant judgments management makes with respect to the direct and indirect allocation of costs that may affect the calculation of contribution margins 
while management believes these and other related judgments are reasonable and appropriate  others could assess such matters in ways different than our company s management 
contribution margin is a non gaap financial measure which excludes unallocated corporate overhead  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangibles  other income  minority interest  restructuring provisions  and unusual items such as contract amendments that mitigated potential loss positions 
these exclusions reflect costs not considered directly allocable to individual business segments and result in a definition of contribution margin that does not take into account the substantial cost of doing business 
management believes that segment contribution margin is a helpful measure in evaluating the performance of our business segments 
while our management may consider contribution margin to be an important measure of comparative operating performance  this measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  loss from operations  net loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are otherwise presented in our financial statements 
in addition  our calculation of contribution margin may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be affected 
because these segments reflect the manner in which management reviews our business  they necessarily involve judgments that management believes are reasonable in light of the circumstances under which they are made 
these judgments may change over time or may be modified to reflect new facts or circumstances 
segments may also be changed or modified to reflect technologies and applications that are newly created  or that change over time  or other business conditions that evolve  each of which may result in reassessing specific segments and the elements included within each of those segments 
recent events  including as discussed further in note subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements contained as part iv of this annual report on form k  may affect the manner in which we present segments in the future 
in connection with the sale by liberty of its controlling interest in our company to kudelski in january  a new chief executive officer and codm has been recently appointed 
in addition  the sale of our customer list and channel placement for playmontecarlo in december means that the assets included within our bettingcorp segment as of the date of this annual report on form k are different than those included when we initially began reporting this segment 
those changes  among other considerations  may affect the manner in which we report our segments in the future

services and other consists primarily of professional services consulting engagements for network operators  set top box manufacturers and system integrators and maintenance  support and training 
this category accounted for of segment revenues in  an increase from in  and unchanged from in the increases in were due to discrete middleware professional service projects and increased maintenance and support fees from customers in as described under services and other in revenues above 
the decrease in was due to fewer professional services projects  primarily due to the discontinuance of ongoing services to motorola in middleware and integrated technologies costs consist primarily of headcount and headcount related overhead costs and consulting and subcontractor costs associated with billable professional services engagements 
total contribution margin for the middleware and integrated technologies business in decreased from to million resulting from increased headcount and headcount related costs  and consulting and subcontractor costs  which exceeded the increased middleware and integrated technology business revenues due to a continued investment in this segment 
in  total contribution margin for the middleware and integrated technologies business increased from to million  primarily as a result of higher revenues  which were only partially offset by increased costs in that segment 
applications revenues from the applications business for were million  an increase of million  or  from million in for  revenues from products acquired through our cams acquisition accounted for increases of million of application licenses and million of application services  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in playjam games channel fees resulting from increased competition and termination of service on our playjam games channel in france that we initiated in for  playjam games fees accounted for of segment revenues  a decrease from in the remaining decrease of million was as a result of decreased revenues from other customers in as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  beginning in we will no longer operate our nascar service 
as a result  we expect a decrease in both related service revenue and associated network infrastructure and bandwidth costs

these revenues were offset by related costs of million  which were included in cost of services for revenues from the applications business for were million  an increase of million  or  from million in for  playjam games fees accounted for of segment revenues  a decrease from in we experienced a decrease of million in playjam games channel fees in as a result of competitive pressures and a termination of our playjam games channel in france that we initiated in advertising revenue increased million in  of which million was attributable to increased royalties and licenses and million was attributable to increased services and other revenue 
nearly all of that million increase was due to the cams acquisition in september  as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we did not recognize any programming fees for nascar in as described above  we renegotiated our nascar production agreement in and  as a result  recognized million of additional revenue for this service in total contribution loss for the applications business improved in  primarily as a result of increased revenues  including revenues net of related directly allocable costs from our cams acquisition  as described above  and as a result of reduced network infrastructure and bandwidth costs associated with reduced revenues from our playjam channels 
total contribution loss for the applications business improved in  primarily as a result of increased revenues  including revenues from the cams acquisition  as described above 
bettingcorp revenues from the bettingcorp business for decreased by million  or  to million which is primarily a result of a decrease of million resulting from increased competition and the fourth quarter closure of our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel in the united kingdom  which was partially offset by increased revenues of million from our opentv participate product 
revenues from the bettingcorp business for 
table of contents increased to million 
this increase was primarily due to increased service usage on bskyb and due to increases in professional services from other customers 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  beginning in we will no longer operate our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel 
as a result  we expect a decrease in both related service revenue and associated network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
for  our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel generated revenues of million 
these revenues were offset by related costs of million  which were included in cost of services for contribution loss for the bettingcorp business decreased to million in as a result of a reduction in infrastructure and bandwidth costs and lower revenue sharing costs associated with reduced revenues from our playmontecarlo channel 
total contribution loss for the bettingcorp business increased in as compared to although revenue increased as described above  associated bandwidth and revenue shares had increased proportionately  in addition to increases in other operating expenses 
deferred revenue when we apply our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred  principally in terms of sop  sop and sab in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
we have entered into multiple element arrangements for products and services with customers including time warner cable  essel group which operates the dishtv network in india  echostar s dish network  unitedglobalcom or ugc  a subsidiary of liberty global  foxtel  austar  and comcast 
portions of the amounts that we have invoiced to essel group  echostar  ugc  foxtel and austar under those arrangements have been deferred and will be included as revenue over time in our middleware and integrated technologies business 
portions of those amounts that we have invoiced to comcast under our agreement with comcast will be included as revenue over time in our applications business 
the arrangements with these customers include maintenance and support  for which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value did not exist at the time the respective agreement was signed with each customer 
in addition  several of these arrangements provide for the delivery of specified future products  for which such evidence of fair value also did not exist 
all revenues under arrangements for which we are obligated to provide specified future products are initially deferred 
upon final delivery of all specified products under each arrangement  we will recognize revenue either over the remaining contractual period of support or over the remaining period during which maintenance and support is expected to be provided 
as of december   we recorded million in deferred revenue compared with million at the end of of that total deferred amount at december   million  or  was deferred as a result of the arrangements with essel group  echostar  ugc  foxtel  austar  and comcast described in the preceding paragraphs 
the remaining million  or  of our deferred revenue as of december  was principally attributable to maintenance and support and professional services arrangements with other customers  which are typically short term in nature 
based on our current estimates of final delivery for all specified products  we expect the following recognition of the million of unearned revenue at december  resulting from the essel group  echostar  ugc  foxtel  austar  and comcast arrangements expected recognition year ending december  of unearned revenue in millions thereafter as noted in our critical accounting policies  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
as a result  the actual revenue recognized from these arrangements  and the timing of that recognition may differ from the amounts identified in this table 
while management believes that this 
table of contents information is a helpful measure in evaluating the company s performance  investors should understand that unless  and until  the company is actually able to recognize these amounts as revenue in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that the conditions to recording that revenue will be satisfied 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television market in general will prove to be accurate  our funding requirements may differ from our current expectations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which was an increase of million from the prior year 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
taking into account short term and long term marketable debt securities of million  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million as of december  as compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the mix of cash and short term and longer term securities may change in the future as we make decisions regarding the composition of our investment portfolio 
our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue 
the primary uses of cash are payroll  general operating expenses and cost of revenues 
our cash balances as of december  were positively affected by million of cash provided by financing activities and million of cash generated from operating activities 
these effects were offset by a negative cash flow from investing activities of million  resulting mainly from purchases of property and equipment 
our cash balances as of december   were positively affected by million in cash from investing activities  which included million in cash received from the sale of a cost investment and by net cash generated from operating activities of million 
cash generated from operating activities was million for  as compared with million for and cash used in operating activities of million for although the net loss was million greater than in  the net loss included a million gain on the sale of a cost method investment 
the loss also included the share based compensation costs as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
no corresponding share based compensation expense was required to be recorded in the reduced net loss after taking into account these items  was only partially offset by an increase in working capital  resulting in net cash generated from operations of million higher than in in  increased revenues and reduced operating expenses resulted in a significantly reduced net loss 
in addition  favorable working capital movements also improved operating cash flows by million  primarily as a result of increased deferred revenues of million which offset other working capital changes of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for purchases of property and equipment in the amount of million were partially offset by net proceeds from marketable security investment activities of million 
for  net cash provided by investing activities was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million from the sale of an investment previously accounted for at cost 
in addition  net sales of marketable debt securities of million were used to fund the million cash portion of our acquisition costs for the cams acquisition  and also to fund capital equipment expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for  cash provided from financing activities was million 
for  cash provided from financing activities was million due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
the portfolio consists of highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities of the united states government and agencies  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit that predominantly have maturities of less than three years 
all investments are made in accordance with our written investment policy  which has been approved by our board of directors 

table of contents as noted in recent events above  pursuant to a february agreement between us and liberty  liberty is expected to pay us a capital contribution of up to million of the proceeds from the sale of its shares to kudelski 
we received million of this amount in january and may receive up to an additional million in cash in early after expiration of an indemnity period specified in the stock purchase agreement between liberty and kudelski 
commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions due in due in due in due in total or after operating leases obligations noncancellable purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have the right to terminate  without penalty  two of our operating leases prior to their scheduled expiration 
if we exercise those early termination rights  beginning in our future minimum lease commitments would be reduced by an aggregate of million over the current remaining life of those leases 
we have not yet made any determination as to whether we intend to exercise any of those rights 
if we did exercise any such rights  while our commitments under those specific leases would be reduced  we might also be required to lease additional space to conduct our business and we cannot be certain  at this time  whether any such actions would possibly result in a net increase in our future minimum lease commitments 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for bandwidth  marketing  and other services 
future minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million and million for the years ending december  and december   respectively 
in addition  we also have arrangements with certain parties that provide for revenue sharing payments 
as of december   we had three standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million  two of which were issued to landlords of our leased properties  and one of which was issued to a sublessee at our new york facility which we vacated in the second quarter of for further information regarding the past accrual for excess facilities see note restructuring and impairment costs to our consolidated financial statements 
we pledged approximately million of restricted cash  which is included under other long term assets  and one certificate of deposit of million  which is included under long term marketable debt securities  as collateral in respect of these standby letters of credit 
indemnification in the normal course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers  subject to limitations  against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
costs related to these indemnification provisions are sometimes difficult to estimate 
while we have not historically experienced significant costs for these matters  there may be occasions in the ordinary course of our business where we assume litigation and other costs on behalf of our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial position depending upon the outcome of any specific matter 
we ordinarily seek to limit our liabilities in those arrangements in various respects  including monetarily  but the costs associated with any type of intellectual property indemnification arrangement continue to escalate in general  and especially in the technology sector 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities  investments in privately held companies and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands valuation of valuation of valuation of valuation of fair value as securities if securities if securities if securities if of december  interest rates interest rates interest rates interest rates decrease increase decrease increase marketable debt securities the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
a majority of our worldwide customers are invoiced and make payments in united states dollars  with the remainder invoiced by our non united states business units under contracts that require payments to be remitted in local currency 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we regularly assess foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations 
we did 
table of contents not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  options in hedging foreign currency exposures  or other hedging procedures  during and we expect over time  however  that an increased number of our european customers may seek to pay us in euros  which may affect our risk profile and require us to make use of appropriate hedging strategies 
while we anticipate a certain portion of our revenues in will be paid to us in euros  we do not believe that such payments will require a material change in our existing hedging policies
