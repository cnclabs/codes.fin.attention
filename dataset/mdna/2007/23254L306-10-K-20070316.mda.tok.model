overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and eventual commercialization of novel  mechanism targeted drugs to treat human cancers and other serious disorders 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology  or the processes by which cells divide and multiply 
we focus primarily on the discovery and development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including cyclin dependent kinase cdk and aurora kinase ak inhibitor s 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop cdk inhibitor drugs  we believe that our lead drug candidate  seliciclib  is the only orally available cdk inhibitor drug candidate currently in phase iib trials 
we are advancing three of our anticancer drug candidates  seliciclib  sapacitabine and cyc through in house research and development activities 
we have worldwide rights to commercialize 
table of contents seliciclib  sapacitabine and cyc and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
we are also progressing further novel drug series  principally for cancer  which are at earlier stages 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with our main research facility located in dundee  scotland  and a second research facility located in cambridge  england 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical  pre clinical and other drugs currently in development 
our operating expenses comprise research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  licensing revenue  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have received proceeds from the issuances of equity interests of million  net of issuance costs  from inception through december  which includes million raised through the private placement of common stock and warrants in the second quarter of our revenue has consisted of collaboration and grant revenue 
we have recognized revenues from inception through december  of million of which million is derived from fees under co llaborative agreements and million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards 
we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have also recognized amounts receivable from hm revenue customs of million for research and development tax credits since inception 
results of operations as explained in the notes to consolidated financial statements basis of presentation  in connection with the stock purchase agreement  cyclacel limited was considered to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of xcyte were recorded  as of march   at their respective fair values and added to those of cyclacel limited 
the results of operations and balance sheet data for reflect the results of the combined companies from march  through december  additionally  the historical results of operations and balance sheet data shown for comparative purposes in this form k reflect those of cyclacel limited prior to the reverse acquisition

table of contents in march  the company assumed an accrued restructuring liability in relation to the bothell manufacturing facility  calculated as the net present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses 
in september  the company entered into an exclusive subleasing agency agreement in an attempt to achieve the successful sublet of the facility 
as a result of the agreement  we recorded an additional provision in the third quarter of of  in recognition of commissions payable upon successful conclusion of a sublease agreement 
no such restructuring expense was recognized in the years ended december  and future as at december   the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility was million accounting for the estimated fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated sub lease income 
the restructuring liability is subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
we review these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the accrual if necessary 
these changes can be material 
other income expense other income expense is comprised of costs associated with an aborted ipo in  the change in valuation of the derivative  interest income and interest expense

the change in the derivative value of  in is associated with the dividend make whole payment on our outstanding convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
no such derivative valuation expense was recognized in the years ended december  and fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest income from million in to million in is primarily attributable to higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in following receipt of million being the net proceeds of our private placement in the second quarter and the million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments assumed on the stock purchase 
the increase in interest expense to million in as compared to  in resulted primarily from accretion expense associated with the bothell lease restructuring provision 
during the year ended december  we recognized accretion expense of million 
no such accretion expense was recognized in the years ended december  and fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income from million in to million in is primarily attributable to reducing average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in the future the valuation of the dividend make whole payment will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the derivative is dependent upon many factors  including estimated market volatility  and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 

table of contents a further accretion expense of approximately million associated with the bothell lease restructuring charge will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease through november income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred

fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable increased or million from million in to million in the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to income taxes paid by the company in that same year 
this increase was a reflection of the increased income taxes available to recover from the taxes paid in connection with the issue of group preferred d shares to certain directors and officers in march  prior to the stock purchase 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable fell or million from million in to million in this decrease was a reflection of a reduced level of qualifying research and development expenditure in the year ended december  combined with a decrease in income taxes available for recovery 
future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future and will elect to do so

since our inception  we have not generated any significant product revenue and have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of equity and preferred securities to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from operations and financing are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and other financial commitments through to at least the next months 

table of contents at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared with million at december  this higher balance at december  was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from the private placement  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments assumed on completion of the stock purchase and million received from our former parent company  described below 
on july   cyclacel group plc group signed a convertible loan note instrument constituting convertible unsecured loan notes 
on july    it entered into a facility agreement with scottish enterprise  as lender  whereby scottish enterprise subscribed for million approximately million of the convertible loan notes 
upon the completion of the stock purchase  the convertible loan notes held by scottish enterprise converted into  preferred d shares in satisfaction of all amounts owed by group under the convertible loan notes 
the number of preferred d shares that scottish enterprise received was calculated by dividing the principal amount outstanding under the loan note by pou nd 
scottish enterprise retains the ability it had under the facility agreement to receive a cash payment should the research operations in scotland be significantly reduced 
however  cyclacel has guaranteed the amount potentially due to scottish enterprise which would be calculated as a maximum of approximately million million less the market value of the shares held or would have held in the event they dispose of any shares by scottish enterprise at the time of any significant reduction in research facilities during the period ending on july  cyclacel was also a party to a long term debt instrument  a government loan of  that accrued interest at per annum  and this loan was wholly repaid in november the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commitments relating to our facilities  equipment leases and purchases as at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our short term investments as of december  consisted of million in corporate bonds and million in federal agency obligations with contractual maturities of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is minimal 
the corporate bonds in which we invest are rated a or better by both moody s and standard and poor s 
our cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in highly liquid money market accounts 
a hypothetical change in short term interest rates from those in effect at december  would not have a significant impact on our financial position or our expected results of operatio ns 
we do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments with interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations related to the operation of our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
at the end of each reporting period  income and expenses of the subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period and assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using either historical rates or the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging  however  we have entered into certain contracts denominated in foreign currencies and  therefore  we are subject to currency exchange risks 
as of december  differences on foreign currency translation of  are shown as a movement in oth er comprehensive income 
in the year ended december  exchange rate differences of  were charged in the statements of operations 
derivatives valuation risk the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock issued in november remained in place following completion of the stock purchase 
the terms of the convertible preferred stock include a dividend make whole payment feature 
this feature is considered to be an embedded derivative and was valued on the balance sheet at million at december  as the fair value of this derivative may fluctuate significantly from period to period  the resulting change in valuation may have a significant impact on our results of operations
