item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
we measure our market share based on data published annually by home channel news  or hcn 
we define market share as our sales as a percentage of the reported sales of the firms on hcn s list  as adjusted to eliminate firms that do not compete with us and  for certain firms  the portion of their sales attributable to businesses that do not compete with us 
as of december   we distributed more than  products to approximately  customers through our network of more than warehouses and third party operated warehouses which serve all major metropolitan markets in the united states 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 

table of contents acquisition of building products distribution division s assets from georgia pacific on march   bluelinx and our operating company entered into two separate definitive agreements to acquire the real estate and operating assets  respectively  of the division 
the transactions were consummated on may  we refer to the period prior to may  as the pre acquisition period 
the division s financial data for the pre acquisition period generally will not be comparable to our financial data for the period after the acquisition 
the principal factors affecting comparability are incremental costs that we will incur as a separate company  discussed in greater detail below  interest costs attributable to debt we have incurred in connection with the acquisition and mortgage refinancing transactions  and the effects of the purchase method of accounting applied to the acquisition transactions 
the acquisition of the assets of the division was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were accounted for at their fair market values at the date of consummation 
on may   we entered into a multi year supply agreement with georgia pacific 
under the agreement  we have exclusive distribution rights on certain products and certain customer segments 
georgia pacific is our largest vendor  with georgia pacific products representing approximately and of our purchases during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during the pre acquisition period  georgia pacific charged the division for the estimated cost of certain functions that were managed by georgia pacific and could reasonably be directly attributed to the operations of the division 
these costs included dedicated human resources  legal  accounting and information systems support 
the charges to the division were based on georgia pacific management s estimate of the services specifically used by the division 
where determinations based on specific usage alone were impracticable  other methods and criteria were used that management believes are equitable and provide a reasonable estimate of the cost attributable to the division 
the total of the allocations was million for the period from january  to may  certain general corporate expenses were not allocated to the division 
these expenses included portions of property and casualty insurance premiums  health and welfare administration costs  human resources administration costs  finance administration costs and legal costs 
we estimate that these incremental costs would have been approximately million for the period from january  to may  we believe the assumptions underlying the division s financial statements are reasonable 
however  the division s financial statements do not necessarily reflect what our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be  nor do they reflect what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate  independent company during the periods presented 

table of contents selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction

data for fiscal and fiscal is reported based on risi data provided at the time of our original disclosure for such periods and is not updated to reflect any revisions made by risi in subsequent periods 
we measure our growth in unit volume on a constant dollar basis compared to the weighted average growth of the foregoing end use indicators 
in addition  we measure our growth in specialty product unit volume and structural product unit volume compared to the weighted average growth rate of the foregoing end use indicators

market share cannot be calculated until home channel news issues updated market data for home channel news normally issues its annual market data for any given year in july or august of the following calendar year 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in product prices 
structural products prices can vary significantly based on short term and long term changes in supply and demand 
the prices of specialty products also can vary from time to time  although they generally are significantly less variable than structural products

basic and diluted earnings per share for the period from inception march  to january  were and  respectively 
for the period prior to may   there were no earnings per share as a result of the business operating for much of that period as a division of georgia pacific 
seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital and accounts receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season 
we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures  dividends and acquisitions 
we believe that the amounts available from this and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the division s principal source of liquidity historically had been the consolidated resources of georgia pacific 
part of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions 
accordingly  depending on the nature of the acquisition or currency  we may use cash or stock  or a combination of both  as acquisition currency 
our cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on the company s and the division s historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers  vendors and other outside sources and management s estimates  as appropriate 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all sales are recorded at gross in accordance with the guidance outlined by eitf and in accordance with standard industry practice 
the key indicators used to determine this are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment  we hold title to all reload inventory and are responsible for all product returns  we control the selling price for all channels  we select the supplier  and we bear all credit risk 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will be ultimately uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
at december   december  and january   these reserves totaled million  million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and uncollectible accounts have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
the market value of our inventory exceeded its cost at december  and december  additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged and inactive inventory 
the inactive reserve includes inventory that has had no sales in the past six months or has turn days in excess of days  excluding some specific specialty product items 
at december   december  and january   our damaged and inactive inventory reserves totaled million  million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to inactive estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal consideration received from vendors each year  we enter into agreements with many of our vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates  generally based on achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and various marketing allowances that are common industry practice 
we accrue for the receipt of vendor rebates based on purchases  and also reduce inventory value to reflect the net acquisition cost purchase price less expected purchase rebates 
at december   december  and january   the vendor rebate receivable totaled million  million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to rebate estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
there have been no adjustments to earnings resulting from the impairment of long lived assets for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates
