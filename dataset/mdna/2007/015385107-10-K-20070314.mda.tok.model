on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees and non employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense based on fair value at date of grant 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock options to employees using the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options granted at market value on the date of grant 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  therefore no prior period results have been restated 
the valuation model used to value stock options under sfas no 
r is the black scholes merton model  which is the same valuation model that was used prior to january  for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
under sfas no 
r an estimate must be made of the number of awards that are expected to vest and this forfeiture rate is applied to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized 
the forfeiture rate must be evaluated at each reporting period to determine if any changes should be made which could impact the amount of compensation cost that will be ultimately recognized 
in addition  the amount of compensation cost to be recognized is based on non substantive vesting periods attributable to retirement eligible employees 
alfa s total fair value based compensation expense associated with stock options that were not vested at january  was million and the weighted average period over which this expense will be recognized is years 
the company shares compensation cost with mutual based on alfa s management and operating agreement refer to note related party transactions 
future results of operations will depend in part on the company s ability to predict and control benefit and settlement expenses through underwriting criteria  product design and negotiation of favorable vendor contracts 
the company must also seek timely and accurate rate changes from insurance regulators in order to meet strategic business objectives 
selection of insurable risks  proper collateralization of loans and leases and continued staff development also impact the operating results of the company 
the company s inability to mitigate any or all risks mentioned above or other factors may adversely affect its profitability 
in evaluating the performance of the company s segments  management believes operating income serves as a meaningful tool for assessing the profitability of the company s ongoing operations 
operating income  a non gaap financial measure  is defined by the company as net income excluding net realized investment gains and losses  net of applicable taxes 
realized investment gains and losses are somewhat controllable by the company through the timing of decisions to sell securities 
therefore  realized investment gains and losses are not indicative of future operating performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the company s management to make significant estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time the financial statements are prepared 
in addition  management must ascertain the appropriateness and timing of any changes in these estimates and assumptions 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the company s financial statements and because of the possibility that subsequent events and available information may differ markedly from management s judgments at the time financial statements are prepared 
for the company  the areas most subject to significant management judgments include reserves for property casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses  reserves for future policy benefits  deferred policy acquisition costs  valuation of investments  and reserves for pending litigation 
the application of these critical accounting estimates impacts the values at which of the company s assets and of the company s liabilities are reported at december  and therefore have a direct effect on net earnings and stockholders equity 
the company s summary of significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements management has discussed the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company s audit committee has also reviewed the disclosures contained herein 
reserves for property casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances  historical trends  emergence patterns and settlement patterns 
reserves for reported losses are established on a case by case basis with the amounts determined by claims adjusters based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based primarily on historical emergence patterns with consideration given to many variables including statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
the company s internal actuarial staff conducts annual reviews of projected loss development information by line of business to assist management in making estimates of reserves for ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses payable 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness is established in the context of claim severity  loss ratio and trend factors  all of which are implicit in the liability estimates 
on an interim basis  the company s internal actuarial staff reviews the direct emergence for each line of business compared to the expected emergence implied by the most recent annual review 
if the emergence is not within acceptable bounds  the opinion on reserve adequacy is revised and reserve amounts are adjusted 
otherwise  ibnr reserves are adjusted as changes in exposure indicate that additional reserves are needed until the next annual review is completed 
the following methodologies are used to develop a range of probable outcomes for estimated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves during the annual review  with the catastrophes methods used during both annual and interim reviews normal loss reserves reported loss development paid loss development bornhuetter ferguson methods paid and reported cape cod method paid and reported counts and averages calendar year methods judgmental methods thomas mack loss adjustment expenses reserves reported loss development paid loss development bornhuetter ferguson methods paid and reported cape cod method paid and reported ratio methods calendar year methods judgmental methods accrual methods catastrophes regression fit on incremental payments regression on reported claim counts leakage method comparison to past catastrophe development 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the annual actuarial reviews are presented to management with a point estimate established within the range of probable outcomes for evaluating the adequacy of reserves and determination of the appropriate reserve value to be included in the financial statements 
management establishes reserves slightly above mid point to include an estimated provision for uncertainty and to minimize the necessity for changing historical estimates 
although management uses many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate reserves  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
management establishes reserves for loss adjustment expenses that are not attributable to a specific claim 
these reserves are referred to as defense and cost containment dcc and adjusting and other expenses ao 
dcc and ao reserves are recorded to establish the liability for settling and defending claims that have been incurred  but have not yet been completely settled 
for ao  historical ratios of ao to paid losses are developed  and then applied to the current outstanding reserves 
the method uses a traditional assumption that of the expenses are realized when the claim is open  and the other are incurred when the claim is closed 
the method also assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the property casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and lae patterns will continue into the future 
some of the factors that could influence assumptions arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
inflation changes have much less impact on short tail personal lines reserves and more impact on long tail commercial lines 
the company does not have any significant long tailed lines of business  so the actuarial assumptions and methodologies are consistent across all lines of business  regardless of the expected payout patterns 
this is further evidenced by the fact that approximately of ultimate losses for a given accident year are reported in the first year and by the end of the second year more than are reported 
reserves for policyholder benefits benefit reserves for traditional life products are determined according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the methodology used requires that the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums that portion of the gross premium required to provide for all future benefits and expenses be determined 
such determination uses assumptions  including provision for adverse deviation  for expected investment yields  mortality  terminations and maintenance expenses applicable at the time the insurance contracts are issued 
these assumptions determine the level and the sufficiency of reserves 
the company annually tests the validity of these assumptions 
benefit reserves for universal life type products and annuity products are determined according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this standard directs that  for policies with an explicit account balance  the benefit reserve is the account balance without reduction for any applicable surrender charge 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and the aicpa audit and accounting guide  credit insurance reserves are held as unearned premium reserves calculated using the rule of method 
reserves for supplementary contracts with life contingencies are determined using the individual annuity mortality table and an interest rate of 
likewise  reserves for accidental death benefits are determined predominantly by using the accidental death benefit mortality table and an interest rate of 
reserves for disability benefits  both active and disabled lives  are calculated primarily from the disability study and a rate of 
a small portion of the company s disabled life reserves are calculated based on the intercompany group disability study and a rate of 
reserves for all other benefits are computed in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards 
management believes that reserve amounts reflected in the company s balance sheet related to life products are consistently applied and fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles  are based on actuarial assumptions which are in accordance with contract provisions  make a good and sufficient provision for all unmatured obligations of the company guaranteed under the terms of its contracts  
table of contents 
index to financial statements are computed on the basis of assumptions consistent with those used in computing the corresponding items of the preceding year end  and include provision for all actuarial reserves and related items that ought to be established 
valuation of investments unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
fair values for fixed maturities are based on quoted market prices 
the cost of investment securities sold is determined by using the first in  first out methodology 
in some instances  the company may use the specific identification method 
the company monitors its investment portfolio and conducts quarterly reviews of investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
such evaluations involve judgment and consider the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term 
declines resulting from broad market conditions or industry related events  and for which the company has the intent to hold the investment for a period of time believed to be sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  are considered to be temporary 
future adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in an impairment charge in the future 
where a decline in fair value of an investment below its cost is deemed to be other than temporary  a charge is reflected in income for the difference between the cost or amortized cost and the estimated net realizable value 
as a result  writedowns of million and thousand were recorded in on equity securities and fixed maturities  respectively 
during  writedowns of million and million were recorded on equity securities and fixed maturities  respectively 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are directly related to the production of business have been deferred 
life insurance products traditional life insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium payment period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy benefit reserves 
acquisition costs for universal life type policies are being amortized over a thirty year period in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits that are determined based upon surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
investment income is considered  if necessary  in the determination of the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
property casualty products acquisition costs for property casualty insurance are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
future changes in estimates  such as the relative time certain employees spend in initial policy bookings  may require adjustment to the amounts deferred 
changes in underwriting and policy issuance processes may also give rise to changes in these deferred costs 
reserves for litigation the company is subject to lawsuits in the normal course of business related to its insurance and noninsurance products 
at the time a lawsuit becomes known  management evaluates the merits of the case and determines the need for establishing estimated reserves for potential settlements or judgments as well as reserves for potential costs of defending the company against the allegations of the complaint 
these reserves may be adjusted as the case develops 
periodically  and at least quarterly  management assesses all pending cases as a basis for evaluating reserve levels 
at that point  any necessary adjustments are made to applicable reserves as determined by management and are included in current operating results 
reserves may be adjusted based upon outside counsels advice regarding the law and facts of the case  any revisions in the law applicable to the case  the results of depositions and or other forms of discovery  general developments as the case progresses such as a favorable or an adverse trial court ruling  whether a verdict is rendered for or against the company  whether management believes an appeal will be successful  or other factors that may affect the anticipated outcome of the case 
management believes adequate reserves have been established in known cases 
however  due to the uncertainty of future events  there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will not differ from the assessments made by management

the overall yield rate  calculated using amortized cost  declined during to 
the company had net realized investment gains before income taxes of million in compared to realized investment gains of million during these gains are primarily from sales of equity securities 
such realized gains on sales of equity securities are the result of market conditions and therefore can fluctuate from period to period

the company considers bonds with a quality rating of bb and below to be below investment grade or high yield bonds also called junk bonds 
at december   approximately of fixed maturities were mortgage backed securities 
such securities are comprised of collateral mortgage obligations cmo s and pass through securities 
based on reviews of the company s portfolio of mortgage backed securities  the impact of prepayment risk on the company s financial position and results from operation is not believed to be significant 
these risks are discussed in more detail in item a of this form k 
at december   the company s total portfolio of fixed maturities had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
all securities with the exception of the investment noted above are priced by nationally recognized pricing services or by broker dealers securities firms 
during  the company sold million in fixed maturities available for sale 
these sales resulted in gross realized gains of million and gross realized losses of million 
during  the company sold million in fixed maturities available for sale 
these sales resulted in gross realized gains of thousand and gross realized losses of million 
the company monitors its level of investments in high yield fixed maturities and its level of equity investments in companies that issue high yield debt securities 
management believes the level of such investments is not significant to the company s financial condition 
at december   the company had unrealized gains in such investments of million compared to thousand at december  the company recognized a net loss of thousand on the disposal of high yield debt securities in after recognizing a net gain of thousand on similar disposals in it is the company s policy to write down securities for which declines in value have been deemed to be other than temporary 
the amount written down represents the difference between the cost or amortized cost and the fair value at the time of determining the security was impaired 
quarterly reviews are conducted by the company to ascertain which securities  if any  have become impaired in value 
investments in securities entail general market risk as well as company specific risk 
during  the company wrote down one bond issue totaling thousand and nine equity securities totaling million for which declines in value were deemed to be other than temporary 
during  the company wrote down three bond issues totaling million and five equity securities totaling million for which declines in value were deemed to be other than temporary 
there were no non performing bonds included in the portfolio at either december  or december  of the company s million in gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available for sale  million or are related to mortgage backed securities  million or to obligations of united states government corporations and agencies  million or to asset backed securities  million or to obligations of states and political subdivisions  thousand or to corporate securities and thousand or to united states treasury securities 
at december   unrealized losses of million existed on equity securities directly owned by the company 
of this amount  the greatest concentrations of gross unrealized losses were in the energy  information technology and healthcare sectors where the company had losses of million  thousand and thousand  respectively 
in assessing each security  the company analyzes the industry and earnings trends of the underlying issuer  the length of time the security has continuously been in a loss position  and the magnitude of the loss in comparison to its cost 
generally  the company writes down securities that  based on its review  appear to be other than temporarily impaired 
due to the subjectivity of the writedown process  there are risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s future earnings and financial position 
if recoveries in the price of securities fail to materialize  the company s earnings and financial position will be negatively impacted 
the company s investment philosophy is one that generally looks for long range growth based on the company s willingness and ability to hold investments for extended periods of time 
three equity securities had experienced a reduction of at least in value at the end of of these equity securities in loss positions  all had been written down to values no greater than thousand 
each had been in a loss position for greater than twelve months 
one fixed maturity with unrealized losses of thousand had experienced a reduction in value of at least at the end of and had been in a loss position for longer than three months but less than six months 
the company s general practice is to re evaluate any security written down on a periodic basis in order to determine whether additional impairment has occurred 
at december   the company held below investment grade fixed maturities with a cost of million and a fair value of million 
while these securities represent of both the cost and fair value of the company s total fixed maturity portfolio  only three of these investments were in an unrealized loss position 
additionally  at december   the company owned equity securities that have issued junk bonds with a cost of million and a fair value of million

inflation increases claims incurred by property casualty insurers as property repairs  replacements and medical expenses increase

since inflation has remained relatively low in recent years  financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources the company receives funds from its subsidiaries consisting of dividends  payments for funding federal income taxes  and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries 
these funds are used for paying dividends to stockholders  corporate interest and expenses  federal income taxes  and for funding additional investments in its subsidiaries operations 
the company s subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs  claims  other policy benefits  interest expense  general operating expenses  and dividends to the company 
the major sources of the subsidiaries liquidity are operations and cash provided by maturing or liquidated investments 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of readily marketable securities that can be sold for cash 
based on a review of the company s matching of asset and liability maturities and on the interest sensitivity of the majority of policies inforce  management believes the ultimate exposure to loss from interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
primary source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
such net positive cash flows provide the foundation of the company s assets liability management program and are the primary drivers of the company s liquidity 
as previously discussed  the company also maintains a diversified portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities that provide a secondary source of liquidity should net cash flows from operating activities prove inadequate to fund current operating needs 
management believes that such an eventuality is unlikely given the company s product mix primarily short duration personal lines property casualty products  its ability to adjust premium rates subject to regulatory oversight to reflect emerging loss and expense trends and its catastrophe reinsurance program  amongst other factors 
contractual obligations and commitments in evaluating current and potential financial performance of any corporation  investors often wish to view the contractual obligations and commitments of the entity 
the company has contractual obligations in the form of debt  benefit obligations to policyholders and leases 
leases have primarily been originated by its insurance subsidiaries and vision 
the company s contractual obligations at december  are summarized below payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases capital lease obligations partnership funding obligations commercial paper notes payable to affiliates long term debt interest on long term debt property casualty loss and loss adjustment expense reserves future life insurance obligations total contractual obligations long term debt is assumed to be settled at its contractual maturity 
interest on long term debt is calculated using interest rates in effect at december  for variable rate debt and is shown in the table through the maturity of the underlying debt 
interest on long term debt is accrued and settled monthly  thus the timing and amount of such payments may vary from the calculated value 
for additional information refer to note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property casualty loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
at december   total property casualty reserves in the above table of  are gross of salvage and subrogation recoverables of  future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of life s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations

credit risk assessment of credit risk is a critical factor in the company s consumer loan and commercial leasing subsidiary 
all credit decisions are made by personnel trained to limit loss exposure from unfavorable risks 
in attempting to manage risk  the company regularly reviews delinquent accounts and adjusts reserves for potential loan losses and potential lease losses 
to the extent these reserves are inadequate at the time an account is written off  income would be negatively impacted

reserves for property casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances  historical trends  emergence patterns and settlement patterns 
reserves for reported losses are established on a case by case basis with the amounts determined by claims adjusters based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based primarily on historical emergence patterns with consideration given to many variables including statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
the company s internal actuarial staff conducts annual reviews of projected loss development information by line of business to assist management in making estimates of reserves for ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses payable 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness is established in the context of claim severity  loss ratio and trend factors  all of which are implicit in the liability estimates 
the annual actuarial reviews are presented to management with a point estimate established within the range of probable outcomes for evaluating the adequacy of reserves and determination of the appropriate reserve value to be included in the financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements management establishes reserves using its best estimate determined using accepted actuarial techniques 
although management uses many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate reserves  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
management establishes reserves for loss adjustment expenses that are not attributable to a specific claim 
these reserves are referred to as defense and cost containment dcc and adjusting and other expenses ao 
dcc and ao reserves are recorded to establish the liability for settling and defending claims that have been incurred  but have not yet been completely settled 
for ao  historical ratios of ao to paid losses are developed  and then applied to the current outstanding reserves 
the method uses a traditional assumption that of the expenses are realized when the claim is open  and the other are incurred when the claim is closed 
the method also assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time

total losses and loss adjustment expenses payable increased million  or from december  to december  the reserve increase is primarily attributable to product level exposure changes 
the current year development of the prior years ultimate liability does not reflect any changes in the company s fundamental claims reserving practices or actuarial assumptions 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims

the non storm claims that were not adjusted and settled until had higher levels of activity  both number and amounts  than historical patterns indicated which resulted in an increase to incurred losses of million 
the increase in prior accident year development was the result of the non storm claims lag resulting from hurricane ivan 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections  which is often referred to as the standard deviation or error term  while the point estimates establish a mean  or expected value for the ultimate reserve 
management s best estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves considers the actuarial point estimate and expected variation to establish an appropriate position within the range 
based on a review of historical ultimate development patterns  management has estimated that one standard deviation from mid point for ultimate development has a favorable development opportunity and a unfavorable development opportunity 
the potential impact of loss reserve variability on net income is quantifiable using a standard deviation and carried reserve amounts listed above 
to the extent that ultimate development is favorable compared to expectation  the potential reserve decrease is million on a pretax basis 
likewise  if ultimate development is unfavorable compared to expectation  the reserve increase is thousand on a pretax basis 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the property casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and lae patterns will continue into the future 
some of the factors that could influence assumptions arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
inflation changes have much less impact on short tail personal lines reserves and more impact on long tail commercial lines 
the company does not have any significant long tailed lines of business  so the actuarial assumptions and methodologies are consistent across all lines of business  regardless of the expected payout patterns 
this is further evidenced by the fact that approximately of ultimate losses for a given accident year are reported in the first year and by the end of the second year more than are reported 
reinsurance property casualty ceded the property casualty subsidiaries of the company follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual subsidiary from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions  activities  or economic characteristics of the reinsurance to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurance insolvencies 
none of the reinsurance receivable amounts have been deemed to be uncollectible at december  each subsidiary is party to working cover reinsurance treaties for property casualty lines 
under the property per risk excess of loss treaty  each subsidiary is responsible for the first thousand of each covered loss  and the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over thousand of covered loss with a maximum recovery of million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the subsidiaries also make use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations

under this program  the company participates in only its pooled share of a lower catastrophe pool limit unless the losses exceed an upper catastrophe pool limit 
in cases where the upper catastrophe limit is exceeded on a basis  the company s share in the loss would be based upon its amount of statutory surplus relative to other members of the group as of the most recently filed annual statement 
lower and upper catastrophe pool limits are adjusted periodically due to increases in insured property risks

the amount retained on an individual life will vary depending upon age and mortality prospects of the risk 
at december   life had total insurance inforce of billion of which billion was ceded to other insurers 
in addition  reserve credits of million have been taken as a result of the ceding of these inforce amounts to other insurers 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the subsidiary from primary liability for the full amount of a policy claim  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded

geographic concentration the company s property casualty insurance business is generated in states  with the majority of the business generated in southeastern states  and its life insurance business is generated in states 
accordingly  unusually severe storms or other disasters in these states might have a more significant effect on the company than a more geographically diversified company and could have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
however  the company s catastrophe protection program  which began november   reduced the potential adverse impact and earnings volatility caused by such catastrophe exposures 
legal environment lawsuits brought by policyholders or third party claimants can create volatility in the company s earnings 
the company maintains in house legal staff and  as needed  secures the services of external legal firms to present and protect its position 
certain legal proceedings are in process at december  these proceedings involve alleged breaches of contract  torts  including bad faith and fraud claims  and miscellaneous other causes of action 
these lawsuits involve claims for unspecified amounts of compensatory damages  mental anguish damages and punitive damages 
costs for these and similar proceedings  including accruals for outstanding cases  are included in the financial statements of the company 
management periodically reviews reserves established to cover potential costs of litigation including legal fees and potential damage assessments and adjusts them based on their best estimates 
it should be noted that in mississippi and alabama  where the company has substantial business  the likelihood of a judgment in any given suit  including a large mental anguish and or punitive damage award by a jury  bearing little or no relation to actual damages  continues to exist  creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse financial results 
increased public interest in the availability and affordability of insurance has prompted legislative  regulatory and judicial activity in several states 
this includes efforts to contain insurance prices  restrict underwriting practices and risk classifications  mandate rate reductions and refunds  eliminate or reduce exemptions from antitrust laws and generally expand regulation 
because of alabama s low automobile rates as compared to rates in most other states  the company does not expect the type of punitive legislation and initiatives found in some states to be a factor in its primary market in the immediate future
