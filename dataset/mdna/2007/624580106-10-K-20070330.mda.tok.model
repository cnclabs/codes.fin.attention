item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and the forward looking statements contained in this form k should be read carefully in connection with evaluating movado group  inc s business 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated 
additional risks which the company does not presently consider material  or of which it is not currently aware  may also have an adverse impact on the business 
please also see forward looking statements on page the company faces intense competition in the worldwide watch industry 
the watch industry is highly competitive  and the company competes globally with numerous manufacturers  importers and distributors  some of which are larger and have greater financial  distribution  advertising and marketing resources 
the company s products compete on the basis of price  features  perceived desirability  reliability and perceived attractiveness 
the company also faces increased competition from internet based retailers 
the company s future results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other competitors 
maintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to the success of the company  and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
favorable brand recognition is an important factor to the future success of the company 
the company sells its products under a variety of owned and licensed brands 
factors affecting brand recognition are often outside the company s control  and the company s efforts to create or enhance favorable brand recognition  such as advertising campaigns  product design and anticipation of fashion trends  may not have their desired effects 
additionally  the company relies on its license partners to maintain favorable brand recognition of their respective parent brands  and the company often has no control over the brand management efforts of its license partners 
finally  although the company s independent distributors are subject to contractual requirements to protect the company s brands  it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
any decline in perceived favorable recognition of the company s owned or licensed brands could materially and adversely affect future results of operations and profitability 
if the company is unable to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner  sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
fashion trends and consumer demands and tastes often shift quickly 
the company attempts to monitor these trends in order to adapt its product offerings to suit customer demand 
there is a risk that the company will not properly perceive changes in trends or tastes  which may result in the failure to adapt the company s products accordingly 
in addition  new model designs are regularly introduced into the market for all brands to keep ahead of evolving fashion trends as well as to initiate new trends of their own 
there is risk that the public may not favor these new models or that the models may not be ready for sale until after the trend has passed 
if the company fails to respond to and keep up to date with fashion trends and consumer demands and tastes  its brand image  sales  profitability and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if the company misjudges the demand for its products  high inventory levels could adversely affect future operating results and profitability 
consumer demand for the company s products can affect inventory levels 
if consumer demand is lower than expected  inventory levels can rise causing a strain on operating cash flow 
if the inventory cannot be sold through the company s wholesale or retail outlets  additional reserves or write offs to future earnings could be necessary 
conversely  if consumer demand is higher than expected  insufficient inventory levels could result in unfulfilled customer orders  loss of revenue and an unfavorable impact on customer relationships 
failure to properly judge consumer demand and properly manage inventory could have a material adverse effect on profitability and liquidity 
an increase in product returns could negatively impact the company s operating results and profitability 
the company recognizes revenue as sales when merchandise is shipped and title transfers to the customer 
the company permits the return of damaged or defective products and accepts limited amounts of product returns in certain instances 
accordingly  the company provides allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
while such returns have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past 
any significant increase in product damages or defects and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
the company s business relies on the use of independent parties to manufacture its products 
any loss of an independent manufacturer  or the company s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner  could have an adverse effect on customer relations  brand image  net sales and results of operations 
the company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies primarily on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand 
all product sources must achieve and maintain the company s high quality standards and specifications 
the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet the company s high quality standards and specifications could cause the company to miss committed delivery dates with customers  which could result in cancellation of the customers orders 
in addition  delays in delivery of satisfactory products could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability  particularly if the delays cause the company to be unable to market certain products during the seasonal periods when its sales are typically higher 
see risk factors the company s business is seasonal  with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons  so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
a majority of the swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of movado  ebel  concord and esq watches are purchased from two suppliers 
additionally  the company does not have long term supply commitments with its manufacturers and thus competes for production facilities with other organizations  some of which are larger and have greater resources 
any loss of an independent manufacturer  or the company s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner  could have an adverse effect on customer relations  brand image  net sales and results of operations 
if the company loses any of its license agreements  there may be significant loss of revenues and a negative effect on business 
the company has the right to produce  market and distribute watches under the brand names of esq  coach  tommy hilfiger  hugo boss  juicy couture and  beginning in  lacoste pursuant to license agreements with the respective owners of those trademarks 
there are certain minimum royalty payments as well as other requirements associated with these agreements 
failure to meet any of these requirements could result in the loss of the license 
additionally  after the term of any license agreement has concluded  the licensor may decide not to renew with the company 
any loss of one or more of the company s licenses could result in loss of future revenues which could adversely affect its financial condition 
changes in the sales mix of the company s products could impact gross profit margins 
the individual brands that are sold by the company are sold at a wide range of price points and yield a variety of gross profit margins 
thus  the mix of sales by brand can have an impact on the gross profit margins of the company 
if the company s sales mix shifts unfavorably toward brands with lower gross profit margins than the company s historical consolidated gross profit margin or if the mix of business changes significantly in the movado boutiques  it could have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
the company s business is seasonal  with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons  so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s sales are seasonal by nature 
the company s us sales are traditionally greater during the christmas and holiday season 
internationally  major selling seasons center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
the amount of net sales and operating income generated during these seasons depends upon the general level of retail sales at such times  as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
if events or circumstances were to occur that negatively impact consumer spending during such holiday seasons  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales  profitability and results of operations 
if the economy faces a recessionary period  purchases of the company products may be adversely affected 
the company s products fall into categories that are considered discretionary items 
consumer purchases of discretionary items can change due to many economic and global factors 
declining confidence in the us or international economies  rising interest rates and taxation issues could adversely affect the level of available discretionary income for consumers to spend 
in addition  events such as war  terrorism  natural disasters or outbreaks of disease could further dampen consumer spending on discretionary items 
if any of these events should occur  the company s future sales could decline 
sales in the company s retail stores are dependent upon customer foot traffic 
the success of the company s retail stores is  to a certain extent  dependent upon the amount of customer foot traffic generated by the mall or outlet center in which those stores are located 
the majority of the company s movado boutiques are located in upscale regional shopping centers throughout the united states  while the company s outlet stores are located primarily near vacation destinations 
factors that can affect customer foot traffic include the location of the mall  the location of the company s store within the mall  the other tenants in the mall  the occupancy rate of the mall  the success of mall and tenant advertising to attract customers  increased competition in areas surrounding the mall  and increased competition from shopping over the internet and other alternatives such as mail order 
additionally  since a number of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations  factors that affect travel could decrease mall traffic 
such factors include the price and supply of fuel  travel concerns and restrictions  international instability  terrorism and inclement weather 
a reduction in foot traffic in relevant malls or shopping centers could have a material adverse effect on retail sales and profitability 
if the company is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business  its future operating results could suffer 
there are certain risks involved as the company continues expanding its business through acquisitions  license agreements  joint ventures and new initiatives such as the growing movado boutique business 
there is risk involved with each of these 
acquisitions and new license agreements require the company to ensure that new brands will successfully complement the other brands in its portfolio 
the company assumes the risk that the new brand will not be viewed by the public as favorably as its other brands 
in addition  the integration of an acquired company or licensed brand into the company s existing business can strain the company s current infrastructure with the additional work required and there can be no assurance that the integration of acquisitions or licensed brands will be successful or that acquisitions or licensed brands will generate sales increases 
the company needs to ensure it has the proper manpower and systems in place to allow for successful assimilation of new businesses 
the risk involved in growing the movado boutique business is that the company will not be able to successfully implement its business model 
in addition  the costs associated with leasehold improvements to current boutiques and the costs associated with opening new boutiques could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the inability to successfully implement its growth strategies could adversely affect the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the loss or infringement of the company s trademarks could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company believes that its trademarks are vital to the competitiveness and success of its business and therefore it takes all appropriate actions to register and protect them 
there can be no assurance  however  that such actions will be adequate to prevent imitation of the company s products or infringement of its trademarks or that others will not challenge the company s rights in  or its ownership of certain trademarks  or that such trademarks will be successfully defended 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  including some in which the company sells its products  may not protect these trademark rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  which could make it more difficult to successfully defend such challenges to them 
the company s inability to obtain or maintain rights in its trademarks could have an adverse effect on brand image and future results of operations 
pricing fluctuations of commodities could adversely affect the company s ability to produce product at favorable prices 
some of the company s higher end watch offerings are made with materials such as diamonds  precious metals and gold 
the company s proprietary jewelry is manufactured with silver  gold and platinum  semi precious and precious stones  and diamonds 
a significant change in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect the company s business by reducing gross profit margins  forcing an increase in suggested retail prices  which could lead to decreasing consumer demand  which could lead to higher inventory levels 
any and all of the above events could adversely affect the company s future cash flow and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of the company s inventory purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company operates under a hedging program which utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options to mitigate foreign currency risk 
if these hedge instruments are unsuccessful at minimizing the risk or are deemed ineffective  any fluctuation of the swiss franc exchange rate could impact the future results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect relative prices at which the company and its foreign competitors sell products in the same market 
a portion of the company s net sales are derived from international subsidiaries and are denominated in canadian dollars  swiss francs  euros  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  japanese yen and british pounds 
future revenues derived in these currencies could be affected by currency fluctuations 
the grinberg family owns a majority of the voting power of the company s stock 
each share of common stock of the company is entitled to one vote per share while each share of class a common stock of the company is entitled to ten votes per share 
while the members of the grinberg family do not own a majority of the company s outstanding common stock  by their significant holdings of class a common stock they control a majority of the voting power represented by all outstanding shares of both classes of stock 
consequently  the grinberg family is in a position to significantly influence any matters that are brought to a vote of the shareholders including  but not limited to  the election of the board of directors and approving any action requiring the approval of shareholders  including any amendments to the company s certificate of incorporation  mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of the company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the grinberg family 
these transactions might include proxy contests  tender offers  mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for shares of the company s common stock 
the company s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline due to changes in revenue  operating results and cash flow 
the company s revenue  results of operations and cash flow can be affected by several factors  some of which are not within its control 
those factors include  but are not limited to  those described as risk factors in this item a and under forward looking statements on page any or all of these factors could cause a decline in revenues or increased expenses  both of which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
if the company s earnings failed to meet the expectations of the public in any given period  the company s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline 
if the company were to lose its relationship with any of its key customers or distributors or any of such customers or distributors were to experience financial difficulties  there may be a significant loss of revenue and operating results 
the company s customer base covers a wide range of distribution including national jewelry store chains  department stores  independent regional jewelers  licensed partner retail stores and a network of distributors in many countries throughout the world 
the company does not have long term purchase contracts with its customers  nor does it have a significant backlog of unfilled orders 
customer purchasing decisions could vary with each selling season 
a material change in the company s customers purchasing decisions could have an adverse effect on its revenue and operating results 
the company extends credit to its customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition usually without requiring collateral 
should any of the company s larger customers experience financial difficulties  it could result in the company s curtailing doing business with them or an increase in its exposure related to its accounts receivable 
the inability to collect on these receivables could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company s wholesale business could be negatively affected by changes of ownership and consolidation in the retail industry 
a large portion of the company s us wholesale business is derived from major jewelry store chains and department stores 
in recent years  the retail industry has experienced changes in ownership and consolidations  none of which has had a material effect on the company s wholesale business 
future reorganizations  changes of ownership and consolidations could reduce the number of retail doors in which the company s products are sold and could increase the concentration of sales for any customers involved in such transactions 
future changes of ownership and structure in the retail industry may have a material adverse effect on the company s wholesale business 
if the company were to lose key members of management or be unable to attract and retain the talent required for the business  operating results could suffer 
the company s ability to execute key operating initiatives as well as to deliver product and marketing concepts appealing to target consumers depends largely on the efforts and abilities of key executives and senior management s competencies 
the unexpected loss of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the future business 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the talent and skills needed in the future 
if the company were unable to maintain existing space or to lease new space for its retail stores in prime mall locations or be unable to complete construction on a timely basis  the company s ability to achieve profitable results in the retail business could be adversely affected 
the company s strategy to create a movado lifestyle image and build retail presence with product assortments that complement successful wholesale watch distribution is a key element in the company s future movado boutique business plan 
the company s outlet stores are multi branded and serve solely as an effective vehicle to sell discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the company s watches  jewelry  tabletop and accessory products 
the company s boutiques and outlet stores are strategically located  respectively  in top malls throughout the united states and outlet centers located primarily near vacation destinations 
if the company could not maintain and secure locations in the prime malls and outlet centers for both the movado boutiques and outlet businesses  it could jeopardize the operations of the stores and business plans for the future 
additionally  if the company could not complete construction in new stores within the planned timeframes  cost overruns and lost revenue could adversely affect the profitability of the retail segment 
if the company could not secure financing and credit with favorable terms  the company could suffer high borrowing costs which could impact financial results 
the company has been able to secure financing and credit facilities with very favorable terms due to the company s financial stability and good relationships with its lending partners 
if conditions were to change such that the company was unable to comply with any of the covenants in its lending agreements or if relationships were to deteriorate  borrowing rates could increase and have an adverse effect on financial results 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states 
many factors affecting business activities outside the united states could adversely impact this business 
the company produces all of its watches and a portion of its proprietary jewelry outside the united states and primarily in europe and asia 
the company also generates approximately of its revenue from international sources 
factors that could affect the business activity vary by region and market and generally include without limitation changes in social  political and or economic conditions that could disrupt the trade activity in the countries where the company s manufacturers  suppliers and customers are located  the imposition of additional duties  taxes and other charges on imports and exports  changes in foreign laws and regulations  the adoption or expansion of trade sanctions  and a significant change in currency valuation in specific countries or markets 
the occurrence or consequences of any of these risks could affect the company s ability to operate in the affected regions 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general sales 
the company operates and manages its business in two principal business segments wholesale and retail 
the company also operates in two geographic segments united states and international 
the company divides its watch brands into three distinct categories luxury  accessible luxury and licensed brands 
the luxury category consists of the ebel and concord brands 
the accessible luxury category consists of the movado and esq brands 
the licensed brands category represents brands distributed under license agreements and includes coach  hugo boss  juicy couture and tommy hilfiger 
the primary factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s us and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures and product pricing decisions 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales made in those markets are affected by foreign exchange rates 
the company s international sales are billed in local currencies predominantly euros and swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
with the acquisition of ebel in march of  the introduction of hugo boss watches and the launch of lacoste watches in  the company expects that a higher percentage of its total sales will be derived from international markets in the future 
the company s business is seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
the company s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of the fiscal year 
the second half of the fiscal year ended january  accounted for of the company s net sales 
the company s retail operations consist of movado boutiques and outlet stores located throughout the united states 
the company does not have any retail operations outside of the united states 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence us wholesale sales 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist seasons associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors brand and product sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins for the company may not be comparable to those of other companies  since some companies include all the costs related to its distribution network in cost of sales whereas the company does not include the costs associated with its us warehousing and distribution facility nor the occupancy costs for the retail segment in the cost of sales line item 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
watches in the luxury category generally earn lower gross margin percentages than watches in the accessible luxury category 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower selling prices 
gross margins in the movado boutiques are affected by the mix of product sold 
the margins from the sale of watches are greater than those from the sale of jewelry and accessories 
gross margins from the sale of watches in the movado boutiques also exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns margins from manufacture to point of sale to the consumer 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
costs of sales of the company s products consist primarily of component costs  assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in switzerland and asia 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and asia and assembly in switzerland 
through productivity improvement efforts  the company has controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s cost of goods sold and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program had the effect of minimizing the exchange rate impact on product costs and gross margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the company s sg a expenses consist primarily of marketing  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual marketing expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  sales force travel and related expenses  expenses associated with baselworld  the annual watch and jewelry trade show and other industry trade shows and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary with overall sales levels 
retail selling expenses consist primarily of payroll related and store occupancy costs 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  rental and other occupancy costs  security  depreciation and amortization of furniture and leasehold improvements and shipping supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee compensation  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs  professional fees  bad debts  depreciation and amortization of furniture and leasehold improvements  patent and trademark expenses and various other general corporate expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and those significant policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and the application of certain critical accounting policies require management to make judgments based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to sales discounts and markdowns  product returns  bad debt  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience  contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in the wholesale segment  the company recognizes its revenues upon transfer of title and risk of loss in accordance with its fob shipping point terms of sale and after the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the retail segment  transfer of title and risk of loss occurs at the time of register receipt 
the company records estimates for sales returns  volume based programs and sales and cash discount allowances as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the sales are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  assessments of collectibility based on historic trends  the financial condition of the company s customers and an evaluation of economic conditions 
during fiscal  as a result of a change in these estimates  the company recorded a charge to allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
in general  while the actual bad debt losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates in the future 
as of january   the company knew of no situations with any of the company s major customers which would indicate the customer s inability to make their required payments 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company s us inventory is valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of finished goods and component inventories  held by international subsidiaries  are determined using average cost 
the company s management regularly reviews its sales to customers and customers sell through at retail to evaluate the adequacy of inventory reserves 
inventory with less than acceptable turn rates is classified as discontinued and  together with the related component parts which can be assembled into saleable finished goods  is sold primarily through the company s outlet stores 
when management determines that finished product is unsaleable or that it is impractical to build the remaining components into watches for sale  a reserve is established for the cost of those products and components to value the inventory at lower of cost or market 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements depending on future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions which may differ from the company s expectations 
long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable and an impairment write down is necessary 
the company performs an impairment review  at a minimum  on an annual basis 
however  the company will review its long lived assets for impairment once events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

when such a determination has been made  management compares the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized during that period 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the long lived assets 
during fiscal and  the company performed the reviews  which resulted in no impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the carrying value of its long lived assets in the movado boutique located in the soho section of new york city  might not be recoverable 
the impairment review was performed pursuant to sfas no 
because of an economic downturn affecting the soho boutique operations and revenue forecasts 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash pretax impairment charge of million consisting of property  plant and equipment of million and other assets of million 
the entire impairment charge is included in the selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal consolidated statements of income 
warranties all watches sold by the company come with limited warranties covering the movement against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase  with the exception of tommy hilfiger watches  for which the warranty period is ten years 
in addition  the warranty period is five years for the gold plating on certain movado watch cases and bracelets 
the company records an estimate for future warranty costs based on historical repair costs 
warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established 
if such costs were to substantially exceed estimates  this could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
stock based compensation on february   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  electing to use the modified prospective application transition method  and accordingly  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  the fair value of all stock options granted after adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards must be recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of each option at the grant date which requires certain assumptions be made 
the expected life of stock option grants is determined using historical data and represents the time period which the stock option is expected to be outstanding until it is exercised 
the risk free interest rate is the yield on the grant date of us treasury constant maturities with a maturity date closest to the expected life of the stock option 
the expected stock price volatility is derived from historical volatility and calculated based on the estimated term structure of the stock option grant 
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the expected annualized dividend which remains constant during the expected term of the option 
income taxes the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax laws and tax rates in each jurisdiction where the company operates  and applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  the amounts of any future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the company calculates estimated income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes
