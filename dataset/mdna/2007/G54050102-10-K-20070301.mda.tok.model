table of contents business environment economic and market conditions  particularly global m a activity  can significantly affect our financial performance 
lazard operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for lazard s management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can lazard assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see the section entitled risk factors in this form k 
net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory activity in the global m a industry for the year ended december  increased significantly for global completed and announced m a transactions  as evidenced by the following industry statistics regarding the volume of transactions year ended december  incr decr in billions completed m a transactions global trans atlantic announced m a transactions global trans atlantic source thomson financial as of january  lazard believes that its financial advisory business should continue to benefit from any sustained increase in m a volume 
activity in financial restructing declined significantly in  with the amount of corporate debt defaults  according to moody s investors service  inc  at billion in versus billion in  with the default rate in being at the lowest level in ten years 
asset management as shown in the table below  global market indices at december  increased as compared to such indices at december   largely as a result of strong performance in the fourth quarter of percentage change december  vs

table of contents key financial measures and indicators net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue is earned from the successful completion of mergers  acquisitions  restructurings  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main driver of financial advisory net revenue is overall m a  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction 
lazard s financial advisory segment also earns revenue from public and private securities offerings in conjunction with activities of its former capital markets and other segment 
in general  such fees are shared equally with its former capital markets and other segments 
as a result of the consummation of the equity public offering  lazard now has an arrangement with lfcm holdings under which the separated capital markets business will continue to distribute securities in public offerings originated by lazard s financial advisory business in a manner similar to its practice prior to the equity public offering 
lazard s asset management segment includes lazard asset management llc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as lam  lfg and merchant banking operations 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to institutional and private clients 
the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level of aum  which is influenced in large part by lazard s investment performance and by lazard s ability to successfully attract and retain assets  as well as the broader performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
in addition  as lazard s aum include significant assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to us currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investments such as hedge funds and merchant banking products  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
lazard also earns performance based incentive fees on some investment products  such as hedge funds  merchant banking funds and other investment products 
incentive fees on hedge funds are typically calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation during a fiscal period and can be subject to loss carry forward provisions in which losses incurred in the current period are applied against future period net appreciation 
incentive fees on merchant banking funds also may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits from merchant banking investments exceed a specified threshold 
incentive fees earned for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  demonstrate the volatility that incentive fees may have on total net revenue 
corporate net revenue consists primarily of investment income generated from long term investments  including principal investments that lazard has made in merchant banking and alternative investment funds managed by the asset management segment  net interest income generated by lfb  interest income related to cash and interest expense related to outstanding borrowings 
as a result of the consummation of the equity public offering  interest expense related to the financing transactions is included in corporate net revenue 
corporate net revenue can fluctuate due to fair value adjustments relating to long term investments  changes in interest rates and in interest rate spreads earned by lfb and changes in the levels of lazard s cash  long term investments and indebtedness 
in addition  for the year ended december   corporate net revenue includes a gain of approximately million  excluding transaction and other costs  relating to the termination of its strategic alliance the strategic alliance with intesa with such gain  after transaction and other costs  increasing operating income by approximately million 
although corporate net revenue during the year ended december  represented of lazard s net revenue  total assets in this segment represented of lazard s consolidated total assets as of december   principally attributable to the relatively significant amounts of assets associated with lfb  and  to a lesser extent  cash and long term investment balances 

table of contents lazard expects to experience significant fluctuations in net revenue and operating income during the course of any given year 
these fluctuations arise because a significant portion of financial advisory net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  financial restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
asset management net revenue is also subject to periodic fluctuations 
asset management fees are generally based on aum measured as of the end of a quarter or month  and an increase or reduction in aum at such dates  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  net client asset flows or otherwise  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
in addition  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not recorded until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
for most of our funds that determination is made at year end  and therefore such incentive fees are recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits 
as a limited liability company  prior to the consummation of the equity public offering on may  payments for services rendered by the majority of lazard s managing directors were accounted for as distributions of members capital 
in addition  subsequent to january   payments for services rendered by managing directors of lam and employee members of lam were accounted for as minority interest in net income 
see minority interest 
for periods subsequent to the consummation of the equity public offering  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors  including the managing directors of lam and distributions to profit participation members  in compensation and benefits expense 
as a result  lazard s compensation and benefits expense and operating income for the year ended december  includes all such payments  while compensation and benefits expense and operating income for the years ended december  and did not include those payments for services rendered by lazard s managing directors prior to may  the balance of lazard s operating expenses is referred to below as non compensation expense  which includes costs for premises and occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  communications and information services  equipment  depreciation and amortization and other expenses 
in and  non compensation expense also includes a provision pursuant to a tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings 
the operating expenses set forth in consolidated results of operations includes the costs lazard incurred as a result of the equity public offering after may  lazard has incurred additional expenses for  among other things  directors fees  sec reporting and compliance  insurance  investor relations  legal  accounting and other costs associated with being a public company 
provision for income taxes lazard has historically operated in the us as a limited liability company that was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  lazard has not been subject to us federal income taxes 
taxes related to income earned by partnerships represent obligations of the individual partners 
outside the us  lazard historically has operated principally through corporations and has been subject to local income taxes 
income taxes shown on lazard s consolidated statements of income for periods prior to may  are attributable to taxes incurred in non us entities and to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt attributable to lazard s operations apportioned to new york city 
following the equity public offering  lazard group is continuing to operate in the us as a limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and remains subject to local income taxes outside the us and to ubt 
in addition  lazard ltd s corporate subsidiaries are subject to additional income taxes  which taxes are reflected in its consolidated statements of income 

table of contents minority interest minority interest consists of a number of components 
as described below  amounts recorded as minority interest for periods prior to may  are not comparable to amounts recorded as minority interest for periods commencing may  commencing may   the company began recording a charge to minority interest in net income relating to laz md holdings ownership interest in lazard group  which approximated and at december  and december   respectively  with such expense amounting to million and million for the year ended december  and for the period may  through december   respectively 
on january   lazard group contributed net assets relating to the majority of its asset management business to form lam  an indirect subsidiary of lazard group 
upon formation of lam  certain members of lazard group including all the managing directors of lam at the time who provide services to lam contributed capital to lam and ceased being members of lazard group 
following the formation of lam  these capital interests have been included in minority interest on lazard group s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in connection with this contribution  lam managing directors and other key lam employees were granted equity units in lam 
commencing in  payments for services rendered by these individuals were accounted for as minority interest in net income in lazard group s consolidated statements of income 
the substantial majority of such payments related to services rendered by lam managing directors  which  in prior years  had been accounted for as distributions to members  and therefore  was not reported in prior years consolidated statements of income 
the remainder of such payments  which related to compensation of employee members of lam  was recorded as compensation and benefits expense in prior years consolidated statements of income 
as a result of the consummation of the equity public offering  and as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commencing may  the company no longer recognizes payments for services rendered by the managing directors of lam and employee members of lam as charges to minority interest 
effective may   those charges are now included in compensation and benefits expense 
the lam equity units entitle holders to payments in connection with selected fundamental transactions affecting lazard group or lam  including a dissolution or sale of all  or substantially all  of the assets of lazard group or lam  a merger of  or sale of  all of the interests in lam whereby lazard group ceases to own a majority of lam or have the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of lam  or a non ordinary course sale of assets by lam that exceeds million in value 
as a general matter  in connection with a fundamental transaction that triggers the lam equity units  following the completion of such transactions the holders of the lam equity units would be entitled in the aggregate  as of both december  and  to approximately of the net proceeds or imputed valuation of lam in such transaction after deductions for payment of creditors of lam and the return of lam capital 
as of december  and  lam s capital for these purposes totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million was owned by lam managing directors and employee members  with the remainder owned by lazard group 
these lam equity units are not entitled to share in the operating results of lam 
a separate class of interests in lam  which we refer to as lam profit units  is entitled to the ordinary profit and losses of lam  all of which are owned by lazard group 
accordingly  in the absence of a fundamental transaction that triggers the lam equity units  all of lam s net income is allocable to lazard group 
we have no current intention to cause or otherwise trigger a fundamental transaction that would give rise to payment obligations to the holders of interests in lam 
the board of directors of lam  a majority of which is appointed by lazard group  may  in its discretion  grant lam equity interests that include profit rights to managing directors of  and other persons providing services to  lam  as a portion of their ongoing compensation 
if granted  these equity interests would be subject to specified vesting conditions 
no such lam equity interests have been granted as of december  nor is there any present intention to do so 
also included in minority interest in our consolidated financial statements are minority interests in various lam related general partnerships held directly by certain of our lam managing directors 

table of contents in september  lazard group and banca intesa spa intesa announced their agreement to form the strategic alliance 
under the terms of the strategic alliance  intesa became a partner in lazard group s business interests in italy in january  as a result  commencing in  lazard group recorded minority interest to reflect intesa s economic interest in the strategic alliance 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on may  lazard group  lazard co 
srl lazard italy  an indirect subsidiary of lazard group  and intesa completed the termination of the strategic alliance 
accordingly  as a result of the termination  lazard group now owns of lazard italy  and therefore no longer records minority interest relating to intesa s formerly owned interest in lazard italy 
as of december   in accordance with the adoption of financial interpretation no 
r for consolidation of certain variable interest entities fin r  referred to as vies  lazard group consolidated certain vies in which it held a variable interest and where lazard group was the primary beneficiary 
those vies include lazard group sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with our compensation plans 
accordingly  lazard group s consolidated financial statements at december  and for the year then ended reflect minority interests associated with these vies 
these vies were included with the separated businesses and  as such  are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements following may to the extent that we expand our merchant banking activities in the future  we expect that we may be required to consolidate additional vies related to such activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the components of the company s minority interest 
discontinued operations as described above  in connection with the separation lazard group transferred the capital markets and other segment to lfcm holdings as of may  capital markets and other net revenue largely consisted of primary revenue earned from underwriting fees from securities offerings and secondary revenue earned in the form of commissions and trading profits from principal transactions in lazard group s equity  fixed income and convertibles businesses and underwriting and other fee revenue from corporate broking in the uk lazard group also earned fund management fees and  if applicable  carried interest incentive fees related to merchant banking funds managed as part of this former segment 
such carried interest incentive fees were earned if profits from merchant banking investments exceeded a specified threshold 
in addition  this former segment generated investment income and net interest income principally from long term investments  cash balances and securities financing transactions 
net income net income allocable to members of lazard group prior to may  prior to the equity public offering  payments for services rendered by lazard group s managing directors were accounted for as distributions from members capital  or as minority interest in net income in the case of payments to lam managing directors and certain key lam employee members  rather than as compensation and benefits expense 
as a result  prior to may  lazard group s compensation and benefits expense and net income allocable to members  did not reflect most payments for services rendered by its managing directors 
following the consummation of the equity public offering and financing transactions  the company includes all payments for services rendered by its managing directors in compensation and benefits expense 
the table below illustrates what our compensation and benefits expense would have been on an adjusted basis for the years ended december  and had the portion of distributions to members which represent payments for services rendered and our minority interest in net income related to lam been accounted for as compensation and benefits expense  as well as the actual amounts in the year ended december  the table further illustrates the relationship between our adjusted compensation and benefits expense and our operating revenue 
we define operating revenue to equal consolidated total gross revenue less i revenue related to the consolidation of lam general partnerships and ii interest expense related to lfb  our paris based banking affiliate 
we deduct general partnership revenue because we do not deem such revenue to be operating in nature as it is directly offset by a charge to minority interest in net income for the same 
table of contents amount 
the interest expense incurred by lfb is also excluded from our definition of operating revenue because lfb is a commercial bank and we consider its interest expense to be a cost directly related to the conduct of its business 
the remaining interest expense  however  relates to our decisions regarding the capital structure of lazard as a whole 
year ended december  in thousands adjusted compensation and benefits historical add portion of distributions representing payments for services rendered by managing directors excluding lam managing directors portion of distributions representing payments included in minority interest for services rendered by lam managing directors and employee members of lam adjusted compensation and benefits operating revenue historical total revenue deduct lfb interest expense revenue related to consolidation of lam general partnerships operating revenue adjusted compensation expense to operating revenue ratio our policy is that our compensation and benefits expense will not exceed of operating revenue each year  including that payable to our managing directors and amortization of restricted stock unit grants under our equity incentive plan which starts at the date of grant see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in and  the new compensation arrangements were in effect  and our compensation expense to operating revenue ratio was and  respectively 
we achieved this target ratio in and while continuing to maintain financial packages for our managing directors that we believe are competitive in the market place 
while we have implemented such steps that we believe will maintain our ongoing compensation expense to operating revenue ratio to the target level of  there can be no guarantee that this will continue to be achieved or that our policy will not change in the future 
increased competition for senior professionals  changes in the financial markets generally or other factors could prevent us from sustaining this objective 
consolidated results of operations lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of our non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members or stockholders equity 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of income 
results of operations are reported as an historical partnership until the equity public offering on may  and do not include payments for services rendered by managing directors as compensation expense and a provision for us federal income taxes 
such payments and tax provisions are included in subsequent periods 
therefore  results for periods prior to the equity public offering on may  and subsequent thereto are not comparable

net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and financial restructuring generally are correlated to the volume of completed industry wide mergers and acquisitions activity and restructurings occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  material variances in the level of mergers and acquisitions activity in a particular geography where lazard has significant market share or the number of its advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions can cause its results to diverge from industry wide activity 
certain lazard client statistics and global industry statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients total with fees greater than million percentage of total financial advisory revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed greater than billion b a there were no individual clients that constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source thomson financial as of january  
table of contents the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms 
the offices that generate financial advisory net revenue are located in north america  europe principally in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world principally in asia 
year ended december  north america europe rest of world total the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on both mergers and acquisitions and financial restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professional staff with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings

cash flows the company s cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of financial advisory and asset management fees  the timing of distributions to shareholders and payment of incentive compensation bonuses to managing directors and employees 
the m a and asset management fee receivable collection 
table of contents periods generally are days or less 
however  the collection time for restructuring transactions may extend beyond days  particularly those that involve bankruptcies due to issues such as court ordered holdbacks 
in addition  fee receivables from our private fund advisory activities are generally collected over a four year period 
lazard group traditionally makes payments for employee incentive compensation and distributions to members primarily in the first four months of the year with respect to the prior year s results

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations  with a traditional seasonal pattern of cash flow 
while employee salaries are paid throughout the year  annual incentive compensation has historically been paid to employees in the early months following year end 
the company s managing directors are paid a salary during the year  but a majority of their annual cash distributions with respect to the prior year have historically been paid to them in three monthly installments in february  march and april following year end 
in addition  and to a lesser extent  during the year we pay certain tax advances on behalf of our managing directors  and these advances serve to reduce the amounts due to the managing directors in the three installments described above 
as a consequence  our level of cash on hand generally decreases significantly during the first four months of the year and gradually builds up over the remainder of the year 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency  ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted  that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members equity stockholders deficiency 
such currency translation adjustments served to increase decrease members equity stockholders deficiency by approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included on the consolidated statements of income 
we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash levels  credit lines  principal investment commitments  interest and principal payments on debt  capital expenditures and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements 
we maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements 
as of december   lazard had approximately million in unused lines of credit available to it  including million of unused lines of credit available to lfb 
lazard s annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations 
we believe that our cash flows from operating activities  including use of our credit lines as needed  should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next months and beyond 
as noted above  we intend to maintain lines of credit that can be utilized should the need arise 
concurrent with the equity public offering  lazard group entered into a five year  million senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders  with such revolving credit facility being amended on may  to provide for aggregate commitments of million 
as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
the senior revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type 
in addition  the senior revolving credit facility  among other things  limits the ability of the borrower to incur debt  grant liens  pay dividends  enter into mergers or to sell all or substantially all of its assets and contains financial covenants that must be maintained 
we may  to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements  use other financing sources in addition to any new credit facilities 
over the past several years  lazard has entered into several financing agreements designed to strengthen both its capital base and liquidity  the most significant of which are described below 
each of these agreements is discussed in more detail in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
in  the company issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock class c preferred interests for an aggregate amount of million 
the class c preferred interests were subject to mandatory redemption by the company in march and  prior to such date  were redeemable in whole or in part  at the company s option 
the class c preferred interests were entitled to receive distributions out of the profits of the company at a rate of 
table of contents per annum  which distributions were required to be paid prior to any distributions of profits to holders of any other existing class of interests in the company 
the class c preferred interests were redeemed in may as part of the recapitalization transactions 
interest on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the credit in represents accrued dividends which were cancelled in connection with the redemption of membership interests of historical partners

lazard group paid intesa an amount equal to a annualized return on intesa s ownership interest from april  through the termination closing and the accrued and unpaid interest on the million subordinated promissory note as of the termination closing 
as a result of the termination of the strategic alliance with intesa and lazard group s repurchase of intesa s ownership interest  the company realized a gain of approximately million  excluding transaction and other costs  which is included in revenue other on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  with all of such gain being recorded in the second quarter of and  after transaction and other costs  resulted in an increase in operating income of approximately million

net revenue and operating income historically have fluctuated significantly between quarters 
this variability arises from the fact that transaction completion fees comprise the majority of our net revenue  with the billing and recognition of such fees being dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
in addition  incentive fees earned on aum and compensation related thereto are generally not recorded until the end of the applicable measurement period  which is generally the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined

effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect lazard expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see risk factors risks related to our business difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
lazard s clients generally enter into agreements with lazard that vary in duration depending on the nature of the service provided 
lazard typically bills clients for the full amounts due under the applicable agreements on or after the dates on which the specified service has been provided 
generally  payments are collected within days of billing or over longer periods of time with respect to billings related to restructurings and our private fund advisory activities 
the company also earns performance based incentive fees on some investment products  such as hedge funds and merchant banking funds 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are recorded at the end of the year  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined  and typically are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation during the year 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carry forward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
lazard assesses whether collection is probable based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and an assessment of the client s current creditworthiness 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
in rare cases  an allowance for doubtful accounts may be established  for example  if a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  lazard is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process requires lazard to estimate its actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains on long term investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within lazard s consolidated statements of financial condition 
lazard must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not more likely than not  lazard must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million  with such amount offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the book versus tax basis differences and certain net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  when necessary  valuation allowances are established 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the company in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or lazard adjusts these estimates in future periods  lazard may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact lazard s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  in order to determine its quarterly tax rate  lazard is required to estimate full year pre tax income and the related annual income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
tax exposures can involve complex 
table of contents issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect lazard s overall effective tax rate 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
furthermore  lazard s interpretation of complex tax laws may impact its measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
valuation of investments long term investments consist principally of investments in merchant banking and alternative investment funds  and other privately managed investments 
these investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition  with unrealized gains and losses reflected net on the consolidated statements of income 
gains and losses on long term investments  which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments  are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income net income allocable to members of lazard group prior to may  
where applicable  the fair value of a publicly traded investment is determined by quoted market prices 
most of the company s investments included in long term investments  however  are not publicly traded and  as a result  are valued based upon management s best estimate 
the fair value of such investments is based upon an analysis of the investee s financial results  condition  cash flows and prospects 
the carrying value of such investments is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable  generally as evidenced by third party transactions or transactions that directly affect the value of such investments 
adjustments also are made  in the absence of third party transactions  if lazard determines that the expected realizable value of the investment differs from its carrying value 
in reaching that determination  lazard considers many factors  including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the investee  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
the company s investments in partnership interests  including general partnership and limited partnership interests in real estate funds  are recorded at fair value based on changes in the fair value of the partnerships underlying net assets 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of investments that are not readily marketable  estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for such investments existed 
lazard seeks to maintain the necessary resources  with the appropriate experience and training  to ensure that control and independent price verification functions are adequately performed 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  lazard makes estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model 
lazard uses its best judgment and information available to it at the time to perform this review 
because lazard s assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
consolidation of vies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and all other entities in which we are the primary beneficiary or control 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to

voting interest entities are consolidated in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended by sfas no 
 consolidated financial statements 
arb no 
states that the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in an entity is ownership of a majority voting interest 
sfas no 
amends arb no 
to require consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries unless control is temporary or does not rest with the majority owner 
sfas no 
also requires consolidation of a majority owned subsidiary even if it has non homogeneous operations  a large minority interest  or a foreign location 
accordingly  lazard consolidates voting interest entities in which it has the majority of the voting interest in accordance with arb no 
and sfas no 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
a controlling financial interest in a vie is present when an enterprise has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests  that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both 
the enterprise with a controlling financial interest  known as the primary beneficiary  consolidates the vie 
lazard determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie by first performing a qualitative analysis of the vie that includes  among other factors  its capital structure  contractual terms  and related party relationships 
where qualitative analysis is not conclusive  lazard performs a quantitative analysis 
for purposes of allocating a vie s expected losses and expected residual returns to the vie s variable interest holders  lazard calculates its share of the vie s expected losses and expected residual returns using a cash flows model that allocates those expected losses and residual returns to it  based on contractual arrangements and or lazard s position in the capital structure of the vie under various scenarios 
lazard would reconsider its assessment of whether it is the primary beneficiary if there are changes to any of the variables used in determining the primary beneficiary 
those variables may include changes to financial arrangements  contractual terms  capital structure and related party relationships 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie are included in the consolidated financial statements of lazard if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
any third party interest in these consolidated entities is reflected as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard was the primary beneficiary were consolidated at december  in accordance with fin r 
those vies included company sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with lazard s compensation plans 
in connection with the separation  lazard group transferred its general partnership interests in those vies to a subsidiary of lfcm holdings 
lazard group has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary with respect to those vies and  as a result  the company no longer consolidates such vies
