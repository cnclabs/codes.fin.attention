item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated products that address large and growing markets and are based on proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
we have developed two commercial products 
glumetza metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes that we jointly commercialize in the united states with king pharmaceuticals  inc proquin xr ciprofloxacin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections that esprit pharma  inc markets in the united states 
we have a three pronged approach to product development designed to optimize the use and value of our drug delivery technologies  while managing the costs and risks associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
we develop products for our own account that are designed to compete in large growing markets and that can be highly differentiated from immediate release versions of the compounds upon which they are based 
second  we selectively enter into collaborative partnerships with other companies where the unique capabilities of our technology can provide superior value to a partner s compound  resulting in significantly greater value for depomed than a traditional fee for service arrangement 
third  we enter into arrangements that enable our technology to be applied by other companies to a greater number of compounds than our infrastructure can support  so as to derive additional value from our technology 
we plan to commercialize our proprietary products  relying on partners to cover the large primary care audiences  while maintaining co promotion and distribution rights in order to be in a position to create our own sales force when appropriate  thereby increasing the value to us of our products  and our control over them 
our most advanced product candidate is gabapentin gr  an extended release form of gabapentin we are developing 
with respect to gabapentin gr  we have completed enrollment of a phase clinical trial for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia  completed and announced positive results of a phase clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  and submitted an investigational new drug application for a phase clinical trial for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
we have other product candidates in earlier stages of development  including a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
the glumetza product that we sell to wholesalers and retail pharmacies is subject to rights of return up to twelve months after product expiration 
given the limited sales history of glumetza  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of glumetza until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time glumetza units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information  including third party market research data  information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and out movement and retail pharmacy re stocking activity 
glumetza was launched in september and accordingly  the company has not had significant history estimating the number of patient prescriptions dispensed 
if we underestimate or overestimate patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period  adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods 
as a result of this policy  we recognized  in glumetza product revenue in  which is net of estimated patient support program discounts  wholesaler fees  stocking allowances  prompt payment discounts and chargebacks 
we have a deferred revenue balance of million at december  for glumetza product shipments  net of estimated patient support program discounts  wholesaler fees  stocking allowances  prompt payment discounts and chargebacks 
in addition  the costs of manufacturing glumetza associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced a patient support program for glumetza which has two components 
patients who participate in the glumetza loyalty card program receive discounts of up to off their required co pay for a glumetza prescription 
in addition to the loyalty card program  a separate voucher program provides patients with a supply of tablets at no cost to the patient when the voucher is redeemed at a pharmacy 
our costs associated with actual patient support program discounts redeemed are recorded as a reduction of revenue and were minimal in we have made estimates of our costs associated with loyalty cards and vouchers that have been dispensed to patients and yet to be redeemed in  and have included these estimates as a reduction to deferred revenue 
product sales revenue related to our supply agreement with esprit for proquin xr is recognized after the expiration of a day period in which esprit may reject product that does not meet agreed upon specifications 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with applicable contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize royalties under our agreement with esprit based on esprit s sales  net of any estimated returns  discounts  rebates and chargebacks 
royalties received under our agreement with esprit that are greater than the minimum royalty due are recognized based on esprit s sales  net of any estimated returns  discounts  rebates and chargebacks 
total royalty revenue recognized by the company through december  was equal to esprit s minimum royalty obligation 
royalties received under our agreement with biovail related to the marketing of glumetza in canada are recognized when the royalty payments are received as the amounts are not estimable 
royalty payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as royalty advances until earned 
collaborative revenue recognized relates to services rendered in connection with collaborative arrangements and the achievement of milestones under such arrangements 
revenue related to collaborative agreements with corporate partners is recognized as the expenses are incurred under each contract 
we are required to perform services as specified in each respective agreement on a best or commercially reasonable efforts basis  and we are reimbursed based on the costs incurred on each specific contract 
nonrefundable substantive milestone payments are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that milestone provision of the arrangement and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
license fee payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees  clinical trial costs  facilities costs  administrative expenses and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overstimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation as of january   we began accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
for our volatility assumption  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
we have concluded that our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and therefore  as of january   we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
fas r requires that employee and director stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
stock based compensation expense recognized under fas r in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  related to stock options and the espp was  which consisted of  in research and development expense   in selling  general and administrative expense and  in cost of sales 
as a result of adopting fas r  our net loss for the year ended december  was  higher than if we continued to account for stock based compensation under apb as we did in comparable prior year periods 
accordingly  basic and diluted net loss applicable to common stock shareholders per share for the year ended december  was higher than if we continued to account for stock based compensation under apb the implementation of fas r did not have an impact on our cash flows for the year ended december  prior to january   we measured compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
under apb no 
 no stock based compensation was recognized for the espp or for option grants when the exercise price of the options granted was equal to or greater than the fair value market price of the stock on the grant date 
in accordance with the provisions of fas r  we eliminated the balance of the deferred compensation calculated under apb no 
to the common stock account on january  for the years ended december  and we recognized approximately  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for employees under apb no 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
prior to the adoption of fas r  pro forma information required under fas included forfeitures as they occurred 
results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized in the following table product sales proquin xr glumetza total product sales royalties proquin xr glumetza total royalties license revenue proquin xr glumetza total license revenue collaborative revenue total revenues product sales we began selling glumetza in september to wholesalers and retail pharmacies that is subject to rights of return up to twelve months after product expiration 
given the limited sales history of glumetza and return privileges  the company currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of glumetza to our customers until such time glumetza units are dispensed through patient prescriptions 
we estimate the volume of prescription units dispensed by pharmacies based on data provided by external  independent sources 
in  we recognized  of product sales of glumetza  which is net of estimated patient support program discounts  wholesaler fees  stocking allowances  prompt payment discounts and chargebacks 
we have deferred recognition of revenue on glumetza product shipments to customers in which we estimate have not been dispensed through patient prescriptions 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on glumetza product shipments  which is net of estimated patient support program discounts  wholesaler fees  stocking allowances  prompt payment discounts and chargebacks 
proquin xr product sales relate to our supply agreement with esprit 
we began supplying esprit with commercial quantities of proquin xr in the fourth quarter of all revenue recognized related to proquin xr product sales in was recorded in the first half of the year 
as a result of their existing inventory levels and demand forecast for proquin xr product  esprit did not make any purchases from us in the second half of royalties our agreement with esprit provides for royalty payments by esprit to us of percent to percent of proquin xr net sales in the united states  based on escalating net sales and subject to certain minimum royalty amounts 
esprit s minimum royalty amount for was million and under our amended license agreement entered into in july  amounts paid by esprit for royalties were creditable against the minimum royalty obligation 
net sales of proquin xr by esprit for and did not reach levels that would obligate esprit to pay an amount greater than the minimum royalty obligation  and accordingly  through january  esprit has paid us million in total royalties for and we recognized million in royalty revenue under this agreement in  which represents the million minimum royalty obligation less million of royalty revenue recognized in esprit s minimum royalty obligation for is million  and in subsequent years is million per year  subject to annual increases in the consumer price index beginning in should esprit not pay us the minimum royalty due under the agreement in future years  it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in  we received royalties of  from biovail based on net sales of the mg glumetza in canada 
license revenue as of december   we have received million in license fees under our license agreement with esprit for proquin xr 
we received million in license fees in july and an additional million in december the license fees received are being recognized as revenue ratably commencing on our receipt of the fees through june  which represents the length of time we are obligated to manufacture proquin xr under our proquin xr supply agreement with esprit 
accordingly  license revenue increased in over as a result of a full year of amortization rather than a partial year of amortization in esprit is obligated to pay us an additional million in july should esprit not pay us the final million license fee installment  it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we also received million in license fees from biovail in july we are recognizing the million license fee payment as revenue ratably until february  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay biovail on net sales of glumetza in the united states and for our obligation to use biovail as our sole supplier of the mg glumetza  should the mg glumetza obtain approval in the united states 
collaborative revenue collaborative revenue decreased in from and increased in from as a result of services performed in under our agreement with boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  which were completed in december we are not aware of any additional work that we will be requested to perform on this pharmaceutical compound 
cost of sales cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  contract manufacturing and packaging costs  product quality testing  internal employee costs related to the manufacturing process  distribution costs and shipping costs related to proquin xr and glumetza product sales 
cost of sales increased in as a result of the glumetza launch in september the costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on glumetza product shipments are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
we expect cost of sales to continue to increase in  as we expect product sales of glumetza to increase over levels 
research and development expense our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product launch 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
total research and development expense  as compared to the prior year  was as follows research and development expense dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year in  the majority of our research and development expense was related to gabapentin gr 
the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily due to completion of our phase and commencement of our phase clinical trials for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and completion of our phase clinical trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
we expect to complete our phase clinical trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in we also incurred an increase in stock compensation expense of million in research and development expense as a result of the adoption of fas r on january  the decrease in research and development expense in from was primarily due to reductions in research and development expense for proquin xr  which received fda approval in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense for gabapentin gr  which began phase clinical trials for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in january we categorize our research and development expense by project 
the table below shows research and development costs for our major clinical development programs  as well as other expenses associated with all other projects in our product pipeline 
gabapentin gr proquin xr other projects total research and development expenses the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives as of march in addition to the products listed in the table below  from time to time we may enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that  if successful  may be followed by definitive agreements to advance development of the product candidate 
program potential indications development status gabapentin gr postherpetic neuralgia phase enrollment complete 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy phase trial complete 
menopausal hot flashes ind for phase trial submitted to fda 
undisclosed compound gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd phase a proof of concept studies underway 
undisclosed compound confidential preclinical studies 
partnered with supernus pharmaceuticals  inc undisclosed compound confidential partnered with new river pharmaceuticals  inc the compound and indication may not be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the applicable collaboration agreement 
we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states  assuming that we are successful 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we began a phase trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in may and we expect to report the results of the study mid if the results of the study are positive  we expect to file an nda for gabapentin gr for postherpetic neuralgia in the fourth quarter of we anticipate our research and development expense to increase slightly in as we expect to complete our phase trial for gabapentin gr for postherpetic neuralgia  commence a phase trial for gabapentin gr for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes  and conduct a phase a proof of concept study for an undisclosed compound for the treatment of gerd 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after approval  which are known as phase trials 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses to support our operating activities  marketing and promotion expenses associated with glumetza  facility costs and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
total selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows selling  general and administrative expenses dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year in  we announced our determination to evolve from a solely product development focused company to an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company with sales and marketing of our own products 
preliminary staffing for these activities began in in  we enhanced our internal sales and marketing capabilities through the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees and the engagement of consultants 
we anticipate the build up of our commercial infrastructure will continue over the next several years 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to approximately million in expense related to marketing costs associated with glumetza  which was launched in september  million in related promotion fees due to king under the promotion agreement related to glumetza  an increase of million in legal fees due to our patent infringement case against ivax  and an increase in stock compensation expense of million as a result of the adoption of fas r on january  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to approximately million in expense related to the planning and organization of commercial manufacturing activities at our contract manufacturer for proquin xr  increased salary expense of million related to bonuses accrued under the bonus plan approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors in july and marketing expense of million primarily related to proquin xr marketing incurred prior to the licensing of proquin xr and during the transition of marketing activities to esprit 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we build a sales force and incur increased expenses associated with the promotion and marketing of glumetza 
interest income and expense interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income increased in over due to higher investment balances in resulting from of our receipt of license fees from esprit and biovail in and also due to higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
interest expense in and was mainly due to interest on a promissory note  issued to elan corporation plc  or elan 
the note was fully repaid in june gain from extinguishment of debt in connection with the formation of ddl  an elan joint venture  elan made a loan facility available to us for up to  in principal to support our share of the joint venture s research and development costs pursuant to a convertible promissory note issued by us to elan 
the funding term of the loan expired in november the note had a six year term  was due in january  and bore interest at per annum  compounded semi annually  on any amounts borrowed under the facility 
however  in june  we repurchased the promissory note with an outstanding balance of  including  of accrued interest  for  including commissions paid to a financial consultant and legal fees 
a gain on the extinguishment of the debt of  was recorded in other income in series a preferred stock and deemed dividends in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share 
the series a preferred stock accrued a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock was convertible at anytime between january and january into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was 
however  as a result of our march and october financings  the conversion price was adjusted to per share 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the series a preferred shareholder to resolve a misunderstanding between us and the shareholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock the december agreement 
pursuant to the december agreement  among other matters  we agreed to adjust the conversion price to per share 
we and the shareholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the series a conversion price 
prior to december  the amounts calculated as series a preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

as a result of the december agreement  we determined that a significant modification of the preferred stock agreement had occurred  and  therefore  a new commitment date was established for the series a preferred stock 
further  we determined that the fair value of the modified preferred stock was below the carrying value of such securities as of the date of the modification  therefore  no deemed dividend resulted from this modification 
also  we determined that although a new commitment date had been established  this change did not result in a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
however  an anti dilution provision of the series a preferred stock was triggered by our january financing  which adjusted the conversion price of the series a preferred stock to 
as a result of the adjusted conversion price and an increase in the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock due to additional accumulated dividends  the series a preferred stock now contains a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
in conjunction with the modification of the agreement  we issued a warrant to the series a preferred shareholder 
the value of the warrant was considered in determining the value of the modified security 
the warrant is convertible into shares of our common stock during the period between january and january the conversion price of the warrant initially was  which was equal to the series a preferred stock conversion price in effect as of january  the conversion price of the warrant decreases by approximately per year during the conversion period  such that the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the warrant will increase by approximately per year 
the conversion of the warrant may be satisfied only by surrender of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock accrued dividends through january   the date the warrant initially became exercisable 
as a result of the issuance of the warrant  the preferred stock may be surrendered in exchange for common stock for an additional three years through january  as long as the series a preferred stock remains outstanding  the number of shares into which the warrant can be converted increases as the conversion price of the warrant decreases resulting in additional deemed dividends on the series a preferred stock 
for the years ended december   and we recognized series a preferred stock deemed dividends of approximately   and zero  respectively  attributable to the beneficial conversion feature from the accrued dividends and decreasing warrant price 
we will continue to recognize series a preferred stock deemed dividends until the earlier of the time the series a preferred stock is surrendered or january as of december   there were  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately  the warrant was convertible into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of as of december  liquidity and capital resources as of december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities since inception through december   we have financed our product development and operations primarily from private and public sales of equity securities and receipts of upfront license fees from collaborative and license partners 
in january  we completed a registered direct public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share with net proceeds of  in july  we received million under our license agreement with biovail and million under our license agreement with esprit 
in december  we received an additional million from esprit 
esprit is obligated to pay us an additional million in july in december  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity  ltd  pursuant to which azimuth is committed to purchase  from time to time and at our sole discretion  up to the lesser of a  of our common stock  or b  shares of common stock 
sales to azimuth under the agreement  if any  will occur over a month term and will be made at a price equal to the average closing price of our common stock over a given pricing period  minus a discount ranging from to  which varies based on a threshold price set by us 
upon each sale of the our common stock to azimuth under the agreement  we have also agreed to pay reedland capital partners a placement fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
as of december   we have not sold any common stock to azimuth under this common stock purchase agreement 
as of december   we have accumulated net losses of million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next year 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and contractual amounts due to us will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least the end of we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including expenditures related to our commercialization efforts  results of research and development efforts  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into  if any  receipt of payments due to us under our contracts with collaborative partners  results of our litigation against ivax corporation  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the acuform technology 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and except for the common stock purchase agreement with azimuth  we have no other committed sources of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  curtail other operations significantly  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our company

contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations are shown in the following table less than year years years total operating leases purchase commitments at december   we had non cancelable purchase orders and minimum purchase obligations for of  under our manufacturing agreement with mova pharmaceuticals for the manufacture of glumetza 
the amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases are expected to exceed these amounts 
we are also contractually obligated to pay pharmanova consultancy fees of  in under a consulting agreement related to our gabapentin gr product candidate for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
the contractual obligations reflected in this table exclude million of contingent milestone payments we may be obligated to pay in the future under our sublicense agreement with pharmanova 
these payments relate to various milestones for the product candidate under the sublicense agreement  including dosing of the first patient in any phase trial  submission to the fda of an nda  and fda approval of an nda 
the above table also excludes any future royalty payments we may be required to pay on products we have licensed or any promotion fees associated with our promotion agreement with king

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us corporate debt and us mortgage backed debt securities with maturity dates of less than two years 
our investments in us corporate debt securities consist primarily of investments in investment grade corporate bonds and notes
