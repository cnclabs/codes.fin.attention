item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
executive summary we are a biotechnology company committed to the discovery and development of improved next generation protein pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease and serious medical conditions 
we began operations in march with the mission to develop important commercial products through the use of biotechnology 
since then  we have established a focus in human therapeutics  particularly on the development and commercialization of optimized protein pharmaceuticals 
our business strategy focuses on developing next generation protein pharmaceuticals that address significant markets  on our own or with collaborative partners 
four of our next generation product candidates are currently in clinical or pre clinical development maxy g  a granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  product for the treatment of neutropenia  maxy alpha  an interferon alpha product for the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection and other indications  maxy vii  a factor vii product for the treatment of uncontrolled bleeding in trauma  intracerebral hemorrhage and other indications  and maxy gamma  an interferon gamma product for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other indications 
in august  we initiated a phase i clinical trial in the united states to evaluate maxy g in november  f 
hoffman la roche ltd  or roche  initiated a phase ia clinical trial in new zealand to evaluate maxy alpha 
we received a million milestone payment from roche in the fourth quarter of as a result of the commencement of this clinical trial 
on march   we received notice from roche that roche will terminate its agreement with us relating to the co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates for acute bleeding indications  effective april   due to the inability of the parties to establish an animal model intended to provide pre clinical de risking of the program 
in light of this development and other factors  we are currently evaluating our plans for the continued development of our maxy vii product candidates 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking all necessary approvals to commercialize products  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our business 
prior to our focus on human therapeutics  we established two industrial subsidiaries  codexis  inc  or codexis  and verdia  inc  or verdia 
we established codexis to focus on the development of biocatalysis and fermentation processes and advanced small molecule pharmaceutical intermediaries for the pharmaceutical industry 
codexis received financing from third party investors and operated as an independent subsidiary beginning in september in february  our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date and instead account for codexis under the equity method of accounting 
to reflect what our basis in codexis would have been under equity accounting  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million in the first quarter of to bring our investment basis in codexis to zero as of february  at december   we had an equity interest in codexis of approximately 
we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of codexis 

table of contents we established verdia to focus on the development of processes and products for the agricultural industry 
on july   we completed the sale of verdia to pioneer hi bred international  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ei du pont de nemours and company  for cash proceeds of million 
in july  we established avidia inc formerly avidia research institute  or avidia  together with a third party investor 
avidia was formed as a spin out of maxygen to focus on the development of a new class of subunit proteins as therapeutic products 
we also received equity interests in avidia through our initial contribution of technology and funding and our participation in subsequent preferred stock financings of avidia 
on october   amgen inc completed the acquisition of avidia and avidia became a wholly owned subsidiary of amgen inc at the time of the acquisition of avidia by amgen inc  our basis in avidia was zero 
as a result of the acquisition  we received approximately million in cash in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia and may receive up to an additional million in cash  contingent upon the development of certain avidia products by amgen inc under an agreement that we entered into with avidia at the time of avidia s formation  we have retained exclusive and non exclusive rights to use certain avidia technology to develop and commercialize products directed to certain specific targets 
to date  we have generated revenues from research collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical and agriculture companies and from government grants 
however  over the past several years  we have strategically shifted our focus to pharmaceutical products and believe this is an important step in building long term value in our company 
revenues from our research collaboration agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect our revenue to decrease in compared to  primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under our co development agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which roche has elected to terminate  effective april  however  due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize certain results of the research  our revenue may fluctuate substantially from year to year  based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
as a result  due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our collaborations or whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands  as well as the results of codexis through february  we continue to maintain a strong cash position to fund our expanded product development efforts  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  we have incurred significant operating losses from continuing operations since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
our research and development expenses for were million  compared to million in and million in including million and million of research and development expenses attributable to codexis  our former chemicals segment  in and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents consolidation the consolidated financial statements presented in this report include the amounts of us and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands 
for the year ended december  and for the two months ended february   of the results of operations of codexis are also included  as well as the financial position of codexis at december  as of february   primarily as a result of the issuance of codexis common stock in connection with the acquisition by codexis of julich fine chemicals gmbh  our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date 
in accordance with eitf consensus  investor accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority stockholder or stockholders have certain approval or veto rights and paragraph of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  we have included of the net losses of codexis in the determination of our net loss through february  in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we are accounting for our investment in codexis under the equity method of accounting after february  we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of codexis 
the operations of verdia  inc  prior to its sale on july   are reflected as discontinued operations 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
on july   we formed avidia together with a third party investor 
until march   our investment in avidia was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and our share of its results was recorded to the extent of our accounting basis in avidia as a component of equity in net loss of minority investee in the consolidated statements of operations 
after march   our investment in avidia was accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
during the years ended december  and  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia 
on october   amgen inc completed the acquisition of avidia and avidia became a wholly owned subsidiary of amgen inc as a result of the acquisition  we received approximately million in cash in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia and may receive up to an additional million in cash  contingent upon the development of certain avidia products by amgen inc for additional information regarding our investment in avidia  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment in connection with our acquisition of maxygen aps in  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in  we amortized a portion of the goodwill each year 
as of december   the net goodwill balance was million 
beginning on january   goodwill is no longer amortized and goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis at least annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
in accordance with sfas  we review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist 
table of contents include existing product portfolio  product development cycle  development expenses  potential royalties and product sales  costs of goods and selling expenses and overall product lifecycle 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external events  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our corporate collaboration agreements generally provide for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  these collaborators may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
such payments are recognized ratably over the related research and development period 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including license fees  and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the up front payments are recognized on a straight line basis over the period 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  we recognize the up front payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of our total expected effort 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires us to make critical estimates in both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of our obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our collaborative agreements may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license fees  research funding and milestone payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements and government research grants

table of contents stock based compensation expense beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility and future stock price trends based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  amortized on a graded vesting basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
under this method of implementation  no restatement of prior periods has been made 
prior to our implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas since the exercise price of all options granted was not below the fair market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date  prior to our implementation of sfas r we generally recognized no equity based compensation expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation for a further discussion 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  was million related to employee stock options   related to consultant stock options and  related to the espp 
as a result of its implementation of sfas r  our net loss for the year ended december  increased by million 
the implementation of sfas r also increased basic and fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations by for the year ended december  the implementation of sfas r did not have an impact on cash flows from operations during the year ended december  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and million in under the provisions of apb these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
we recognized stock compensation expense related to the deferred compensation amortization on these option grants  which relate to research and development expense and general and administrative expense  as shown in the following table in thousands research and development general and administrative 
table of contents as of december   we had fully amortized to expense all deferred compensation relating to pre ipo grants of stock options to employees 
in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in   in and  in stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants included in research and development expense was  in   in and  in stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants included in general and administrative expense was  in  none in and  in results of operations revenues our total revenues were million in  compared to million in and million in our revenues are derived primarily from research collaboration agreements and government research grants 
revenues from our research collaboration agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and revenues from government research grants were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to including million of revenues attributable to codexis in was primarily due to collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  including milestone payments totaling million 
the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to the completion of the research and development funding terms of several collaborations during those periods and the deconsolidation of codexis as of february this decrease was offset  in part  by the achievement of significant milestones from roche in totaling million with regard to our maxy alpha product candidates 
the increase in grant revenue of million from to and million from to primarily reflects an increase in activity due to the beginning of three new government grant projects in the third quarter of in  roche was the only collaborative partner that contributed to our collaborative research and development revenues 
the initial funded research term of our collaboration with roche for our maxy alpha product candidates ended in december in december  we entered into a new collaboration with roche for co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates 
for the year ended december   revenues for the co development of our maxy vii product candidates are net of the cost sharing amounts that we owed to roche 
our revenues for relating to our maxy vii collaboration with roche consisted primarily of a million milestone payment  million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities and million related to the amortization of the non refundable up front payment we received from roche in december our revenues for also include a million milestone payment we received from roche as a result of the initiation by roche of clinical trials of our maxy alpha product candidate 
in march  we received written notice from roche that it has elected to terminate the collaboration agreement for co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates  effective april  as a result of the termination of the agreement  we have approximately million of deferred revenue relating to the up front fee of million received from roche in that we expect to recognize in the first half of we expect our revenue for to decrease compared to  due primarily to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue  including revenue earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities  under our co development agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which roche has elected to terminate  effective april  however  due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize certain results of the research  our revenue may fluctuate substantially from year to year  based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
as a result  due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our collaborations or whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product 

table of contents prior to our deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   we operated as two segments  human therapeutics and chemicals 
revenues for each operating segment were derived from our research collaboration agreements and government research grants and were categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
results of codexis through february  are shown as our chemicals segment 
after february   we have operated as one segment  human therapeutics 
the following table presents revenues for each operating segment in thousands year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals through february  total revenue the increased revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to was primarily due to collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche for our maxy vii product candidates and an increase in activity on our existing grant projects 
the increased revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to primarily reflects the achievement of significant milestones from roche in the first and fourth quarters of  totaling million  for our maxy alpha program 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from various research collaborations that came to completion during and we expect revenue to decrease in  primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under our co development agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which roche has elected to terminate  effective april  during and  roche was the only collaborative partner that contributed collaborative research revenue to our human therapeutics segment 
the funded research term of our collaboration with roche for our maxy alpha product candidates ended in december in december  we entered into a new collaboration with roche  which became effective in december  for co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates 
in march  we received written notice from roche that it has elected to terminate this agreement  effective april  research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  research consultants and external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing and research  facility costs  supplies and depreciation of facilities  and expensed laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in including million and million of research and development expenses attributable to codexis in and  respectively 
excluding codexis  the increases in our research and development expenses of million from to and million from to were primarily related to increased external collaborative research expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including the manufacture of product candidates for clinical trials 
for  our implementation of fas r also increased our research and development expenses compared to the increase in research and development expenses from to was also due to termination charges of  in related to a reduction in force of research and development personnel announced on june  stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from  in to million in  primarily as a result of our implementation of sfas r 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 
stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of the amortization of deferred compensation relating to the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  which was fully amortized to expense by august we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours 
table of contents incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by our collaborators and government grants  on the one hand  and projects funded by us  on the other hand 
to approximate research and development expenses by funding category  the number of hours expended in each category has been multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort and added to project specific external costs 
in the case where a collaborative partner is sharing the research and development costs  the expenses for that project are allocated proportionately between the collaborative projects funded by third parties and internal projects 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 
the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  collaborative projects funded by third parties government grants internal projects total research and development expenses related to collaborative projects funded by third parties may be less than the reported revenues due to the amortization of non refundable up front payments  as well as a portion of the collaborative research and development revenue that is charged for general and administrative expenses 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality and may be barred from commercialization if they are found to infringe or otherwise violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
we expect that our research and development costs will increase in over  primarily due to an increase in research and development costs resulting from advancement of our maxy g product candidates through clinical development 
in addition  due to the termination by roche of our agreement for the co development of our maxy vii product candidates  we are currently evaluating our plans for the continued development of these product candidates and the research and development expenses associated with such development 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase over the next several years if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into and through clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our product candidates prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our product candidates against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 
our implementation of sfas r had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share for the year ended december  and is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share in the future 
the continued impact of our implementation of sfas r will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  as well as insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in general and administrative stock compensation expense was million in   in and  in the increase in general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to the increase in stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses resulting from our implementation of sfas r 
this increase was offset in part by reduced personnel costs resulting from terminations and the deconsolidation of codexis in the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to the deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   offset by an increase in professional fees related to an increase in market research and product profile development activity and regulatory compliance costs  as well as termination charges of  related to a reduction in force announced on june  excluding codexis  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  fees associated with compliance activities relating to the sarbanes oxley act of and the expiration of certain benefits under our services agreements with codexis that required codexis to reimburse us for certain administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses may increase in we adopted sfas r as of january  and expect that stock based compensation expense will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share 
the ongoing impact of our implementation of sfas r on our general and administrative expenses will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
interest income and other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net of currency transaction gains or losses related to the funding of our danish subsidiary  maxygen aps 
interest income and other income expense  net was million in  compared to million in and million in included in these amounts are foreign exchange losses of  in and  in and foreign exchange gains of  in the increase in interest income and other income expense  net from to reflects higher interest income reflecting higher interest rates in on lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  plus a decrease in foreign exchange losses 
the increase in interest income and other income expense  net from to was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and higher interest rates  offset in part by an increase in foreign exchange losses 
equity in losses of minority investee equity in losses of minority investee reflects our share of the net loss of codexis 
in may  we purchased  of secured subordinated convertible promissory notes and  in august  the notes and accrued interest were converted into codexis preferred stock and we purchased approximately  of additional preferred stock 
subsequent to our investments in may and august  we recorded losses of million under the equity method of accounting and as of december   we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in codexis 
we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of codexis 
as of december   the company s equity interest in codexis was approximately 
gain on sale of equity investment on october   amgen inc completed the acquisition of avidia and avidia became a wholly owned subsidiary of amgen inc as a result of the acquisition  we received approximately million in cash in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia and may receive up to an additional million in cash  contingent upon the development of certain avidia products by amgen inc we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to federal alternative minimum taxes as a result of the gain on sale of our equity 
table of contents interests in avidia 
accordingly  we recorded a gain net of taxes on disposal of this investment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations included in our results of operations is a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in the gain on sale was the result of the sale of verdia formerly our agriculture segment to pioneer hi bred international  inc on july  for million  partially offset by disposition costs 
the results of discontinued operations reflect the results of verdia until it was sold on july  our loss from discontinued operations was million in cumulative effect adjustment codexis was formed in january and financed by us and several other investors in september and october of in august  codexis received additional equity funding from pfizer inc until february   we recognized of the operating results of codexis  even though we only owned a majority of the voting interests in codexis 
at such time  we had recorded cumulative losses of codexis in the amount of million  which was in excess of our investment basis of million 
on february   our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date and instead account for codexis under the equity method of accounting 
to reflect what our basis in codexis would have been under equity accounting  we recorded a non recurring cumulative effect adjustment of million in the first quarter of to bring our investment basis in codexis to zero as of february  this cumulative effect adjustment does not have any tax consequences 
subsidiary preferred stock accretion in  codexis sold million of codexis series b redeemable convertible preferred stock to investors  of which million was purchased by us and million was purchased by several other investors 
in connection with the redemption rights of the codexis series b stockholders  we recorded accretion of the redemption premium for the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  excluding the shares owned by us  in the amount of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the accretion was recorded as subsidiary preferred stock accretion on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction of additional paid in capital and an increase to minority interest on the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
no accretion was recorded for the year ended december  any obligation to make redemption payments is solely an obligation of codexis and any payments are to be made solely from assets of codexis 
since we no longer consolidate the financial position of codexis  as of february   we no longer recognized accretion for the codexis redemption premium 
we also no longer reflect amounts as minority interest on the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we have recorded a million adjustment to additional paid in capital in the three month period ended march  to eliminate the reduction of additional paid in capital that had resulted from codexis preferred stock accretion prior to february  provision for income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  no income tax expense was recorded from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in  we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to federal alternative minimum taxes as a result of the gain on the sale of our equity interests in avidia 
this amount has been netted against the gain on sale of our equity interests in avidia and is reflected in gain on sale of equity investment in the consolidated statement of operations 
for  there was no provision for us federal  us state  or foreign income taxes as we incurred operating losses for all jurisdictions 
for  we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to alternative minimum taxes as a result of the sale of verdia 
this amount has been netted against the gain on sale of verdia and is reflected in gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding expected to be received from collaborators and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all investments and substantially all cash and cash equivalents are held in us currency  with approximately of cash and cash equivalents held in danish kroner at december  as of december   approximately of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of research and development activities performed in denmark by our wholly owned subsidiary  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of maxygen aps is the danish kroner 
in  excluding stock compensation expenses  approximately of our operating expenses related to maxygen aps 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the danish kroner and the euro 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner or the euro will result in an increase of our reported operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december   we have no foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts 
during  we recognized  in foreign exchange gains from hedge contracts and  during  we recognized  in foreign exchange losses from hedge contracts 
these gains and losses were included with operating expenses 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million
