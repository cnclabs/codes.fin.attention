this vertical market includes firms primarily involved in business to business commerce 
they supply raw materials  components and assemblies to consumer goods manufacturers and service providers eg  aerospace  chemical  oil and gas  and electronics 
this vertical also includes firms that produce large  durable goods for businesses and consumers eg  automotive  computers and household appliances 
consumer goods 
this vertical market includes firms that make products for retailers and those that sell directly to the general public 
segments within the vertical include food  beverage  consumer packaged goods  footwear apparel  health beauty  health pharmacy  house wares appliances  electronics  recreation  and media publishing companies 
transportation and logistics 
this vertical market consists of firms providing shipping and transportation services with their own equipment  as well as non asset based logistics providers 
the most common non asset firms are third party logistics and fourth party logistics providers 
segments within this vertical include motor freight  air transport  railways  waterborne transportation and logistics service providers 
retail 
this is a large  competitive and mature vertical market 
customers in this vertical include global tier companies with billion or more in sales 
segments within the vertical range from grocery  pharmaceutical and specialty outlets to department and warehouse style mega stores 
government agencies 
this vertical market includes us federal  state and local government entities  although foreign government opportunities are growing at an increasing rate 
the us department of defense was an early adopter of automated data capture adc technologies and has been actively deploying automated identification technology ait logistics applications for more than two decades 
other departments of the federal government are beginning to adopt these technologies to improve their operations 
state and local governments are also beginning to adopt these technologies particularly in the areas of public safety and service improvement 

table of contents item business continued our strategy is focused on certain application markets  including manufacturing operations 
manufacturers use data collection and computing technology to capture and monitor product flow during the production process  from raw materials or parts through to the finished goods stage 
they also use the technology to track the activities and value added content of labor and to capture product genealogy  product location and lines  supplier information for warranty and liability risk reduction and for regulatory compliance 
warehouse and distribution center operations 
warehouses and logistics operations rely on wireless networks and handheld and mobile computers to transmit inventory data regarding movement  location  quantity and attributes to central host computers 
when information is updated in real time  customers have greater visibility to their business operations and are able to avoid inventory shortages and improve customer service by providing more accurate shipping and delivery information 
as competition places more pressure on companies for faster operational performance  they typically upgrade their supply chain technologies to improve working capital efficiency and customer satisfaction standards  such as delivery speed  in stock availability and order accuracy 
field service 
field service managers focus on work order management and asset management 
work orders tie field service technicians to specific jobs 
management must have information from the point where the work is being performed to optimize an entire range of operations including dispatch  routing and scheduling  status updates  service history  parts usage  call type and resolution  schematics  diagnostics  billing information  invoicing  collections  including credit cards  parts ordering and availability  vehicle location and driving directions  as well as internal metrics such as time to repair  labor tracking and job costing 
automated data collection systems linked with field service management software deliver the real time information required to improve efficiency and reduce costs while increasing customer satisfaction 
asset management is the utilization  movement  and storage of the resources and capital equipment used by or used to support field service employees 
this includes vehicles  parts inventory in transit or on the truck  and test and measurement equipment  as well as assets at remote or customer locations  such as consigned inventory and leased equipment 
equipment tagging and access control to secure storage are growing areas for rfid solutions 
direct store delivery dsd 
dsd is the delivery of consumer good products from a supplier distributor directly to a retail store  bypassing a retailer s warehouse 
activities typically include in store inventory management  store level authorized item management  store level ordering forecasting  product pricing  promotion  invoicing  the physical delivery and return of merchandise  the electronic exchange of delivery data with a retail store dex ucs and shelf merchandising 
general wholesalers and distributors are not included in this category 
in transit visibility 
transportation customers want to know where their shipment is  who picked up a package or shipment  when it was delivered  what condition it was in on delivery  and who signed for it 
whether the transporter is a private fleet or third party logistics provider using for hire air  truck  railway or ocean container operations  the increasing cost of assets  wages  fuel and insurance and operating ratios that run around requires maximum use of assets 
this means turning them faster  eliminating empty return runs  reducing equipment downtime and optimizing effective  efficient maintenance 
all forms of transportation use some form of carrier specified numbering to identify the parcels  pallets or containers that make up a shipment for a particular customer 
mobile computing devices linked with bar code labels and or rfid tags can provide signature capture and critical item tracking capabilities 

table of contents item business continued retail store operations 
retailers strive to reduce the number of out of stocks and to increase the time and amount spent by each customer during each visit 
retail store operations personnel need tools for managing the flow and tracking of merchandise in the store from receiving to stocking  ordering  pricing  price changing  checkout  returns and transfers 
they use scanners  mobile computers  printers  rfid and other data capture devices as the primary technologies to accomplish these tasks 
retail store management 
a recent trend is the desire of retail executives to get the store manager out of the back office and onto the store floor  where he or she can interact with customers and store personnel 
to achieve this  store managers need mobile computing tools that give them access to corporate information  store operations metrics and clerk applications and provide in store merchandise scanning capabilities 
this creates demand for scanning  rfid and mobile computing solutions geared specifically for the store manager 
rfid supply chain 
rfid supply chain includes rfid compliance  as well as all the applications mentioned above 
the addition of rfid technology can enhance the optimization and visibility of information all along a company s supply chain 
rfid compliance involves the application of rfid tags onto cases and pallets and the use of interrogators to read and write to those tags to meet the information collection and management requirements of manufactures  retailers and government entities 
this includes traveling bills of material  manufacturing production routers  product history genealogy  repair and upgrade databases  and bill of lading and security devices 
markets and customers because aidc solutions can be used by a company of any size  the aidc market is large 
market growth is driven by the need for technologies and solutions that improve quality  productivity and cost efficiency in business and government  particularly through logistics automation  supply chain execution  asset tracking  enterprise resource planning erp and e commerce solutions 
we cover the market through a combination of a globally coordinated dedicated sales and service organization  two tier distributors  resellers and independent hardware  software and service vendors 
distributors  resellers and independent vendors of complementary products and services extend our reach in our target and application markets and allow us to cost effectively penetrate and grow market share with small  mid sized and large businesses 
we sell and service our products through multiple sales and distribution channels a direct field sales force that concentrates on large or complex sales  premier value added resellers known as honours partners that provide application specific solutions with major systems integrators and enterprise computing companies  and distributors that provide value added services to smaller independent software vendors and resellers 
our direct sales organization serves customers from offices throughout the americas  europe  the middle east and africa and in selected asia pacific countries  including china and australia 
indirect sales channels include preferred and non exclusive relationships with value added distributors and master resellers 
sales of accessories  certain services and low cost transactional based business can be transacted over the internet 
we have a field based business development function which identifies new market opportunities and supports the sales effort in those new areas 
international sales opportunities exist in countries where communications infrastructure  mobile computing practices and other systems and applications are similar to or likely to become similar to those in the us the extent of wireless systems opportunities in any particular country is based on the level of industrialization  communication infrastructure  the status of bar code implementation  and the regulatory environment for wireless communication technologies 
the major markets for printers and media are manufacturing  distribution  warehousing  transportation  health care  government and other services 

table of contents item business continued our customer base consists of businesses of many sizes in retail  consumer goods  industrial goods and transportation and logistics as well as government agencies  distributors and resellers 
for  one customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
total sales to this customer were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in or competition the market for aidc products is fragmented 
independent market surveys suggest that we are one of the larger participants measured by revenues 
motorola  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  symbol technologies  inc  are major competitors supplying a range of barcode  rfid and mobile computing products and services 
we also face strong competition in single aidc product lines from suppliers such as zebra technologies corporation  which supplies barcode and rfid printers and hand held products  which supplies barcode imagers 
the market for aidc products and systems is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
some firms  including fujitsu and casio  manufacture and market hand held systems for field based ordering and selling applications 
in addition  a number of firms manufacture and market radio linked data communication products  including hand held products lxe  motorola formerly symbol and psion teklogix 
consumer personal digital assistants from suppliers such as palm  hewlett packard and dell are potential competitors for certain light duty enterprise computing applications 
companies such as motorola formerly symbol and entersys compete against us and cisco in the wireless network business 
in the printer market  we face competition from zebra  datamax  sato  printronix and many others  depending on the geographic area 
in the label media area  we face competition from a large number of large and small media producers including  among many others  avery denison and brady 
we compete primarily on the basis of our technology and expertise in applications for specific vertical markets integrated solutions  open systems architecture  and networking and communications expertise  customer relationships and value added service 
other attributes  such as high level support services  product functionality  performance  ruggedness and overall product quality  are important for market success 
research and development research and development expenditures related to our continuing operations amounted to million  million and million  all of which was sponsored by us  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
intellectual property we strive to protect our investment in technology and to secure competitive advantage by obtaining ip protection within and outside of the united states 
over a period of years  we have obtained approximately patents and a number of trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
when appropriate  we have obtained licenses to use ip controlled by other organizations 
the combination of our ip and our licenses to use third party ip have been of value in the growth of our business and is expected to be of value in the future 
however  we do not believe that our business depends on any single patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret or on any single ip license agreement and we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof 

table of contents item business continued we believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
because of the fast pace of innovation and product development in the aidc industry  our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them expire  and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted 
as we expand our product offerings  we try to obtain patents related to such offerings and  when appropriate  we seek licenses to use inventions patented by third parties 
established competitors in existing and new industries  as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents may already have patents covering similar products 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other organizations on favorable terms or at all 
to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors  we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names and  as we expand our product and service offerings  we try to obtain trademarks and trade names to cover those new offerings 
established competitors in existing and new industries may attempt to secure the same or similar trademarks or trade names covering similar products and services 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain trademarks or trade names covering our own products and services or that we will be able to obtain licenses for desirable trademarks or trade names from other organizations on favorable terms or at all 
we protect certain details of our processes  products and strategies as trade secrets by restricting access to that information 
we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent unauthorized disclosures of such confidential information 
from time to time  we license our ip to generate revenue or to facilitate our effort to market and sell our products and services 
while such licenses have been of value in the growth of our business in the past and are expected to be of value in the future  we do not believe that our business is dependent upon any single ip and would not be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof 
we may attempt to license more of our intellectual property to other organizations in the future 
there is no assurance that any of these efforts will be successful 
we try to protect our investment in technology and to secure competitive advantage by enforcing our ip rights 
the extent of the legal protection given to different types of ip rights varies greatly from one country to another 
there is no assurance that our effort to enforce our intellectual property in any jurisdiction will be successful or will be successful enough to materially benefit our business 
seasonality and backlog our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  since our revenues are typically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
see quarterly financial information on page q of this form k for quarterly revenues and expenses 
sales backlog for our continuing operations was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
our business typically operates without a significant backlog of firm orders and we do not consider backlog to be a significant measure for indicating future sales 
employees at december   we had  full time employees  of which  were engaged in our wholly owned subsidiary  intermec technologies corporation  and were engaged in our holding company  intermec  inc approximately of our full time employees are located in the united states  approximately are located in europe  the middle east and africa emea  and the remaining are located throughout the rest of the world  including the asia pacific region  south america  canada and mexico

table of contents item business continued environmental and regulatory matters in january  the european parliament and council adopted directive ec on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive went into effect on july   and prohibits firms from putting on the european union eu market new electrical and electronic equipment that contains more than permitted levels of lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde 
the rohs directive does not apply to units of equipment already placed on the eu market prior to july  in addition  the rohs directive contains exemptions for a certain types of equipment  b reuse of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july   and c spare parts for the repair of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july  the state of california also has adopted restrictions on the use of certain materials in electronic products that are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive 
those restrictions go into effect in other us states are considering similar legislation 
similarly  china has promulgated use restrictions on the same substances as the rohs directive 
china has not yet defined the scope of affected products or the effective date of the regulation and it is unclear whether china s use restrictions will be consistent with the use restrictions set forth in the rohs directive 
other countries outside of the eu may adopt rohs type regulations in the future 
we have redesigned some of our current products to bring them into compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
in other cases  we are replacing non compliant products with new products that comply with these regulations 
during  we incurred million  primarily related to redesigning products to comply with these regulations 
we expect to incur additional costs in the future for compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
the amount and timing of such expenditures are uncertain due to uncertainties about the effective date and final content of rohs type regulations in various jurisdictions and the possibility that rohs type regulations in one jurisdiction will not be consistent with rohs type regulations in other jurisdictions 
radio emissions are the subject of governmental regulation in all countries in which we currently conduct or expect to conduct business 
in north america  both the canadian and us governments publish radio emission regulations and changes thereto after public hearings 
in other countries  regulatory changes can be introduced with little or no grace period for implementation 
furthermore  there is little consistency among the regulations of various countries 
future regulatory changes in north america  china and other jurisdictions are possible 
these conditions introduce uncertainty into our product planning process and could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our wireless products in a given country or adversely affect our cost of supplying wireless products in a given country 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products and we obtain such raw materials from a variety of suppliers 
in general  the raw materials we use are available from numerous alternative sources 
as is customary for our industry  we at various times enter into certain single source component part supply agreements 
we believe these agreements will be renewed in the ordinary course of business

risk factors you are encouraged to review the discussion of forward looking statements and risk factors appearing in this report at part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
business combinations  private equity transactions and similar events have altered the structure of the aidc industry and could intensify competition within the industry 
motorola s acquisition of symbol technologies  inc  metrologic instruments private equity transaction and similar events have altered the structure of the automated identification and data capture aidc industry and may spawn more transactions and additional structural changes 
separately or together  any of these events could intensify competition within the aidc industry by expanding the presence in our industry of firms that have not traditionally participated extensively in this line of business  and enhancing the business and financial resources of some firms in our industry 
there is no assurance that any of the strategies we employ to react to the structural changes in our industry will be successful 
failure of our strategies could result in material adverse impacts to our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
some of our competitors are substantially larger or are more profitable than we are which may give them a competitive advantage 
some of our competitors are substantially larger in terms of revenue or profit than we are 
the scale advantage of these firms may allow them to invest more in research and development r d  systems and human resources than we can 
these advantages may enable our larger competitors to weather market downturns longer or adapt more quickly to market trends or price declines than we can 
those competitors may also be able to precipitate such market changes 
there is no assurance that the strategies we use to counteract our competitors advantages will successfully offset all or a portion of this scale imbalance 
if we are unable to offset all or a significant portion of this imbalance  our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable 
a deterioration of political or economic conditions in a given country or region could affect potential customers in a way that reduces demand for our products 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political or economic conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect on accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological change or technological convergence could hurt results of operations by increasing product or inventory obsolescence 
rapid technological change or technological convergence could render our products obsolete or cause us to have excess inventory or obsolete inventory 
in such event  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete products or parts at substantially lower prices than originally planned  or write off the carrying value of all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory 
this could materially and adversely impact our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to improve our business processes and systems and attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
in order to increase sales and profits  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in efficient and cost effective ways 
to achieve and support these activities  we need to continue to improve our business processes and our financial  information technology and enterprise resource planning systems  and from time to time restructure aspects of our business organization 
successful completion of these projects will require skillful managers and a skilled workforce 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not successful in these areas 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued our industry is characterized by product and technology cycles which may intensify competition  particularly at the end of a cycle 
customer requirements for aidc products are rapidly evolving 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully launch new products before competitors launch comparable products 
if we experience delays or other problems with the introduction of our new products or competitors are able to launch comparable products faster  our sales  profits and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in customer mix can have an impact on sales growth  margin mix and volatility 
since sales to large enterprises tend to have lower prices and gross margins than sales to medium and small businesses  customer mix may have a material effect on our sales growth and gross margins and may increase volatility 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our sales strategy 
our revenue  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we do not achieve our objectives 
if the market for rfid products does not develop as we currently anticipate  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
there is uncertainty about the volume and the timing of demand for rfid products in the vertical markets and applications that we target 
there is no assurance that demand for rfid products in our target markets will achieve anticipated levels at the projected times 
rfid customers typically use pilot programs  qualification processes and certification processes to decide which vendor s equipment to purchase 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in these programs or processes 
the purchase decisions of some large rfid customers influence the purchase decisions of other customers 
there is no assurance that any of these influential customers will select us as an rfid vendor 
since a customer may change rfid vendors over time or purchase from two or more rfid vendors at the same time  there is no assurance that we will be the sole source for any rfid customer or that we will be able to obtain repeat business from any rfid customer 
some vendors are giving rfid products to customers without charge or selling them at prices that are below cost  at cost or only slightly above cost 
if this persists longer than anticipated  our sales  revenues or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
technological convergence could intensify competition in some of our target markets 
a number of firms have developed handheld mobile computing and communication devices such as personal digital assistants and cell phones for light duty consumer and business applications 
improvements in the computing power  the communication capabilities or the ruggedness of these devices might make them attractive substitutes for some of the products that we have developed for aidc applications 
to respond  we must continue to improve our aidc products by investing in r d 
there is no assurance that we will be able to make sufficient investments in r d to keep up with technological convergence or that such investments will result in competitive products 
if our response to technological convergence is not effective  our sales  profits or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
export controls  import controls and operating conditions in markets outside of the us could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
we sell a significant percentage of our products in markets outside of the us and one element of our strategy is to expand sales outside of the us  particularly in developing countries 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries outside of the us our sales outside of the us could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in foreign countries could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our foreign assets at risk 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue or expand sales of our products in any foreign market 
disruptions of such sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued changes or disruptions in our international design  manufacture  production  delivery  service and support operations or in our international outsourcing arrangements could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 
a significant percentage of our products and components for those products are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us and  from time to time  we outsource one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities  by arranging for companies outside of the us to perform these tasks 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of us and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex 
there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks at all or in an efficient or cost effective manner 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate changes by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
our foreign currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
seasonal variations in demand could increase the volatility of our financial results 
our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  as our revenues are typically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
these seasonal fluctuations could increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and results of operations from one period to another 
our results of operations could suffer if we are unable to expand and enforce our patent estate 
one element of our strategy is to expand our aidc patent estate and to use that estate to differentiate intermec in the marketplace or generate royalty revenue  or both 
the creation and maintenance of a patent estate is a complex activity with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we can or will obtain valuable aidc patents in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate 
as part of our intellectual property strategy  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
patent lawsuits are complex proceedings and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in all or any of these cases 
adverse results in such patent lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted if we do not adequately invest in the acquisition  maintenance and enforcement of aidc patents  if we are unable to obtain aidc patents covering products and services that customers consider valuable enough to purchase or if our effort to enforce our patents is unsuccessful 
expansion in developing markets with weak intellectual property regimes could hurt our results of operations if we are unable to protect our technology in those jurisdictions 
our strategy includes expanding operations in and into developing countries eg  china where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing intellectual property rights are very new and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries because we may not be able to obtain or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions and because alternative methods of protecting our technology may not be effective 
our ability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations in those developing markets and in markets supplied from those developing markets 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued patents controlled by our competitors  potential competitors or others may prevent us from selling or may increase the cost of our products 
our competitors  potential competitors and companies that purchase and enforce patents may have patents covering aidc products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their patents to prevent us from selling some of our aidc products  to collect royalties from us with respect to sales of products they claim are covered by their patents  or to deter us from enforcing our patents against them 
as part of this effort  the patent holders may initiate patent infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
as explained above  patent lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any patent lawsuits initiated by third party patent holders 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our customers  we could be enjoined from practicing an invention covered by the patent in question and we may also be required to pay damages for past infringement  which  in our case  might have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
if an injunction is issued  we may not be able to sell a particular product or product line  which could materially and adversely impact our sales  revenues and results of operations 
if third party patent holders are willing to license or sell their patents to us  or if we must redesign the affected products  the associated costs could have a material and adverse effect on our sales  revenues or results of operations 
operating gains and expenses related to patent litigation may materially impact or increase the volatility of our financial results 
since patent litigation involves complex technical and economic issues  it is difficult to predict the amount or the timing of gains and expenses associated with such litigation 
in some periods  patent litigation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods  increasing the volatility of our financial results and possibly impacting our earnings per share 
standards setting activities influence demand for aidc products and may have a material impact on our sales and results of operations 
aidc customers typically want the ability to choose between two or more vendors and to seamlessly use the products of one vendor that work with the products of other vendors 
we and other aidc vendors try to respond to these customer requirements by participating in standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epcglobal 
depending on the standard  the standards organization and the form of participation  we may decide to or we may be required to license one or more of our patents or patent claims on a royalty free or rand basis 
it is also possible that  during standards setting and product certification activities associated with epcglobal  epcglobal rules regarding disclosure of patents may result in a royalty free or rand license of one or more patents or patent claims 
such licenses might prevent us from obtaining injunctive relief against infringers of our patents or prevent us from collecting any royalty for the use of our patented inventions and rand licenses would limit our royalty from a licensee to a reasonable amount that is consistent with the royalty we collect from other licensees of the same technology 
us and international technical and environmental standards and regulations may hamper or prevent sales or increase our costs  which might adversely impact our sales  revenues and results of operations 
many jurisdictions have technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of such products 
such standards and regulations may also require producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
changes in those standards and regulations are always possible and  in some jurisdictions  changes may be introduced with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country  increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  or require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
this could have an adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
us and international technical and environmental standards and regulations may affect customer decision making  which might adversely impact our sales  revenues and results of operations 
technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products  or their collection  recycling  treatment and disposal  may affect customer in various ways 
uncertainty connected with these types of environmental regulations may cause customers to postpone or cancel purchases of our products and that may have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
compliance burdens that affect customers if our products do not meet certain requirements may reduce demand for our products or effectively require us to redesign existing products or components or to use more expensive designs or components  or provide services in that country to support collection  recycling and similar obligations 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to sell our products in a particular country or may have to incur unexpected costs to meet customer demands to support their compliance 
this could have an adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 
we operate in a number of countries around the world and  therefore  are subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions 
accordingly  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
there is no assurance that all or any of these tax audits will be resolved in our favor 
our financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments expire 
the outcome of these tax assessments could have a material positive or negative impact on our earnings and increase the volatility of our earnings relative to prior periods

discontinued operations in  we divested our industrial automation systems ias businesses  which comprised the cincinnati lamb and landis grinding systems divisions 
the ias businesses are classified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the ias businesses are producers of manufacturing products and services  including integrated manufacturing systems  machining systems  stand alone machine tools and precision grinding and abrasives operations primarily serving the global aerospace  automotive  off road vehicle and diesel engine industries as well as the industrial components  heavy equipment and general job shop markets

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product revenues in decreased million  or  compared to the decline in product revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in systems and solutions products 
our analysis of the causal factors for the decline in product revenue suggests that the most significant factor was the announcement and availability of several new products in the third quarter of in the second half of the year  we introduced three new major products 
in light of this announcement  it is our belief that certain customers delayed orders awaiting the availability of the new products 
the second factor negatively impacting product revenue is the rohs restriction of hazardous substances directive  which became effective july   within the european union eu 
the third factor which contributed to the product revenue decline is the increase in competitive programs and pricing 
product revenues in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to a increase in systems and solutions products and a increase in printer media revenues 
the growth in systems and solutions was driven by broad based product demand  including an increase in large enterprise account rollouts across our industry verticals  growth in the indirect sales channel and increasing penetration in the retail market 
new computer terminals such as ck  cn and ck contributed to customer demand 
also during  the series mobile computer had a significant technology upgrade  increasing performance and expanding market capabilities 
the increase in printer media revenue was primarily driven by demand in north america as a result of new product introductions  including the pxi and pxi label printers and a new pb receipt printer 
service revenues in increased million  or  compared to the increase in service revenue is primarily from increases in revenue from the us government contracts and in canada of approximately million each  and a million increase in mexico 
service revenues in increased million  or  compared to the growth in service revenue was driven by improving contract renewal rates  resulting in a increase in new service contracts during  and an expansion of professional services  which more than doubled in  compared to the prior year 
geographically  product and service revenue decreased in north america by and in europe  the middle east and africa emea by  offset partially by a increase in the rest of the world row  for the year ended december  the decrease in emea revenues is primarily attributable to the rohs directive 
for the year ended december   product and service revenue increased in all regions compared to  with north america contributing growth  emea contributing growth and the row contributing growth

product gross profit decreased by million  or  in compared to  due primarily to the decrease in gross margin percentage 
the decrease in gross margins is primarily due to lower average selling prices  with lower absorption on lower volumes 
product gross profit increased million  or  in compared to  due to the increase in revenue  slightly offset by a decline in gross margin percentage 
the decline in product gross margin percentage is primarily due to an increase in the mix of lower margin enterprise business 
the increase in service gross margin percentage for of compared to is primarily due to lower operating expenses and improved margins in latin america due to a higher mix of professional service sales 
service margins are relatively comparable in and selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a of million in compared to primarily reflects the million increase in research and development r d more than offset by a million reduction in legal expense and a million curtailment gain from the changes to our us pension and post retirement plans 
sg a expense increased million in compared to  due approximately to million of incremental legal expense  million of expense related to certain termination benefits and to a general increase in costs 
r d expense decreased million for the same period 
gains on intellectual property settlements in march  we settled an intellectual property lawsuit relating to our battery power management patents 
ip settlements relating to the battery power management patents have been reached to date with companies that  in the aggregate  represent over ninety percent of us laptop sales 
we are involved in various other patent infringement lawsuits that may result in future revenue or gains and operating profit 
management cannot predict the outcome  timing or amount of future settlements or judgments in intellectual property lawsuits 
in aggregate  gains from ip settlements included in operating profits were million and million in and  respectively 
there were no ip settlements for the year ended december  prior to the fourth quarter of  we recognized certain amounts arising from ip settlements as revenue and direct costs related to the settlements as cost of revenue 
we have determined that these ip settlements should more appropriately be recorded as gains on intellectual property settlements in operations rather than as revenue and cost of revenue and accordingly have reclassified million previously recorded as ip settlement revenue and million of ip settlement cost as a net gain on intellectual property settlements of million within the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring costs in march  we announced our plan to close our design centers in goteborg and lund  sweden 
the activities previously assigned to the design centers in sweden have been reassigned to other parts of our business or moved to third party vendors to improve efficiencies and benefit from reduced cost 
in addition to the anticipated cost savings  this realignment of resources is expected to increase new product development capacity 
this restructuring  which was substantially completed by the end of  resulted in charges for severance of million for the elimination of positions in sweden 
the restructuring costs also included facility closure costs of million  and other related costs of million 
on november   we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce costs  streamline operations and improve productivity 
the restructuring includes headcount reductions and consolidation of certain facilities on a regional and or global basis 
the restructuring is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of and full implementation of the plan is expected to be completed by the end of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges for severance of million for the termination of employees and of other exit costs in accordance with sfas as of december   employees had been terminated and million in severance costs had been paid 
the total restructuring costs are expected to be million 
these estimated restructuring costs include employee termination expense of million  facility closure costs of approximately million and other exit costs of approximately million 
we expect the remaining unrecognized restructuring costs will be recognized during interest  net net interest income for the year ended december   was million  compared to net interest expense of million in the prior year 
the improvement in net interest income reflects the reduction in outstanding debt balance  as well as higher investment returns 
during  we retired bonds totaling million 
net interest expense for the year ended december   was million compared to million in the prior year 
the reduction in net interest expense resulted from lower average debt and higher cash and cash equivalent balances during we retired our million seven year bonds in march and our million industrial revenue bond in july provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of  compared to a us statutory provision rate of 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to settlement of foreign tax audits 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of  compared to a us statutory provision rate of 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to reductions in us and foreign tax contingency accruals 
the reduction in the us tax contingency accrual relates to credit for increasing research activities  resulting from the resolution of a us tax audit of a former parent for the same issue 
the reduction from the resolution of foreign tax contingency accrual relates to the favorable resolution of a german tax audit 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the tax benefit for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of compared to a us statutory provision rate of 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a million tax benefit related to goodwill and intangible amortization of our swedish operations 
through the implementation of a tax restructuring plan  we ceased reinvesting permanently in our swedish operations in the fourth quarter of the restructuring resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to goodwill and intangibles 
in addition  as part of our overall review of our business operations in and our commitment to a plan to divest its ias business  we recognized additional deferred tax benefits related to its us and foreign jurisdictions 
gain loss from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to dispose of our ias businesses  comprising the cincinnati lamb and landis grinding systems businesses and began classifying ias as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the following table sets forth the components of earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for the years ended december   and thousands of dollars year ended december  product and service revenues loss from discontinued operations before tax benefit for income taxes earnings loss from discontinued operations net of tax on december   we completed the sale of the landis grinding systems division landis 
the consideration received for the landis purchased assets comprised million in cash  a million two year note at an interest rate of five percent per annum guaranteed by the buyer s parent  classified as other current assets on the balance sheet  and the buyer s assumption of certain liabilities  including certain pension and other post retirement obligations 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the note is million  based on the estimated cash flows from the note and a risk adjusted discount rate equal to libor plus 
the gain on the sale of landis was million 
the gain included a million gain related to cumulative translation adjustment  a million charge for the write off of goodwill  a million accrual relating to the fair value of below market leases provided to buyer under the terms of the sale agreement  million accrual relating to leases of retained buildings  and million in settlement and curtailment gains that included million of long term liabilities sold 
we also incurred million of transaction related expense primarily for professional services 
on april   we completed the sale of the cincinnati lamb business 
we recognized a pre tax loss on the sale of the cincinnati lamb business of million during the quarter ended april  during the second quarter of  we recognized an additional million pre tax loss on the sale of the cincinnati lamb business 
the net assets sold of the cincinnati lamb business were recorded at million as of the date of the sale and comprised the majority of operating assets and liabilities of the business 
the loss on the sale included an million gain related to cumulative translation adjustment and a million charge related to the adjustment to recognize minimum pension liability related to cincinnati lamb  which previously had been included in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders investment oci 
we also incurred million of transaction related expense  primarily for severance and professional services 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the consideration received for the cincinnati lamb business included i million  paid in cash on april   ii a million long term secured note receivable with an estimated fair value of million at the time of sale and iii liabilities related to certain pension and other post retirement obligations of million assumed by the buyer 
we were also required to deliver to the buyer a guaranteed net working asset balance 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  we reimbursed the buyer million for accounts payable related to the cincinnati lamb business  satisfying the net working asset adjustment 
in connection with the sale  during the second quarter of  we loaned the buyer million 
this note receivable  the million long term secured note and an additional million of face value note were combined into a single million long term note receivable secured by the assets sold  bearing interest at an annual rate of libor plus three percent as of december  with interest payable quarterly 
principal payments on the note are due in six semiannual installments beginning april of million  million  million  million  million and million 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the note was million  based on the estimated cash flows from the note and a risk adjusted discount rate equal to libor plus eight percent 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december   classifies the million as other current assets and other assets 
in conjunction with the disposal plan  we analyzed the net assets of ias for impairment  resulting in a charge of million in to write down the net assets of cincinnati lamb to their estimated net realizable value 
the charge included impairments of million for goodwill  million for property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets and million for current assets

we made no borrowings under the revolving facility during  and as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving facility 
the key terms of the revolving facility are as follows our obligations under the revolving facility are secured by substantially all our us assets and our us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to at our option i libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on consolidated leverage  or ii the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank s prime rate  plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on consolidated leverage 
the revolving facility places certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries ability to consolidate or merge  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness  dispose of assets or pay dividends 
financial covenants include a consolidated leverage test  a consolidated interest coverage test and a consolidated net worth test  each as defined in the revolving facility 
we also have maintained a secured long term revolving facility and related overdraft facility collectively  the uk facility 
in accordance with its terms  the uk facility terminated on february   and we did not extend the term of the facility 
we believe that the termination of the uk facility will not have any adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity

projected cash flows from operations are largely based on our revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flow from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
additional sources of liquidity include our revolving facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  millions of dollars

we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
expected future benefit payments by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are million in  million for and combined  million for and combined  and million for the subsequent five year period through off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had aggregate off balance sheet letter of credit reimbursement agreements totaling million  compared to million at december  we do not believe that these letter of credit reimbursement agreements have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
inflation in our opinion  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which we operate in  or and has not had a significant impact upon the results of our operations during these fiscal years 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  tax valuation allowances  tax contingency accruals  recoverability of other intangible assets  warranty costs  pension and post retirement obligations  and stock based compensation 
despite these inherent limitations  we believe that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and our financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of our customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written off inventory is sold 
income taxes 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent  feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we record estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
such estimated tax liabilities are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
all of our finite lived intangible assets pertain to our patent portfolio and have estimated useful lives of years 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
warranty costs 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted expected cash flows to be generated by a long lived asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment to write down the long lived asset or asset group to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off our remaining goodwill balance of million in conjunction with the sale of the landis business 
discontinued operations 
divested businesses are classified in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
for businesses classified as discontinued operations  the balance sheet amounts and income statement results and cash flows are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets  to loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  and to cash flows from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 
additionally  segment information does not include the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have retirement plans that cover most of our employees 
some of these plans were frozen june annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with an external actuary 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant internal data  such as the rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated annually 
note k to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for our domestic and foreign plans 
we believe the assumptions are appropriate 
however  these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively impacting future results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the discount rate  used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for domestic and foreign plans as of december  were and  respectively  compared to and as of december  the increase in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects higher interest rates in the current market 
the effect of a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost result in an increase in benefit obligation of million 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
the effect on our pension cost of a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would be an increase of million 
we determine the expected rate of compensation increase based on historic trends and comparisons to external rates 
for domestic plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation increase was necessary and continued to use 
for foreign plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation was necessary as there are no active employees covered under the plans 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of  and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over six years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase of approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease would result in a decrease of million 
contingencies 
we assess our exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from our estimates  results of operations are adjusted upward or downward 
stock based compensation 
as of december   we had four stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
prior to january   these plans are accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
during the first quarter of  we began expensing stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
stock based compensation represents the cost related to stock based awards granted to employees 
we measure stock based compensation cost at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost as expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the expense is recorded in cost and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations based on the employees respective function 
we record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction 
differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid in capital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the consolidated statement of earnings if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid in capital exists from previous awards 
see note f  shareholders investment  for additional information 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition 
revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when the revenue is earned  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service and maintenance revenue is recognized as services are rendered  generally over the contract term  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates and other offerings that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
we accrue the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
we typically do not sell our software products without the related hardware 
our typical products require no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware after it is shipped 
for software sales  and hardware sales where the software is more than incidental  revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as defined in the customer contract 
rapid start rfid intellectual property rfid ip royalties we license rights to use portions of our ip portfolio  including certain patents essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain rfid products 
as a result of our rfid ip licensing program  which ended on august   we have expanded our revenue recognition policy to include the license fees from this program 
licensees participating in the rapid start program typically paid a nonrefundable up front fee and agreed to pay ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed rfid ip 
under the terms of such rapid start rfid license agreements  the licensees receive the right to certain future divisions  continuations and continuations in part of the licensed rfid patents 
non refundable up front fees related to our rapid start rfid ip licensing program are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over five years  representing the estimated future period we expect to receive patents on certain divisions  continuations and or continuations in part for the licensed rfid patents and our estimate of the average technology lifecycle for the automated identification data capture aidc industry 
we earn royalties on licensed rfid products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees report and pay royalties owed for sales made in any given quarter after the conclusion of that quarter 
we have determined that  due to the lack of historical trends coupled with the anticipated escalating business trends  we do not have the ability to reliably estimate the running royalties when earned 
therefore  we recognize such royalty revenue in the quarter in which the royalties are reported to us by the licensees 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
it focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions such as employee stock options and restricted stock units 
the statement requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments such as employee stock options and restricted stock units at fair value on the grant date 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
we adopted this statement in the fiscal first quarter of  applying the modified prospective transition method 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we implemented sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition and measurement of tax positions in previously filed tax returns or positions expected to be taken in future tax returns 
the benefit from an uncertain tax position must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  as well as disclosure in financial statements of uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  effective for january   we will be required to adjust the opening balance of retained earnings or other components of shareholders investment in the statement of financial position for the cumulative effect of the difference in the net amount of assets and liabilities for all open tax positions at the effective date 
we expect the effect of adoption of fin to fall within a range of million to million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our short term and long term borrowings and to foreign exchange rate risk with respect to our foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates as of december   our outstanding borrowings were comprised of million in fixed rate debentures that mature in march and have an interest rate of 
the fair value of the fixed rate debentures on december   as determined based on recent market trades  was million 
see discussions of our credit facilities under the heading liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report and in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not enter into any foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges  and accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded currently in earnings 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of foreign exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedging activities 
during  our sales comprised million  or  denominated in us dollars  million  or  denominated in euros  million or  denominated in british pounds  and million  or denominated in other foreign currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates positively impacted our sales by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively
