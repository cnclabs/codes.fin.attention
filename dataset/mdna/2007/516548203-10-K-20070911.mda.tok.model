item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors including  but not limited to  those factors set forth under part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop and market devices that make it possible to access  manage  control and configure electronic devices over the internet and other networks 
we are a leader in providing innovative networking solutions 
we were initially formed as lantronix  a california corporation  in june we reincorporated as lantronix  inc  a delaware corporation in may our products are sold to distributors  oems  vars  and systems integrators  as well as directly to end users 
in this annual report on form k  we refer to the fiscal year ended june  as fiscal  the fiscal year ended june  as fiscal and the fiscal year ended june  as fiscal fiscal year financial highlights and other information a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fiscal year ended june  are as follows net revenues of million for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million or as compared to million reported for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of a million or increase in our mm device networking product lines offset by a million or decrease in our non core product lines 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to reported for the fiscal year ended june  loss from operations as a percentage of net revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  net loss of million or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  improved from a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by  during fiscal to million 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily the result of an increase in inventories and a net loss offset by an increase in our accounts payable 
in addition  the change in our cash balances is significantly impacted by our cash management activities  which included the timing of cash payments to our vendors and the timing of cash receipts from our customers 
net accounts receivable increased by  during fiscal days sales outstanding dso in receivables remained constant at days as of june  and  respectively 
our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by the timing of shipments within the quarter  our collections performance and the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues are recognized on a sell through basis upon shipment from distributor inventories rather than as goods are shipped to distributors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our dso ratios consistent with historical trends and dso ratios may increase in the future 
net inventories were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  the change in inventories was primarily a result of an increase in i lsi chips  which are sold individually and embedded in our products and ii incremental inventories to support the launch of new products 
our annualized inventory turns in fiscal of turns declined from the turns in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  the financial statement effects of a tax position should initially be recognized when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold should initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect  if any  of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period adopted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec did not or are not believed by us to have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we do not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenues and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
net revenues from certain smaller distributors for which point of sale information is not available  is recognized approximately one month after the shipment date 
this estimate approximates the timing of the sale of the product by the distributor to the end user 
when product revenues are recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience  when price reductions are approved  we establish an estimated liability for price protection payable on inventories owned by product resellers 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenues would result 
our products typically carry a one or two year warranty 
in addition  certain products that were sold prior to august carry a five year warranty 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenues are recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertainties relative to the collection of officer notes receivable 
factors considered in determining the level of this reserve include the value of the collateral securing the notes  our ability to effectively enforce collection rights and the ability of the former officers and one of our current directors to honor their obligations 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally three to twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replacement stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance that would be reflected as an income tax benefit at that time 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future earnings 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating fair value  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment losses 
as of june   we have million of goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate purchased intangible assets when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of these assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital is used to estimate the fair value of the assets 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenues  the remaining estimated economic lives of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of our purchased intangible assets 
in the event they are lower  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain purchased intangible assets could be required 
as of june   we have approximately  of purchased intangible assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party assertions against us will be resolved without costly litigation  or in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation 
if our initial assessments regarding the merits of a claim prove to be wrong  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if further information becomes available that causes us to determine a loss in any of our pending litigation  it is probable and we can reasonably estimate a range of loss associated with such litigation  then we would record at least the minimum estimated liability 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs or recover amounts previously recorded 
generally  legal expenses billed directly to us are expensed as incurred 
legal expenses covered by an insurance policy have been recorded and paid as incurred  reimbursement of legal expenses from insurance or other sources are recorded upon receipt 
this practice was modified in may  when a new insurance carrier became responsible for certain legal expenses related to our stockholder lawsuits 
since may  the new insurance carrier receives invoices from attorneys and reviews and pays these invoices on our behalf directly 
invoices related to stockholder litigation that were unpaid as of june  have been recorded as a liability  with a receivable from insurance to offset that liability 
litigation settlement costs have generally been recognized as a liability  with a receivable from insurance to offset that liability until the settlement is paid by the insurance company 
during fiscal  we concluded multiple securities lawsuits and litigation with steven cotton  a former executive officer 
as a former executive officer  we have an obligation to indemnify mr 
cotton and defend the securities violation that he has been charged with 
there is a risk that our insurance carriers may not reimburse us for all such costs 
accordingly  legal expenses for mr 
cotton s defense are recorded as incurred and reimbursement of the legal expenses from insurance are recorded upon receipt 
as of june   we had  of reimbursable legal expenses recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
as a result of our cumulative losses  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal and liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception through fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and operating activities 
we refer to the sum of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as cash for the purposes of discussing our cash balance and liquidity

our cash balances decreased primarily as a result of an increase in inventories and a net loss offset by an increase in accounts payable 
in addition  the change in our cash balance is significantly impacted by our cash management activities  which included the timing of cash payments to our vendors and the timing of cash receipts from our customers 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds available from our line of credit will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenues  research and development  expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments  and expenses related to government investigations and litigation  which could affect our ability to generate additional cash 
if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may need to raise capital by borrowing funds through bank loans  the selling of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to operate our business 
in may  we entered into a two year secured revolving loan and security agreement line of credit with a bank  which provides for borrowings up to million 
the borrowing capacity is limited to eligible accounts receivable as defined under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus per annum
