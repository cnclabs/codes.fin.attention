the company acquired two branches in prime areas of brooklyn  new york  with million in assets  million in net loans  million in securities and assumed million in deposits 
on november   the bank launched a new internet branch  igobanking 
com  a division of flushing savings bank  fsb 
igobanking 
com provides the bank access to markets outside its geographic locations 
in december   the bank filed an application with the new york state banking department to form a new wholly owned subsidiary  flushing commercial bank  for the limited purpose of accepting municipal deposits and state funds in the state of new york 
the application was approved on march  the commercial bank will offer a full range of deposit products to municipalities and new york state  similar to the products currently being offered by the bank  but will not make loans 
overview the bank s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings  primarily in originations and purchases of one to four family focusing on mixed use properties properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units  multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  construction loans  primarily for multi family residential properties  small business administration sba loans and other small business loans  mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities  and us government securities  corporate fixed income securities and other marketable securities 
the bank also originates certain other consumer loans 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the result of the company s interest rate margin  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the company also generates non interest income from loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing fees  and other fees  income earned on bank owned life insurance boli  dividends on federal home bank of new york fhlb ny stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans 
the company s operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense 
the company s results of operations also can be significantly affected by its periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned 
however  the company has not recorded a provision since management strategy 
management s strategy is to continue the bank s focus as an institution serving consumers and businesses in its local markets 
in furtherance of this objective  the company intends to continue its emphasis on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  transition from a traditional thrift to a more commercial like banking institution  increase the bank s commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens  maintain asset quality  manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds  utilizing the internet to grow deposits  cross selling to its lending and deposit customers  manage interest rate risk  explore new business opportunities  and manage capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively implement this strategy 
the company s strategy is subject to change by the board of directors 
multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family lending 
in recent years  the company has emphasized the origination of higher yielding multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
the company expects to continue this emphasis on higher yielding mortgage loan products 
the following table shows loan originations and purchases during excluding the loans acquired in the atlantic liberty acquisition  and loan balances as of december  loan originations and purchases loan balances december  percent of gross loans dollars in thousands multi family residential commercial real estate one to four family mixed use property one to four family residential co operative apartment construction small business administration commercial business and other total the company s increased emphasis on multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with multi family  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans could require the company to increase its provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained by the company 
to date  the company has not experienced significant losses in its multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loan portfolios  and has determined that  at this time  additional provisions are not required 
transition to a more commercial like banking institution 
the bank established a business banking unit during staffed with a team of experienced commercial bankers 
the bank has developed a complement of deposit  loan and cash management products to support this initiative  and intends to expand these product offerings during the business banking unit is responsible for building business relationships in order to obtain lower costing deposits  generate fee income  and originate commercial business loans 
building these business relationships could provide the bank with a lower costing source of funds and higher yielding adjustable rate loans  which would help the bank manage its interest rate risk 
commercial business loans are generally viewed as having a higher risk than real estate loans  and could require the bank to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained by the company 
to date  the company has not experienced significant losses in its commercial business loan portfolio  and has determined that  at this time  additional provisions are not required 
increase the bank s commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens 
the bank serves many diverse communities in the metropolitan area 
branches are staffed with employees from their local neighborhoods who speak over different languages  enabling residents of these neighborhoods to speak to our banking specialists in the language they are familiar with and the customs they are used to 
the bank is active in many community organizations 
during  the bank established an asian advisory board to help broaden the bank s link to the community by providing guidance on a number of future events and fostering awareness of the bank s active role in the local area 
maintain asset quality 
by adherence to its strict underwriting standards the bank has been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has maintained the strength of its loan portfolio  as evidenced by the company s ratio of its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of and at december  and  respectively 
the company seeks to maintain its loans in performing status through  among other things  strict collection efforts  and consistently monitoring non performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status 
to this end  management reviews the quality of loans and reports to the loan committee of the board of directors of the bank on a monthly basis 
the company has sold and may continue to sell delinquent mortgage loans 
the bank sold thirty five delinquent mortgage loans totaling million and eleven delinquent mortgage loans totaling million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the terms of these loan sales included cash due upon closing of the sale  no contingencies or recourse to the bank  servicing is released to the buyer and time is of the essence 
the bank realized gross gains of  and gross losses of  on the sale of these loans in the bank did not incur any gains or losses in connection with these sales in there can be no assurances that the bank will continue this strategy in future periods  or if continued  we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration 
non performing assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively 
managing deposit growth and maintaining low cost of funds  utilizing the internet to grow deposits 
the company has a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from its market area through its twelve full service offices 
although the company seeks to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers  the company also seeks to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and its strategic plan 
in november  the bank launched an internet branch  igobanking 
com tm a division of flushing savings bank  to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of its full service offices 
also in  the bank filed an application to form a new wholly owned subsidiary  flushing commercial bank  for the limited purpose of accepting municipal deposits and state funds in the state of new york as an additional source of deposits 
the company also obtains deposits through brokers 
management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies 
the company generally relies on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
in creating igobanking 
com tm  the bank s strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings 
in addition  the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which provides it with a source of borrowing 
the bank also utilizes reverse purchase agreements  established with other financial institutions 
these borrowings help the company fund asset growth and increase net interest income 
during  the company realized an increase in due to depositors of million and an increase in borrowed funds of million 
cross selling to its lending and deposit customers 
a significant portion of the bank s lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with the bank 
the bank intends to focus on obtaining additional deposits from its lending customers  and originating additional loans to its deposit customers 
product offerings were expanded in and are expected to be further expanded in to accommodate perceived customer demands 
in addition  specific employees have been identified who have been assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments 
managing interest rate risk 
the company seeks to manage its interest rate risk by actively reviewing the repricing and maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the mix of loans originated by the company fixed or arm is determined in large part by borrowers preferences and prevailing market conditions 
the company seeks to manage the interest rate risk of the loan portfolio by actively managing its security portfolio and borrowings 
by adjusting the mix of fixed and adjustable rate securities  as well as the maturities of the securities  the company has the ability to manage the combined interest rate sensitivity of its assets 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis 
additionally  the company seeks to balance the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by managing the maturities of its liabilities 
during the bank extended the maturity of borrowings as they matured  and focused on attracting longer term certificates of deposit and brokered deposits 
in addition  management s expectation is that the new deposits generated from our internet branch  igobanking 
com tm  will help to lessen our long standing dependency on wholesale borrowings 
exploring new business opportunities 
the company has in the past increased growth through acquisitions of financial institutions and branches of other financial institutions  and will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions that are  or are expected to be within a reasonable time frame  accretive to earnings  as well as evaluating the feasibility of opening additional branches 
the company has in the past opened new branches 
in  the company completed the acquisition of atlantic liberty savings and opened a branch in bayside  queens 
two branches were also opened in queens in the first quarter of we plan to continue to seek and review potential acquisition opportunities that complement our current business  are consistent with our strategy to build a bank that is focused on the unique personal and small business banking needs of the multi ethnic communities we serve  and will be accretive to earnings 
managing capital 
the bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by the ots 
these requirements limit the dividends the bank is allowed to pay to the holding company  and can limit the annual growth of the bank 
as part of the strategy to find ways to best utilize its available capital  during  the holding company continued its stock repurchase programs by repurchasing  shares of its common stock 
at december    shares remain to be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
the company had  shares held in treasury and  shares outstanding at december  trends and contingencies 
the company s operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions  including changes in market interest rates  the strength of the local economy  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
as short term interest rates continued to rise during  we remained strategically focused on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
as a result of this strategy  we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced 
we also established a business banking unit  and launched an internet branch prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans 
in a declining interest rate environment  the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancings tends to increase  as do prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
call provisions associated with the company s investment in us government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment 
such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of the company s loan portfolio and mortgage backed and other securities as the company reinvests the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment 
however  the company typically receives additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced  which partially offsets the reduced yield on the company s loan portfolio resulting from prepayments 
in periods of low interest rates  the company s level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher yielding instruments or other investments not offered by the company  which in turn may increase the company s cost of funds and decrease its net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized 
by contrast  an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which could adversely affect net interest income 
in addition  depositors tend to open longer term  higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect the bank s net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline 
additionally  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re pricing dates 
during the first half of  the federal reserve increased short term interest rates through their meeting in june  while longer term interest rates remained relatively stable 
as a result  the yield curve flattened to the point where there was little difference between the rate on overnight funds and the rate on ten year bonds 
during the second half of the year  the federal reserve maintained the overnight rate  while longer term rates declined  resulting in an inverted yield curve 
as a result  the company s net interest margin declined as the spread between the rate the company received on loans originated narrowed compared to the rate paid on new deposits 
however  since demand remained strong for our higher yielding loan products  we grew our loan portfolio million 
we funded this growth with principal payments received on our securities portfolio  deposit growth  and borrowings 
at december   we had loans in process of million 
during the year ended december   certificates of deposit increased million  while lower costing deposits increased million 
to fund the strong demand for our loan products  the growth in deposits was augmented by an increase in borrowed funds of million during the cost of funds rose to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of as a result of the growth in our higher yielding loan portfolio  and the decrease in the lower yielding securities portfolios  the yield on our total interest earning assets increased basis points during as compared to however  primarily as a result of the interest rate increases by the federal reserve during and the first half of  the cost of our total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points 
this resulted in a decrease in our interest rate spread of basis points to for as compared to for the net interest margin decreased basis points to for as compared to for the net interest margin declined to in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes 
however  since short term interest rates have increased without a corresponding increase in long term interest rates  we may continue to see reductions in our net interest margin 
in addition  the cost of our existing deposit accounts  and the cost of obtaining new funds  may continue to increase 
approximately of the company s certificates of deposit accounts and borrowed funds reprice or mature during the next year  which may result in an increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
also  in an increasing interest rate environment  mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with lower rates do not usually prepay as quickly 
a reduction in the level of our mortgagors refinancing their loans would reduce prepayment penalties we receive  resulting in a reduction in the yield on our mortgage portfolio and net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  this has resulted in our cost of funds increasing more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
during  the nation s economy was generally considered to be expanding 
world events  particularly the war on terror and the level of oil prices  continued to have an effect on the economic recovery 
these economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans  or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the bank to meet their financial obligations 
while we have not seen a significant increase in delinquent loans  and have seen an increase in deposits  we cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the company s financial condition or operating results 
interest rate sensitivity analysis a financial institution s exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed  in part  by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
accordingly  a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the table below sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are based on the bank s experience and industry averages  which generally range from to  depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral 
money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run off rate of and  respectively  based on the bank s experience 
while management bases these assumptions on actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company  there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis at december  three months and less more than three months to one year more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to ten years more than ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgage loans other loans short term securities securities available for sale mortgage backed securities other total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now accounts money market accounts certificate of deposit accounts mortgagors escrow deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities consists of interest earning deposits 
does not include non interest bearing demand accounts totaling million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and deposit withdrawal or run off levels  would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table 
in the event of an interest rate increase  some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable rate debt 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the company s assets and liabilities remains static 
interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products 
finally  the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management s best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies 
interest rate risk the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the company s interest earning assets which could adversely affect the company s results of operations if such assets were sold  or  in the case of securities classified as available for sale  decreases in the company s stockholders equity  if such securities were retained 
the company manages the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  management prepares the earnings and economic exposure to changes in interest rate report for review by the board of directors  as summarized below 
this report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the ots currently places its focus on the net portfolio value ratio  focusing on a rate shock up or down of basis points 
the ots uses the change in net portfolio value ratio to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities 
the market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown

interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this is the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to  combined with a basis point increase in the yield of interest earning assets during compared to the increase in the yield of interest earning assets is primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio to  million  combined with a million decrease in the average balance of the lower yielding securities portfolios 
the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio increased four basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio  excluding prepayment penalty income  increased basis points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to the average rate of on new mortgage loans originated during the year ended december  being above the average rate on both the loan portfolio and loans that were paid in full during the year 
in an effort to increase the yield on interest earning assets  we continued to fund a portion of the growth in the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio through repayments received on the lower yielding securities portfolio 
excluding prepayment penalties from interest income  the yield on loans would have been and  and the yield on total interest earning assets would have been and  in each case  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income from securities decreased million  as the average balance declined million for the year ended december  to million  partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield to during from during the decrease in the average balance of the securities portfolio is a result of the bank s current strategy to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and shift these funds to the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio

the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding prepayment penalty income  the net interest margin would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
there was no provision for loan losses for the years ended december  and in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considers the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
in recent years  the bank has seen a significant improvement in its loss experience  and an improvement in local economic conditions and real estate values 
as a result of these improvements  and despite the growth in the loan portfolio  primarily in multi family residential  commercial  and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  no adjustment to the allowance for loan losses was deemed necessary for the years ended december  and the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was at both december  and the allowance for loan losses as percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the company experienced net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this was attributed to increases of million in loan fees  million in dividends received on federal home loan bank of new york fhlb ny stock  million in boli dividends  and million in other income  and a million increase due to last year s loss on sale of securities due to a restructuring of the portfolio 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase from the prior year is primarily attributed to increases of million in employee salary and benefit expenses related to additional employees for new branches  the business banking initiative  and the internet branch  and the expensing of stock options  million in occupancy and equipment costs primarily related to rental expense due to new branch leases including the new branches scheduled to open in the first quarter of and million in other operating expense primarily related to the amortization of core deposit intangible and non compete contracts  and expenditures attributable to the growth of the bank 
the efficiency ratio was and for years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the efficiency ratio for was primarily related to the investments in the new branches  the startup of igobanking 
com tm  and the business banking initiative 
while we expect each of these to contribute to future revenues  they did not produce revenues sufficient to maintain the prior year s efficiency ratio 
income tax provisions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributed to the decrease of million in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the increased impact on income from tax preference items  primarily boli income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
diluted earnings per share increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to a million increase in net interest income  partially offset by an increase in the net loss from the sale of securities of million and a charge in the third quarter of of million  million on an after tax basis or per diluted share  for expenses incurred in connection with our terminated negotiations to acquire another financial institution 
the negotiations were terminated after several months as the parties were unable to come to agreement on terms 
the year ended december  included charges of million  million on an after tax basis or per diluted share  related to the retirement of an executive  the relocation of various departments as a result of the move of our executive offices to nassau county  and the additional expenses incurred for initial compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  also included a charge of million  million on an after tax basis or per diluted share  for compensation expense for certain of the company s restricted stock awards and supplemental retirement benefits 
return on average assets declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  return on average equity decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to the average balance of the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio increased million  while the average balance of the lower yielding securities portfolios declined million 
in addition  the average balance of interest earning deposits declined million 
the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio decreased basis points to during from during this decrease is due to the average rate on new loans originated during the year being below the average rate on both the mortgage loan portfolio and loans which were paid in full 
this decrease was partially offset by prepayment penalties that had been collected 
interest income included million and million in prepayment penalties collected during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our focus on the origination of higher yielding multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  along with the origination of one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  allowed us to maintain a higher yield on our mortgage loan portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced 
the yield on interest earning assets increased seven basis points to during from during  primarily due to the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio combined with the decrease in the lower yielding securities portfolios 
excluding prepayment penalties from interest income  the yield on loans would have been and  and the yield on total interest earning assets would have been and  in each case  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income from securities decreased million  as the average balances declined million for the year ended december  to million  partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield to during from during the decrease in the average balance of the securities portfolio was the result of the bank s strategy to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and shift these funds to the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio

interest expense increased million to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  an increase of million in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was combined with a basis point rise in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was attributed to an increase in the average balances of certificates of deposit  borrowed funds and savings accounts of million  million and million  respectively  combined with an basis point  basis point and basis point increase in their respective costs

the net interest margin declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding prepayment penalty income  the net interest margin would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
there was no provision for loan losses for the years ended december  and in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considered the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
in recent years  the bank has seen a significant improvement in its loss experience  and an improvement in local economic conditions and real estate values 
as a result of these improvements  and despite the growth in the loan portfolio  primarily in multi family residential  commercial  and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  no adjustment to the allowance for loan losses was deemed necessary for the years ended december  and the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the company experienced net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for same period in the increase was primarily attributed to increases of million in gains on the sale of loans originated for sale  million in dividends received on fhlb ny stock  and million in loan fee income primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous fees collected at the time mortgage loans paid in full prior to their maturity  partially offset by an increase of million in the net loss on the sale of securities 
during the fourth quarter of  million of securities with an average yield of were sold  with the proceeds invested in million of securities with an average yield of 
this resulted in a net loss from the sale of these securities of million 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase from the prior year period was attributed to million in occupancy and equipment primarily due to a full year of operating expenses for the company s executive offices which were relocated in the third quarter of  million in audit and exam fees related to the increased compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  million for legal expenses recorded in the third quarter in connection with the terminated negotiations to acquire another financial institution  million in advertising costs for campaigns to attract new deposits  million in data processing expense  in employee pension and health benefits  million for the cost of certain restricted stock unit awards granted in the current period as the participants had no risk of forfeiture  and million in board of director fees due to the increases in the size of the board of directors and the number of meetings 
the increased cost of restricted stock units in compared to was due to the increased level of the awards to non employee directors 
the omnibus incentive plan  approved at the annual stockholders meeting  increased annual grants to each non employee director to  restricted stock units  while eliminating grants of stock options for non employee directors 
this provided an expense benefit beginning in when we were required to expense stock option grants 
these increases were offset by decreases in salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of million and million  respectively  due to the adjustment to amortization of compensation expense for certain of the company s restricted stock awards and supplemental retirement benefits  and million and million  recorded in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  to reflect amounts due under retirement agreements with the former chief financial officer and former chief executive officer  respectively 
the efficiency ratio was and for years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax provisions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to the increase of million in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  liquidity  regulatory capital and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and other securities  proceeds from sales of securities and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from sales of loans 
deposit flows and mortgage prepayments  however  are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
at december   the bank had an approved overnight line of credit of million with the fhlb ny 
in total  as of december   the bank may borrow up to million from the fhlb ny in federal home loan advances and overnight lines of credit 
as of december   the bank had borrowed million in fhlb ny advances 
there were no funds outstanding at december  under the overnight line of credit 
in addition  the holding company has million in junior subordinated debentures which are included in borrowed funds and the bank had million in repurchase agreements to fund lending and investment opportunities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
management believes their available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  overnight interest earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of days or less 
the level of these assets is dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million from december  the company also held marketable securities available for sale with a carrying value of million at december at december   the company had commitments to extend credit principally real estate mortgage loans of million and open lines of credit for borrowers principally construction loan and home equity loan lines of credit of million 
since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon  the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements  whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of the company s future cash requirements 
the loan commitments generally expire in ninety days  while construction loan lines of credit mature within eighteen months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within ten years 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the company s total interest and operating expenses in were million and million  respectively 
certificate of deposit accounts that are scheduled to mature in one year or less as of december  totaled million 
the company maintains three postretirement benefit plans for its employees a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of september   a contributory medical plan  and a noncontributory life insurance plan 
the company also maintains a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of its non employee directors 
the employee pension plan is the only plan that the company has funded 
during  the company did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan  and incurred cash expenditures of million for the medical and life insurance plans and million for the non employee director plan 
the company expects to pay similar amounts for these plans in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries  and are based on significant assumptions 
the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo for these plans 
the apbo is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date 
the discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today s dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated 
the discount rate used is based on the citigroup pension liability index  and reflects a rate which could be earned on bonds over a similar period that the company anticipates the plans liabilities will be paid 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the apbo  while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the apbo 
during the past several years  when interest rates have been at historically low levels  the discount rate used for the company s plans has declined from for to for this decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in the company s apbo 
the company s actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on the company s apbo and periodic expense for these plans 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the rate of increase in future compensation levels  expected rate of return on plan assets  future increases in medical and life insurance premiums  turnover rates of employees  and life expectancy 
the accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used  there are changes in the assumptions used  or there are plan amendments 
at december   the company s employee pension plan has a million unrecognized loss  and the medical and life insurance plans have a million unrecognized gain  due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions 
the pension plan s unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years 
the medical and insurance plans unrecognized gain is attributed to a reduction in medical premiums 
in addition  the non employee directors pension plan and the medical and life insurance plans have unrecognized past service liabilities of million and million  respectively  due to plan amendments in prior years 
the net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  resulting in a reduction of stockholders equity of million as of december  the change in the discount rate  the reduction in medical premiums  and the freezing of the employee defined benefit pension plan are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of the years in the three years ended december  during this time period  the actual return on the employee pension plan s assets has approximated the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense 
the market value of the assets of the company s employee pension plan is million at december   which is million more than the projected benefit obligation 
the company does not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations 
during  funds provided by the company s operating activities amounted to million 
these funds  together with million provided by financing activities  were utilized to fund net investing activities of million 
funds provided by financing activities were primarily the result of growth in due to depositors of million and net borrowings of million 
principal payments and calls on loans and securities provided additional funds 
the primary investment activity of the company is the origination of loans  and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
during  the bank had loan originations and purchases of million  plus million of loans acquired from atlantic liberty savings 
in addition during  the company purchased million of mortgage backed and other securities 
at the time of the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank  the bank was required by the ots to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits 
the balance of the liquidation account at december  was million  which includes an increase of million  due to the addition of atlantic liberty s liquidation account 
in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the bank  each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account 
the bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the bank s regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account 
unlike the bank  the holding company is not subject to ots regulatory restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends could depend upon dividend payments from the bank 
the holding company is subject  however  to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of its net assets the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its stated capital or  if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year 
regulatory capital position 
under ots capital regulations  the bank is required to comply with each of three separate capital adequacy standards tangible capital  leverage and core capital and total risk based capital 
such classifications are used by the ots and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution s semi annual fdic deposit insurance premium assessments  to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities 
at december  and  the bank exceeded each of the three ots capital requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition 
these policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies 
the accounting policy that requires significant management valuation judgment is determining the allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis 
the remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience 
a full credit cycle must be used  or loss estimates may be inaccurate 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands borrowed funds deposits loan commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and other postretirement benefits deferred compensation plans total the company has significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
the company finances its assets with deposits and borrowed funds 
the company also uses borrowed funds to manage its interest rate risk 
the company has the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature through its financing arrangements with the fhlb ny and its ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker dealers and the fhlb ny 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the company focuses its balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans 
at december   the bank had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of million for mortgage and other loans 
these loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  growth in customer deposits  and  when necessary  additional borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december   the bank has twelve branches  six of which are leased 
the table above also includes the leases obtained in connection with the two new branch offices opened in the first quarter of the bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant 
whether the bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties 
in addition  the bank leases its executive offices 
the bank currently outsources its data processing  loan servicing and check processing functions 
the bank believes that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services 
these arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms 
the contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index 
the amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts 
the bank expects to renew these contracts as they expire 
the amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect the company s employee and directors pension plans  the supplemental retirement benefits of its president  and amounts due under its plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the amount shown in the less than year column represents the company s current estimate for these benefits  some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries 
the amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent the company s current estimate based on the past year s actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries  but do not include an estimate for the employee pension plan as we do not currently have an estimate for this plan 
the amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans  since these are unfunded plans 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the bank provides a non qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the level of at least vice president 
in addition to the amounts deferred by the officers  the bank matches of their contributions  generally up to a maximum of of the officers salary 
these plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds 
employees do not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment is terminated 
the amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts the bank will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans  and the amounts to be paid from the rabbi trust to two executives who have retired 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the current accrued liability for these plans  adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years 
this expense is provided in the consolidated statements of income  and the liability has been provided in the consolidated statements of financial condition

sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet  and to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
the techniques most commonly used in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements are generally referred to as the roll over and iron curtain approaches 
the roll over approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year statement 
the iron curtain approach quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of when the misstatement originated 
sab requires a dual approach that requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition
