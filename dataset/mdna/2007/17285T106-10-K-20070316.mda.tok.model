item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview citadel is the sixth largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on net broadcasting revenue 
as of february   we owned and operated fm and am radio stations in markets located in states across the country 
we have a well clustered radio station portfolio that is diversified by programming formats  geographic regions  audience demographics and advertising clients 
radio stations serving the same geographic area ie  principally a city or combination of cities are referred to as a market 
we rank first or second in audience share in of our arbitron rated metropolitan markets 
our top markets accounted for approximately of our revenue 
on february   we and alphabet acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into an agreement and plan of merger with the walt disney company twdc and abc radio holdings  inc  formerly known as abc chicago fm radio  inc abc radio  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of twdc the merger 
the agreement and plan of merger was subsequently amended as of november  in this report  we refer to the agreement and plan of merger  as amended  as the abc radio merger agreement 
pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the abc radio merger agreement  we will combine our business with the business of abc radio  which includes radio stations and the abc radio network 
the combination is structured as a reverse morris trust transaction 
prior 
table of contents to the merger  twdc will distribute ownership of abc radio to twdc shareholders in a spin off transaction 
as of november   the transaction was expected to be valued at approximately billion  which was comprised of billion in company common stock to be received by twdc shareholders and cash to be retained by twdc 
the cash amount represents the proceeds of debt to be incurred by abc radio prior to the spin off from twdc  which debt is expected to be refinanced by the company at or following the closing 
the amount of the cash to be retained by twdc is expected to be between billion and billion depending on the market price of the company s common stock over a measurement period ending prior to closing 
immediately after closing of the merger transactions and subject to adjustments described in the abc radio merger agreement  the former holders of twdc common stock are expected to own approximately of the common stock of the combined company 
this percentage is calculated based on the number of shares of our common stock currently deemed outstanding for this purpose 
the number of shares is determined on a partially diluted basis  as agreed to in the abc radio merger agreement  and include some shares of our stock that are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of other securities 
final determination of such amounts remains subject to change based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the closing date of the merger 
the merger and the issuance of our common stock in the merger have been approved by written consent by holders of record of a majority of our common stock 
pursuant to the abc radio merger agreement  we expect to declare a special distribution payable immediately prior to the closing of the merger to holders of common stock of the company of record at a date to be set prior to the closing of the merger 
the amount of the distribution will be determined based on the market price of the company s common stock over a measurement period ending prior to closing 
advertising revenue our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local  regional and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
in  approximately of our net broadcast revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising and approximately was generated from the sale of national advertising 
the major categories of our advertisers include automotive companies  restaurants  fast food chains  banks  grocery stores  and retail merchants 
each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
through direct advertiser relationships  we can better understand the advertiser s business needs and more effectively design advertising campaigns to sell the advertiser s products 
we employ personnel in each of our markets to assist in the production of commercials for the advertiser 
in house production  combined with effectively designed advertising  establishes a stronger relationship between the advertiser and the station cluster 
national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission based on gross revenue 
we also target regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets  to companies that advertise in our markets through our local sales force 
depending on the programming format of a particular station  we estimate the optimum number of advertising spots that can be broadcast while maintaining listening levels 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing advertising inventory 
pricing is adjusted based on local market conditions and our ability to provide advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory 
this target level of inventory may vary throughout the day but tends to remain stable over time 
much of our selling activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to changes in demand by varying prices rather than changing our target inventory level for a particular station 
therefore  most changes in revenue reflect demand driven pricing changes 
a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
advertisers and advertising representatives use station ratings to consider advertising with the station 
we use station ratings to chart audience levels  set advertising rates and 
table of contents adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is arbitron  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of audience ratings data 
we believe that radio is one of the most efficient and cost effective means for advertisers to reach specific demographic groups 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on the following the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  a station s share of audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured by ratings surveys estimating the number of listeners tuned to the station at various times  and the number of stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups 
components of expenses our most significant expenses are sales costs  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and administrative and technical expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local management and centralizing functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with vendors 
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of radio stations and interest carrying charges historically have been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill  but also include certain other intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual lives or estimated lives of the assets 
the company evaluates its fcc licenses by market for possible impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the fair value of fcc licenses for each reporting unit contains significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market 
these variables would include but not be limited to the forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and expected growth rates in perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
these variables on a reporting unit basis are inherently susceptible to changes in estimates  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of the fcc licenses on a reporting unit basis 
if the carrying amount of the fcc license is greater than its estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of fcc license in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value  and such reduction may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company s impairment testing for goodwill in each of its markets is also performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
this evaluation is determined based on an income and or market approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of goodwill in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value  and such reduction may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the company s new orleans market sustained damage as a result of hurricane katrina in august and the subsequent flooding of the area 
all of the company s radio stations resumed operations during the first quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
 the company conducted an interim impairment test during the quarter ended june  for of its reporting units  including new orleans 
the interim test was performed as a result of station dispositions in two markets becoming more likely than not to be sold and a change in management s outlook of the company s expected growth in the remaining nine markets as a result of a reduction in these markets expected economic growth 
the fair values for fcc licenses and goodwill for the reporting units were estimated using the income and market approach 
the analysis resulted in a non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of of million on a pre tax basis to reduce the carrying amount of fcc licenses and goodwill for nine of these reporting units  including the two markets with expected dispositions  to their respective estimated fair values 
these nine reporting units were primarily located in the gulf states  southeast and midwest geographic regions 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis of its fcc licenses and goodwill as of the october annual testing date and has determined that there was an impairment of its fcc licenses 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million on a pre tax basis in the quarter ended december  on a consolidated basis  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  and the balance in goodwill and fcc licenses after the impairment charges is approximately  million 
as more fully set forth in the company s critical accounting policies  fcc licenses and goodwill represent a substantial portion of our total assets 
the fair value of fcc licenses and goodwill is primarily dependent on the future cash flows of the stations in our markets 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or us  including the expected economic recovery in our new orleans market from the affects of hurricane katrina  or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our fcc licenses or goodwill below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated by us  or for which we provide sales and marketing services  during the applicable periods 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
historically  we have managed our portfolio of radio stations through selected acquisitions  dispositions and exchanges  as well as through the use of local marketing agreements lmas and joint sales agreements jsas 
under an lma or a jsa  the company operating a station provides programming or sales and marketing or a combination of such services on behalf of the owner of a station 
the broadcast revenue and operating expenses of stations operated by us under lmas and jsas have been included in our results of operations since the respective effective dates of such agreements 
additionally  as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change to a station s format will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with any change to a station s format 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to mitigate the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any 
table of contents particular format 
we strive to develop strong listener loyalty as audience ratings in local markets are crucial to our stations financial success 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net broadcasting revenue december  december  change change amounts in millions net revenues local national net broadcasting revenue net revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher revenues at the company s stations  including stations in modesto  ca  boise  id  salt lake city  ut  and albuquerque  nm  offset by lower revenues in certain markets  including baton rouge  la  nashville  tn  and worcester  ma 
increased ratings positively impacted revenue at a number of our stations  and an increase in political revenues also contributed to higher revenue in as compared to adoption of sfas no

for the year ended december   the total share based compensation expense was million on a pre tax basis  with an associated tax benefit of million  or  net of tax  per basic share 
total unrecognized  pre tax compensation cost related to nonvested stock options of the company as of december  was approximately million

the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to higher programming  technical  and advertising and promotion costs at our existing stations 
selling  general and administrative december  december  change change amounts in millions selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the most significant increase was million of non cash stock based compensation expense recognized pursuant to sfas no

corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  change change amounts in millions corporate general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to the million increase of non cash stock based compensation expense recognized pursuant to sfas no 
r relating to grants of stock based awards made to certain executives  employees and members of the board of directors  million relating to the fcc s investigation of company s activities in the area of sponsorship identification  and increased legal and other professional fees 
the company expects the amounts of corporate general and administrative expenses in future periods will be higher than in the current year as a result of the payments to the company s chief executive officer for the tax differential between ordinary income and dividend income tax rates during the years ended december  and  in respect of dividends and distributions  if any  the chief executive officer receives in respect of certain unvested equity awards  as well as potential additional grants of non cash stock based equity awards  if any  and the expected increase in staffing in connection with the anticipated merger with abc radio 
asset impairment during the year ended december   the company conducted an interim impairment test as a result of station dispositions in two markets becoming more likely than not and a change in management s outlook of the expected growth in certain markets

as a result of the interim and annual impairment tests conducted  the company recorded a non cash asset impairment of million on a pre tax basis during the year ended december  for the write down of the carrying value of the recorded fcc licenses and goodwill 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or us  including the 
table of contents expected economic recovery in our new orleans market from the affects of hurricane katrina  or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our fcc licenses or goodwill below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

depreciation and amortization december  december  change change amounts in millions depreciation and amortization depreciation amortization total depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense related to the company s towers  transmitters and studio equipment that were recorded as part of the acquisition of the company in june as these assets are now substantially fully depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense  exclusive of any significant station acquisitions or dispositions  is expected to decrease in to approximately million as a result of the substantially fully depreciated assets 
operating loss operating loss was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the non cash asset impairment charge of million  the increase of non cash stock based compensation of million  and the million relating the fcc s investigation of the company s activities in the area of sponsorship identification  offset by an increase of million in revenues and a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization 
interest expense  net december  december  change change amounts in millions interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the higher interest rates under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and citadel broadcasting company s overall increase in outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility 
the increase in outstanding borrowings was primarily the result of the repurchase of shares of outstanding common stock of the company pursuant to its stock repurchase program during the year 
the company s stock repurchase program may result in additional borrowings under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility  and this  in addition to higher overall interest rates  is expected to cause interest expense incurred during to continue to be higher than comparable prior year periods 
as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings above  we have received letters from an attorney claiming to represent holders of more than million of the principal amount of our convertibles subordinated 
table of contents notes that purported to be a notice of default under the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes 
the letters allege that events of default have arisen and continue to arise from the abc radio merger agreement and other agreements relating to the abc transaction 
if any of the events described in the letters were to be an event of default and were to be continuing  subject to the terms and conditions of indenture  the trustee under the indenture or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes could declare the principal of and accrued interest on all convertible subordinated notes to be due and payable  and there could be an event of default under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility 
in the event we were required to refinance our convertible subordinated notes  we would expect our interest expense to increase significantly 
additionally  in the event the company completes the merger described in the overview section above  the company expects to refinance citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility with the proceeds of the debt financing expected to be provided under the commitment described more fully in the liquidity and capital resources section below  which will result in substantially higher interest expense in future periods as a result of the increase in indebtedness resulting from the merger 
income tax benefit expense december  december  change amounts in millions income tax benefit expense income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was primarily due to the deferred tax benefit related to the asset impairment 
this benefit was adversely impacted by a partial write off of non deductible goodwill as a result of the asset impairment 
excluding the effects of the asset impairment  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is 
the effective tax rate in  exclusive of the effects of the asset impairment  differs from the federal tax rate of primarily due to the state taxes and non deductible compensation and other expenses 
the effective tax rate of approximately for the year ended december  differed from the federal tax rate of as a result of state taxes and non deductible expenses 
generally for tax purposes  the company is expected to be entitled to a tax deduction  subject to certain limitations  based on the fair value of the underlying equity awards when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised 
through december   the company has recognized pre tax compensation cost of million and million in related deferred tax assets for such awards on a cumulative basis 
as of december   the underlying fair value of equity awards since the date of grant have declined in value and  based on a preliminary analysis  the company does not have an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
accordingly  absent a subsequent recovery of the underlying fair value of equity awards  when the restrictions lapse or the stock options are exercised or expire  the company may be required to immediately recognize a non cash write down of the deferred tax asset  which may be material to the consolidated results of operations  for the tax effect of the compensation cost previously recognized in the financial statements to the amount that is realized 
in the first quarter of  the compensation committee of the company s board of directors determined that specified performance goals were met for the performance period 
based on non cash stock based compensation expense recognized and the expected tax benefit associated with the vesting of performance vesting shares and the distribution of fully vested stock units with deferred distribution dates the undelivered shares in the first quarter of  the company expects to recognize a non cash write down of its deferred tax asset in the amount of approximately million 
additional non cash write downs of the company s deferred tax assets related to the non cash stock based compensation may be required in future periods as the stock awards vest or expire 
as more fully disclosed in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has recognized a deferred tax asset for certain net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax 
table of contents purposes 
in the event that the company completes the merger described in the overview section above  certain restrictions pursuant to section of the united states tax code may limit the combined company s ability to subsequently utilize these tax attributes following the merger 
upon completion of the merger  the company will evaluate the deferred tax asset based on operations of the combined company and determine whether a change in the valuation allowance is required 
the company s state tax rate could also increase subsequent to the closing date of the merger as a result of a change in the jurisdictions in which the combined company will conduct its business 
as a result  upon completion of the merger  we will assess whether a higher state tax rate will be required to be applied to the combined company s taxable income  which could increase the company s effective tax rate and cash taxes on a prospective basis 
in addition  as of the closing date of the merger  we will also evaluate whether to recognize immediately in earnings the change  if any  in the state deferred tax rate expected to be applied to our existing net taxable temporary differences 
net loss income as a result of the factors described above  our net loss was million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the year ended december  included in net loss for the year ended december  was a non cash asset impairment of million  net of tax  or per basic share  related to the valuation of the company s fcc licenses and goodwill  approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense  net of tax  or per basic share  and approximately million of expenses relating the fcc s investigation of the company s activities in the areas of sponsorship identification  net of tax  or per basic share 
included in net income for the year ended december  was approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expenses  net of tax  or per basic share 
the company has valued its obligation to settle dividends in cash upon conversion of its convertible subordinated notes 
this derivative instrument is measured at its estimated fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recorded as a liability 
at each subsequent reporting date  the company measures the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument  and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
the underlying valuation assumptions used to measure the estimated fair value of derivative financial instrument liability are susceptible to changes in estimates 
these changes in estimates may result in a significant fluctuation in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument liability and may give rise to a significant fluctuation in net income 
net loss income per share as a result of the decrease in net income discussed above  basic income per share decreased by approximately  from income per basic share of for the year ended december  to loss per share of for the year ended december  basic net loss income per share is computed by dividing net loss income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
for the year ended december   diluted net income per share is computed in the same manner as basic net income per share after assuming the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent shares 
the diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  include additional shares of approximately million due to outstanding stock options and approximately million shares related to our convertible notes

table of contents depreciation and amortization december  december  change change amounts in millions depreciation and amortization depreciation amortization total depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in depreciation and amortization is due to a reduction in amortization expense primarily related to our advertiser base asset 
the advertiser base asset was substantially fully amortized as of the end of non cash charge related to contract obligations operating income for reflects a non cash charge of approximately million primarily due to our settlement with our previous national representation firm 
under the terms of the settlement  our new representation firm settled our obligations under the settlement agreement with our previous representation firm and entered into a new long term contract with us 
operating income operating income was million for the year ended december   an improvement of million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this increase in operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and decreases in depreciation and amortization expense of million  partially offset by an overall increase in cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  operating income for the year ended december  reflected a non cash charge of approximately million primarily due to the company s settlement with its previous national representation firm 
interest expense  net december  december  change change amounts in millions interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the company s overall increase in outstanding borrowings under the senior debt and higher interest rates for as compared to this increase was partially offset by the net effect of the repayment of million of subordinated notes on february  offset by the concurrent issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
write off of deferred financing costs due to extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we wrote off deferred financing costs of million 
on february   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share and concurrently sold million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
we used all of the net proceeds from these transactions to retire the million of debentures 
in connection with the repayment of the debentures  we wrote off deferred financing costs of approximately million 
additionally  in august  
table of contents we entered into a new senior credit agreement that provides for million in revolving loans through january  in connection therewith  we repaid amounts outstanding under the previous credit agreement and wrote off approximately million in deferred financing costs 
income taxes december  december  change amounts in millions income tax expense benefit income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was primarily due to the reversal of our valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets  the most significant of which was our net operating loss carry forward 
we believe the net operating loss will be utilized within the carry forward period 
net income as a result of the factors described above  our net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations  undrawn commitments expected to be available under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility and proceeds generated from the sale of our debt and equity securities 
pending transaction with abc radio upon completion of the transaction under the abc radio merger agreement  our financial leverage will be substantially increased 
we have received a commitment from a lender  which commitment is subject to customary closing conditions  to provide debt financing in connection with the payment of the special distribution  the refinancing of citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility  the refinancing of the abc radio s debt to be incurred just prior to the merger of between approximately billion and billion that we are expected to assume in connection with the merger  and the completion of the merger  including deferred financing fees  a transaction fee  and other costs 
the abc radio merger agreement also imposes certain restrictions on our ability to conduct acquisitions and make dispositions prior to the closing date 
additionally  we are limited in our ability to issue equity instruments prior to and after the closing 
these restrictions coupled with the substantial increase in indebtedness after the closing could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service and could have an impact on us 
for example  these restrictions and obligations could among others limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions

operating activities december  december  change amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the increase in cash interest payments of million and an increase in corporate general and administrative expense of million excluding the increase of approximately million representing non cash stock based compensation expense on a pre tax basis  partially offset by the increase in net broadcasting revenues of million 
investing and financing activities december  december  change amounts in millions net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a decrease in station acquisitions offset by an increase in net capital expenditures and a purchase of a note receivable for million

if citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility is not refinanced at or prior to the merger  the debt thereunder could accelerate as a result of the merger 
see discussion below in the subordinated debt and convertible subordinated notes section 
subordinated debt and convertible subordinated notes on february   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share  before underwriting discount of per share 
additionally  we concurrently sold million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  before underwriting discount of approximately million 
we used all of the net proceeds from these transactions to retire the million of subordinated debentures it issued in june the convertible subordinated notes are due and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable february and august each year 
holders may convert these notes into common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equal to a conversion price of per share 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes  the initial conversion rate was adjusted to shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equal to a conversion price of per share of common stock of the company  effective immediately after november   as a result of the payment to shareholders of record on november  of a dividend on the common stock in the amount of per share 
as permitted under the indenture  no adjustment was made with respect to the dividend declared to shareholders of record on march   june   or october   and no adjustment was made for the dividends declared to shareholders of record on february   since  in lieu of such adjustment  holders of our convertible notes will be entitled to the dividend amount upon conversion 
on february   the company received a letter from an attorney claiming to represent holders of more than million of the principal amount of the company s convertible subordinated notes that purported to be a notice of default under the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes 
the letter alleges that events 
table of contents of default have arisen and continue to arise from the abc radio merger agreement and from other agreements relating to the abc radio transaction 
specifically  the letter alleges that certain transactions and agreements contemplated by the abc radio merger agreement will or do constitute a fundamental change under the indenture 
on april   the company received a second letter from the same attorney claiming that the company failed to cure the alleged defaults during the more than days that elapsed since the company s receipt of the first letter 
the second letter alleges that as a result  an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture 
the second letter also purports to declare the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes  and the accrued and unpaid interest  due and payable immediately 
the company continues to believe that none of the transactions or agreements contemplated by the abc radio merger agreement nor the other agreements relating to the abc radio transaction will or do constitute a fundamental change under the indenture 
therefore  the company does not believe that any event of default  as defined in the indenture  has occurred or is continuing and does not believe that any holders have a right to declare obligations under the convertible subordinated notes due and payable 
on july   the company filed a complaint against certain of the holders of convertible subordinated notes in the supreme court for the state of new york seeking a judgment declaring that the abc radio merger agreement and the other agreements relating to the abc radio transaction do not constitute a fundamental change for purposes of the indenture 
on september   the company  the bank of new york and hsbc bank usa  national association hsbc entered into an agreement of resignation  appointment and acceptance with respect to the company s convertible subordinated notes 
pursuant to the terms of that agreement  the bank of new york resigned as trustee under the indenture and hsbc accepted its appointment as trustee under the indenture assuming all of the rights  powers  trusts and duties of the bank of new york 
on september   the company received a letter alleging that the beneficial owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes had i purportedly removed hsbc as trustee under that indenture by an instrument of removal  dated september   and ii purportedly appointed wilmington trust company as replacement successor trustee  by separate instrument of appointment of replacement successor trustee  dated as of september  again  on december   the beneficial owners of an alleged majority in aggregate principal amount of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes i purportedly removed hsbc as trustee under that indenture by an instrument of removal of trustee  dated december   and ii purportedly appointed wilmington trust company as replacement successor trustee  by separate instrument of appointment of successor trustee  dated as of december  on january   wilmington trust filed a motion to intervene as a defendant and counter claim plaintiff in the action 
on march   the judge granted wilmington trust company s motion to intervene as the defendant in the action and dismissed the individual defendants from the action 
the company filed an amended complaint on march  against the trustee as the defendant in the action 
if any of the events described in the letters were to be an event of default and were to be continuing  subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture  the trustee under the indenture or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes could declare the principal of and accrued interest on all convertible subordinated notes to be due and payable  and there could be an event of default under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility 
if the convertible subordinated notes or citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility were to become due and payable  the company would seek additional funding in the credit or capital markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the company

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting polices require significant management estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and revenue is recognized net of advertising agency commissions 
based on our past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us for commercials we have broadcast for our customers 
we specifically review historical write off activity  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required to reduce our accounts receivable to an amount that is expected to be collectible 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets include fcc licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we had approximately  million in intangible assets  which represent approximately of our total assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
although the company cannot be assured that all of its licenses will be renewed 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of the company s fcc radio station licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  liquidity  financial position  and results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability 
table of contents of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to the results of operations an impairment expense only in periods in which the recorded carrying amount of these assets is more than their estimated fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our fcc license and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value contains assumptions incorporating numerous variables that are based on past experience and judgments about future performance of our markets 
these variables would include but not be limited to forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and expected growth rates in perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
we determine the fair value of goodwill asset using an income or market approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
we evaluate our fcc license and goodwill assets for impairment as of october  our annual impairment testing date  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the annual test requires that the company determine the reporting unit  and compare the carrying amount of the fcc license and goodwill assets reflected on the balance sheet in each reporting unit to the respective fair value of each reporting unit s fcc license and goodwill assets 
if the carrying amount of fcc license or goodwill asset is greater than their respective estimated fair value in a given reporting unit  the carrying amount of fcc license or goodwill asset for that reporting unit is reduced to its respective estimated fair value 
we have performed our annual impairment analysis of our fcc licenses and goodwill as of our october testing date 
these analyses make various assumptions about growth rates and market conditions in determining whether impairment exists 
approximately  of the company s reporting units  or approximately billion of our intangible assets approximate their estimated fair values  including approximately million for our new orleans reporting unit 
accordingly  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or us  including the expected economic recovery in our new orleans market from the affects of hurricane katrina  or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our fcc licenses or goodwill below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income taxes 
generally for tax purposes  the company is expected to be entitled to a tax deduction  subject to certain limitations  based on the fair value of the underlying equity award when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised 
when the company determines that an equity award is more likely than not to be deductible for tax purposes  the cumulative compensation cost recognized for equity awards pursuant to sfas no 
r and amounts that ultimately will be deductible for tax purposes are temporary differences as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
through december   the company has recognized pre tax compensation cost of million and related deferred tax assets for such awards of million on a cumulative basis 
the tax effect of compensation deductions for tax purposes in excess of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements  if any  will be recorded as an increase in shareholders additional paid in capital when realized 
a deferred tax asset recorded for compensation cost recognized in the financial statements that exceeds the amount that is ultimately realized on the tax return  if any  will be charged to income tax expense when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised or expire unless the company has an available 
table of contents additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the company is required to assess whether there is an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised or expire 
as of december   the underlying fair value of equity awards since the date of grant have declined in value and  based on a preliminary analysis  the company currently does not have an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
accordingly  absent a subsequent recovery of the underlying fair value of the equity awards  when the restrictions lapse or the stock options are exercised or expire  the company may be required to immediately recognize a non cash write down of the deferred tax asset  which may be material to the consolidated results of operations  for the tax effect of the compensation cost previously recognized in the financial statements to the amount that is realized 
significant management judgment is also required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we evaluate our tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
to the extent that we recognize a liability for non deductible expenses  our income tax expense is increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing matters  for which a liability has been recognized  is audited by the taxing authority and finally resolved 
when appropriate based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
in past years  our estimated effective tax rate has fluctuated significantly 
share based compensation 
on january   the company adopted sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
recently  a significant percentage of our granted stock based compensation awards contain performance conditions which require significant estimates regarding whether those criteria will be met and may result in significant changes in estimates which could be material to our future results of operations 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method and  accordingly  recognizes compensation cost for stock based compensation for all new or modified grants after the date of adoption 
in addition  the company recognizes the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards granted prior to the adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for disclosure purposes 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the assumptions used in the black scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we have used historical data for our stock price and option life when determining expected volatility and expected term  but each year we reassess whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense 

table of contents valuation of derivative financial instrument 
we have recorded the fair value of the derivative convertible subordinated note instrument due to our obligation to settle dividends in cash upon conversion  if any  of the convertible subordinated notes in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this derivative instrument is measured at its estimated fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recorded as a liability 
at each subsequent reporting date  we will measure the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
we measure the fair value of the option using assumptions  including the company s current stock price at the end of each reporting period  the expected term of the convertible note  the risk free rate of return  the expected dividend yield and the estimated volatility of our common stock 
changes in these assumptions can significantly change the estimated fair value of the derivative and results of operations 
contractual and commercial commitments in august  citadel broadcasting company entered into a new senior credit facility that provides for million in revolving loans through january  in connection therewith  we repaid amounts outstanding under the previous senior credit facility 
as of december   citadel broadcasting company had million outstanding under the revolving portion of its senior credit facility and we had million outstanding under our convertible notes 
the table below reflects our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligation less than year to years to years more than years total senior debt and convertible subordinated notes interest payments on convertible notes variable interest payments sports broadcasting and employment contracts operating leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations the total contractual obligations exclude the effects of the merger  which is more fully described in the overview section above 
the amounts expected to be paid on citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility are estimated based on interest rates in effect as of december  we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations  we intend to fund these obligations and commitments with proceeds from borrowings under citadel broadcasting company s senior credit facility 
our million in convertible subordinated notes are due february   with interest payable february and august each year 
to the extent that our cash flow from operations is insufficient to repay the convertible subordinated notes  we may be required to seek additional funding from the credit or capital markets in order to repay the remaining balance of these convertible subordinated notes 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with the acquisition of a radio station in salt lake city  ut  we agreed to guarantee up to million of the seller s other financing 
as of december   the guarantee was reduced to million 
during the year ended december   the company purchased the note and therefore the guarantee has been extinguished as of december  
table of contents we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements or transactions 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we believe our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreement  which bears interest based on variable rates 
we have not taken any action to cover interest rate market risk  and are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points applied to the million of variable rate debt that was outstanding as of december  based on this analysis  the impact on future earnings for the following twelve months would be approximately million of increased interest expense 
this potential increase is based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt 
as discussed above under the heading subordinated debt and convertible subordinated notes  we have recorded the fair value of the derivative convertible subordinated note instrument due to our obligation to settle dividends in cash upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes 
at each subsequent reporting date  we will measure the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
we measured the fair value of the option using the following assumptions february  as the term of the instrument  as the risk free rate of return  our current common stock price as of last trading date in the quarter  expected dividend yield of  and estimated volatility of of our common stock price during the expected term which was measured based on several factors  including the limited history of our stock price and the deep out of the money conversion price 
changes in these assumptions can significantly change the fair value of the derivative 
assuming a hypothetical increase of in our common stock price while holding all other valuation assumptions unchanged  the estimated fair value of the derivative liability would increase and income before taxes would decrease by million
