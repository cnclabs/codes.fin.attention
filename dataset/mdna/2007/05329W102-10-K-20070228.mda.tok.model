certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from dealerships located in major metropolitan markets  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing more than of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by ford  general motors  daimler chrysler  toyota  nissan  honda and bmw 
we operate in a single operating and reporting segment  automotive retailing 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  vehicle parts  extended service contracts  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management  driving common processes and increasing productivity across all of our stores 
new vehicle sales account for approximately of our total revenue  but less than of our total gross margin 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising less than of total revenue  contribute approximately of our gross margin 
we believe that many factors affect sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins in the united states and in our particular geographic markets  including the economy  inflation  recession or economic slowdown  consumer confidence  housing markets  the level of manufacturers production capacity  manufacturer incentives and consumers reaction to such offers  intense industry competition  interest rates  the prospects of war  other international conflicts or terrorist attacks  severe weather conditions  the level of personal discretionary spending  product quality  affordability and innovation  fuel prices  credit availability  unemployment rates  the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring  and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles 
increases in interest rates could significantly impact industry new vehicle sales and vehicle affordability  due to the direct relationship between higher rates and higher monthly loan payments  a critical factor for many vehicle buyers  and the impact higher rates can have on customers borrowing capacity and disposable income 
sales of certain new vehicles  particularly larger trucks and sports utility vehicles that historically have provided us with higher gross margins  also could be impacted adversely by significant increases in fuel prices 
the automotive retail environment was challenging in compared to especially in california and florida where the housing markets experienced a significant decline 
in  we saw continued declines in our domestic new vehicle business and a continued revenue shift in our brand mix from domestic brands to volume import and premium luxury brands 
additionally  we saw a significant decline in non luxury truck sales  which we believe is attributable to economic issues 
for  we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that full year industry new vehicle sales will decline to the low million unit level 
however  the level of retail sales for is very difficult to predict 
for the years ended december  and  we had net income from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of and  respectively 
our results were positively impacted by increased gross profits in parts and service and finance and insurance  offset by lower used vehicle gross profit  higher floorplan and other interest expense and million million after tax of stock option expense related to the implementation of statement of 
table of contents financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
the results for and also include million and million  respectively  of premium and deferred financing costs recognized as interest expense related to the repurchase of our senior unsecured notes 
the effect on earnings per share of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the reduction in shares outstanding due to the million share equity tender offer completed in april additionally  during we recorded net tax benefits in continuing operations totaling million 
in april  we purchased million shares of our common stock at per share for an aggregate purchase price of billion pursuant to our equity tender offer 
we repurchased an additional million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million during the remainder of  for a total of million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of billion in there is approximately million available for share repurchases authorized by our board of directors 
future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our new senior notes 
see further discussion under the heading financial condition 
during  million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options  resulting in proceeds of million 
during the years ended december  and  we had a loss income from discontinued operations totaling million and million  respectively  net of income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recognized income of million included in discontinued operations primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters 
certain amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  have been adjusted to classify as discontinued operations the results of stores that were sold  that we have entered into an agreement to sell  or for which the company otherwise deems a proposed sales transaction to be probable with no material changes expected 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates 
for detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
goodwill consists of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  using the purchase method of accounting 
acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of our intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future  and  when the agreements do not have indefinite terms  anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost 
we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives 
goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually at june or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill  franchise rights assets or other intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business 
we estimate the depreciable lives of our property  plant and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe our property  plant and equipment and 
table of contents assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
revenue recognition revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products and sales of parts and services 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
an estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis  however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as earned over the life of the contracts 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals for chargebacks against revenue recognized from the sale of finance  insurance and other protection products  certain assumptions related to goodwill and other intangible long lived assets and accruals related to self insurance programs  certain legal proceedings  estimated tax liabilities  estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations and certain assumptions related to determining stock option compensation

represents scheduled interest payments on fixed rate senior unsecured notes 
estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded 
in the ordinary course of business  we are required to post performance and surety bonds  letters of credit  and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance 
at december   surety bonds  letters of credit and cash deposits totaled million  including million letters of credit 
we do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit 
we have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility 
the amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
as further discussed under the heading provision for income taxes  there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
however  revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events  and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions  such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs
