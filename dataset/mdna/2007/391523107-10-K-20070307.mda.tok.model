the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation will lease the land needed for the resort to the joint venture  and they will have a majority equity interest in the joint venture 
construction on the resort began in october with expected completion in early industry trends 
we operate in the family entertainment resort segment of the travel and leisure industry 
the concept of a family entertainment resort with an indoor waterpark was first introduced to the 
table of contents united states in wisconsin dells  wisconsin  and has evolved there over the past years 
in an effort to boost occupancy and daily rates  as well as capture off season demand  hotel operators in the wisconsin dells market began expanding indoor pools and adding waterslides and other water based attractions to existing hotels and resorts 
the success of these efforts prompted several local operators to build new  larger destination resorts based primarily on the concept 
we believe that these properties  which typically are themed and include other resort features such as arcades  retail shops and full food and beverage service in addition to the indoor waterpark  have historically outperformed standard hotels in the market 
we believe that the rate premiums and increased market share in the wisconsin dells for hotels and resorts with some form of an indoor waterpark can be attributed to several factors  including the ability to provide a year round vacation destination without weather related risks  the wide appeal of water based recreation and the favorable trends in leisure travel discussed below 
while no standard industry definition for a family entertainment resort featuring an indoor waterpark has developed  we generally consider resorts with at least rooms featuring indoor waterparks larger than  square feet  as well as a variety of water slides and other water based attractions  to be competitive with our resorts 
a recent hotel leisure advisors  llc h la survey indicates that the number of indoor waterpark destination resorts has grown from available properties as of year end to available properties as of year end we believe recent vacation trends favor drive to family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks  as the number of families choosing to take shorter  more frequent vacations that they can drive to have increased in recent years 
we believe that these trends will continue 
we believe indoor waterpark resorts are generally less affected by changes in economic cycles  as drive to destinations are less expensive and more convenient than destinations that require air travel 
outlook 
we believe that no other operator or developer other than great wolf resorts has established a regional portfolio of family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks 
we intend to continue to expand our portfolio of owned resorts throughout the united states and to selectively seek licensing and management opportunities domestically and internationally 
the resorts we are currently constructing and plan to develop in the future require significant industry knowledge and substantial capital resources 
several of our resorts have similar family entertainment resorts that compete directly with them 
our primary business objective is to increase long term stockholder value 
we believe we can increase stockholder value by executing our internal and external growth strategies 
our primary internal growth strategies are to maximize total resort revenue  minimize costs by leveraging our economies of scale  and build upon our existing brand awareness and loyalty in order to compete more effectively 
our primary external growth strategies are to capitalize on our first mover advantage by being the first to develop and operate family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks in our selected target markets  focus on development and strategic growth opportunities by seeking to develop additional resorts and target selected licensing and joint venture opportunities  and continue to innovate by leveraging our in house expertise  in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of our third party suppliers and designers 
in attempting to execute our internal and external growth strategies  we are subject to a variety of business challenges and risks 
these challenges include development and licensing of properties  increases in costs of constructing  operating and maintaining our resorts  competition from other entertainment companies  both within and outside our industry segment  and external economic risks  including family vacation patterns and trends 
we seek to meet these challenges by providing sufficient management oversight to site selection  development and resort operations  concentrating on growing and strengthening awareness of our brand and demand for our resorts  and maintaining our focus on safety 
we believe that traverse city and sandusky resorts have been and will continue to be affected by adverse general economic circumstances in the michigan ohio region such as bankruptcies of several major companies and or large announced layoffs by major employers and increased competition that has occurred in these markets over the past two years 
the michigan ohio region includes cities that have historically been the traverse city and sandusky resorts largest suppliers of customers 
we believe the adverse general economic 
table of contents circumstances in the region have negatively impacted overall discretionary consumer spending in that region over the past year and may continue to do so going forward 
we believe this has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our traverse city and sandusky resorts 
also  we have experienced a slower than expected occupancy ramp up and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan  wisconsin property since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
revenue and key performance indicators 
we seek to generate positive cash flows and net income from each of our owned resorts 
our rooms revenue represents sales to guests of room nights at our resorts  and is the largest contributor to our cash flows and profitability 
rooms revenue accounted for approximately of our total resort revenue for the twelve months ended december  we employ sales and marketing efforts to increase overall demand for rooms at our resorts 
we seek to optimize the relationship between room rates and occupancies through the use of yield management techniques that attempt to project demand in order to selectively increase room rates during peak demand 
these techniques are designed to assist us in managing our higher occupancy nights to achieve maximum rooms revenue and include such practices as monitoring our historical trends for occupancy and estimating our high occupancy nights  offering the highest discounts to previous guests in off peak periods to build customer loyalty and enhance our ability to charge higher rates in peak periods  structuring rates to allow us to offer our previous guests the best rate while simultaneously working with a promotional partner or offering internet specials  monitoring sales of room types daily to evaluate the effectiveness of offered discounts  and offering specials on standard suites and yielding better rates on larger suites when standard suites sell out 
in addition  we seek to maximize the amount of time and money spent on site by our guests by providing a variety of revenue generating amenities 
we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include the following occupancy  average daily room rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  total revenue per available room  or total revpar  total revenue per occupied room  or total revpor  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hospitality industry to evaluate hotel operations and are defined as follows occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms by total available rooms 
adr is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by total occupied rooms 
revpar is the product of occupancy and adr 
total revpar and total revpor are defined as follows total revpar is calculated by dividing total revenue by rooms available total rev por is calculated by dividing total revenue by occupied rooms 
table of contents occupancy allows us to measure the general overall demand for rooms at our resorts and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies 
adr allows us to measure the effectiveness of our yield management strategies 
while adr and revpar only include rooms revenue  total revpor and total revpar include both rooms revenue and other revenue derived from food and beverage and other amenities at our resorts 
we consider total revpor and total revpar to be key performance indicators for our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from food and beverage and other amenities 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our total resort revenues consisted of non rooms revenue 
we use revpar and total revpar to evaluate the blended effect that changes in occupancy  adr and total revpor have on our profitability 
we focus on increasing adr and total revpor because those increases can have the greatest positive impact on our profitability 
in addition  we seek to maximize occupancy  as increases in occupancy generally lead to greater total revenues at our resorts  and maintaining certain occupancy levels is key to covering our fixed costs 
increases in total revenues as a result of higher occupancy are  however  typically accompanied by additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
in contrast  increases in total revenues from higher adr and total revpor are typically accompanied by lower incremental costs  and result in a greater increase in profitability 
we also use ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of each of our resorts 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure  and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
see non gaap financial measures for further discussion of our use of ebitda and a reconciliation to net income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process involve the use of accounting estimates based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
investments in property and equipment 
we record investments in property and equipment at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment  including waterpark equipment years we are required to make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in property and equipment we would depreciate and amortize such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation and amortization expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we have assigned to our depreciable assets to determine whether those useful lives are reasonable and appropriate 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate the carrying values of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the expected future operations of the asset 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  operating trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 

table of contents carrying values of goodwill  intangible assets and investment in affiliates 
as a result of the formation transactions  we recorded on our consolidated balance sheet approximately  of goodwill and  of intangible assets related to our great wolf lodge brand name 
the brand name intangible asset has an indefinite life 
in we removed  of goodwill in conjunction with the sale of interests in our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
the carrying value of our interest in the joint venture that now owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts is  as of december  in we removed  of goodwill on our traverse city and blue harbor resorts as the implied fair value of the goodwill  as discussed below  was deemed less than the carrying value 
on an annual basis  we perform analyses to determine any impairment of the carrying values of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and investment in affiliates 
to test goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the individual resort to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of that resort 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the individual resort  we compare the implied fair value of the resort s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the individual resort to all the assets and liabilities of that resort as if it had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the individual resort over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
our assessment of the fair value is dependent on the operating results of the resorts 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of goodwill 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these intangibles 
to test investment in affiliates for impairment  we compare the fair value of the investment in affiliates with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the investment in affiliate is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of this asset

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of this statement are required to be applied prospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda as a measure of our operating performance 
ebitda is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is commonly defined as net income plus a net interest expense  b income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
ebitda as calculated by us is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
in addition  ebitda a does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  b is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of property and equipment that are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in accordance with gaap 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance  it is widely used in the hospitality and entertainment industries to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
using a measure such as ebitda has material limitations 
these limitations include the difficulty associated with comparing results among companies and the inability to analyze certain significant items  including depreciation and interest expense  which directly affect our net income or loss 
management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently  as well as in connection with its analysis of net income 

table of contents the following table reconciles net loss to ebitda for the periods presented great wolf resorts  inc predecessor period period december  january  year ended year ended through through december  december  december  december  net loss adjustments interest expense  net income tax benefit depreciation and amortization ebitda results of operations general our and the predecessor s results of operations for the years ended december   and are not directly comparable due primarily to the impact of the ipo and the formation transactions  our new debt and the repayment of debt upon the consummation of the ipo 
in addition  in march our great wolf lodge in williamsburg  virginia opened  in october our great wolf lodge in pocono mountains  pennsylvania opened  and in december our great wolf lodge in mason  ohio opened

table of contents certain minimum guaranteed amounts of room tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through city of sheboygan loan the city of sheboygan loan amount represents a loan made by the city in in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin 
the loan is noninterest bearing and matures in our obligation to repay the loan will be satisfied by certain minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through future maturities future principal requirements on long term debt are as follows through december  thereafter total short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses  including recurring maintenance  repairs and other operating expenses necessary to properly maintain and operate our resorts  property taxes and insurance expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  general and administrative expenses  and income taxes 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows and cash on hand 
we believe that cash provided by our operations  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to fund our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next twelve months 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities  capital contributions and loans to unconsolidated joint ventures  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our resorts  and costs associated with the development of new resorts 
we expect to meet these needs through existing working capital  cash provided by operations and a combination of mortgage financing on properties being developed  proceeds from investing activities such as the sale of newly constructed condominiums at our existing resorts or sale of majority ownership interest in certain resorts  additional borrowings under future credit facilities  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  if market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 

table of contents our largest long term expenditures are expected to be for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and capital expenditures for development of future consolidated resorts 
our expenditures for such items were  for the year ended december  we expect to have approximately  of such expenditures in and  in as discussed above  we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  cash on hand  proceeds from investing activities and new and or existing mortgage financing on properties being developed 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two unconsolidated joint venture arrangements at december  we account for our unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
our joint venture with cnl income properties  inc cnl owns two resorts  great wolf lodge wisconsin dells  wisconsin and great wolf lodge sandusky  ohio 
we are a limited partner in the cnl joint venture with a ownership interest 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of approximately  this loan is a mortgage loan that is non recourse to us 
we entered into our joint venture with the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation to develop a great wolf lodge resort and conference center on a acre land parcel in grand mound  washington 
this joint venture is a limited liability company  we are a member of that limited liability company with a ownership interest 
as capital may be required to fund the activities of these resorts  we may be required to fund in the future the joint ventures shares of the costs not funded by the majority owner of the joint venture  the joint ventures operations or outside financing 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in these joint ventures  management cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that we may be required to fund in the long term 
management does not currently believe that any additional future funding of these joint ventures other than the initial capital contributions to the joint ventures  will have an adverse effect on our financial condition  however  as we do not expect to make significant future capital contributions to these joint ventures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment terms less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations construction contracts total includes  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by our sheboygan resort 
as we develop future resorts  we expect to incur significant additional debt and construction contract obligations 
working capital we had  of available cash and cash equivalents and working capital of  current assets less current liabilities at december   compared to the  of available cash and cash equivalents and  of working capital at december  
table of contents cash flows comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from a reduction in the net operating loss excluding our impairment loss for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was lower for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily because of the cash received due to the sale of interests in of our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from proceeds from our pocono mountains mortgage loan for  comparison of year ended december  for the company to year ended december  for the predecessor great wolf resorts great wolf great wolf resorts resorts predecessor year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted from a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities and prepaid expenses and other assets 
this decrease was offset by higher depreciation in the period 
investing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets in the period as compared to the period 
also  in we purchased the resorts as part of the ipo 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the effect of the ipo in inflation we are able to change room and amenity rates at our resort properties on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation can often be passed along to customers 
however  a weak economic environment that decreased overall demand for our products and services could restrict our ability to raise room and amenity rates to offset rising costs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in the future  we may use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and anticipate entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
our earnings are also affected by the changes in our interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short term investments  and our interest expense from variable rate debt instruments 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately  this debt consisted of  of fixed rate debt secured by two of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at 
 of subordinated debentures that bear interest at a fixed rate of through march and then at a floating rate of libor plus basis points thereafter 
the securities mature in march  of fixed rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at  of variable rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points 
the total rate was at december   of fixed rate debt effective interest rate of recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of noninterest bearing debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by the sheboygan resort  and as of december   we estimate the total fair value of the indebtedness described above to be  more than their total carrying values  due to the terms of the existing debt being different than those terms we believe would currently be available to us for indebtedness with similar risks and remaining maturities 
if the prime rate and or libor were to increase by or basis points  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately annually 
if the prime rate were to decrease by or basis points  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would be approximately annually
