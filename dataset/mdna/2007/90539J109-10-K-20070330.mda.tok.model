certain information discussed below is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
executive overview the company posted net income for the year ended december  of million  compared to million in earnings per share decreased to compared to for return on average equity was compared to in and return on average assets was 
compared to 
in the company s results in  versus  reflected a decrease in net interest income of million  or  from the prior year  ending the year at million 
this decrease was the result of continued margin compression resulting in a basis point decline in the net interest margin to for fiscal year from for this decrease was offset in part by continued growth in earning assets during the year 
non interest income increased by  to million  due primarily to continued growth in financial services fees and commissions as well as increases in bankcard fees and other income  partially offset by net losses on sales of securities 
non interest expenses ended the year at million  an increase of  or  over the prior year

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of mortgage servicing rights 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual r esults could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions 
allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of probable losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights 
the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is also a critical accounting policy which requires significant estimates and assumptions 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when servicing rights are acquired through the sale of residential mortgage loans 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
management uses  on a quarterly basis  an independent firm which specializes in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value which is recorded on the balance sheet 
this includes an evaluation for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights  which can vary depending upon current interest rates and prepayment expectations  as compared to amortized cost 
when the book value exceeds the fair value  a valuation allowance is recorded against these servicing assets

net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  continues to be the primary source of operating revenue for the company 
during  net interest income accounted for of total revenues for the company 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the volume  mix  and interest rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was million in  a million decrease compared to million in during  net interest margin declined basis points to  resulting primarily from increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities over and above improvements in the yield on interest earning assets

the increase in borrowings was in part due to the issuance of million of junior subordinated debt securities  related to our issuance of trust preferred securities  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
the company has contributed mill ion of the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities to the bank as tier capital to support the bank s growth

loan concentrations 
the bank grants residential  commercial and consumer loans to customers principally located in hancock  washington  knox  lincoln and waldo counties of the state of maine 
although the loan portfolio is diversified  a substantial portion of our debtors ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the economic conditions in the area  especially in the real estate sector 
as of december  and  the company did not have any concentration of loans in one particular industry that exceeded of its total loan portfolio 
sale of loans 
the bank s residential real estate portfolio includes both conforming and non conforming residential mortgage loans

as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  an increase of  from and represented 
of total assets for the year ending december  compared to 
for the year ending december  the increase from december  was primarily due to a million increase in accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more  partially offset by a decrease in nonaccrual loans of million 
loans that are contractually past due by or more days and still accruing include well secured loans with a defined payment strategy posing minimal risk of loss to the bank

income accruals are suspended and interest previously accrued and uncollected is reversed against interest income at the time the related loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction to principal 
for each of these loans  management has evaluated the collectibility of the principal based on its best estimate of the realizable collateral value of the loans and does not anticipate that any losses from liquidation of these loans will have a material effect on future operations

allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for possible loan losses through a provision that is charged to income 
the process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of management judgment  based in part on systematic methods 
these methods  which are generally quantitative measures  are employed to help ensure that all relevant matters affecting loan collectibility will be consistently identified 
such methods at december  included a loan by loan analysis of all impaired loans and loans under close monitoring by management for potential problems  a risk rating analysis for all commercial and commercial real estate loans and a quantitative analysis of residential real estate and consumer loans 
other factors included in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involve overall loan growth  the character and mix of the loan portfolio  current trends in nonperf orming loans  delinquent loans and net charge offs  new loan origination  local economic conditions  regulatory changes and other quality considerations 
the company has a semi annual independent loan review program that supports the company s lending strategies  monitors compliance with established loan policies and procedures and identifies credit trends 
the review included all criticized and classified assets over  all loans delinquent over days and over  new closed and renewed loans over  all loans and commitments over  and a sampling of remaining commercial loans 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in nonperforming loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons that would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off  and reduced by loans charged off 
for the year ended december   the company recorded in provision expense  compared to a reduction in the allowance for loan losses resulting in a net provision benefit of  in and provision expense of  in the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated

unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than has the general level of inflation

impact of recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
servicing assets and servicing liabilities will subsequently be reported using the amortization method or the fair value measurement method 
an entity should adopt this statement as of the beginning of its first fiscal year that begins after september  with earlier application permitted with certain restrictions 
the initial application of the fair value measurement method would be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
the statement requires certain disclosures about the basis for measurement and regarding risks  activity  and fair value of servicing assets and of servicing liabilities 
the company has not yet adopted sfas no 
and is not required to do so until the company s fiscal year that begins on january  management does not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position 
sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas sfas was issued to provide consistency and comparability in determining fair value measurements and to provide for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value maintains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value but focuses on the exit price of the asset or liability 
the exit price is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability adjusted for certain inherent risks and restrictions 
expanded disclosures are also required about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the effective date is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position or res ults of operations

in september  the fasb issued sfas sfas requires companies to recognize the over funded and under funded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurred 
however  gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as of the end of  the fiscal year in which sfas is initially adopted  are to be recognized as components of the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
additionally  sfas requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date o f the company s fiscal year end statements with limited exceptions 
the company adopted sfas as of december  for its defined benefit pension plan and its post retirement benefits plan  the effects of which can be seen within note employee benefits hereof

 accounting for income taxes in order to add clarity to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
the interpretation requires that only tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon a tax examination are to be recognized in a company s financial statements to the extent that the benefit has a greater than likelihood of being recognized 
the differences that arise between the amounts recognized in the financial statements and the amounts recognized in the tax return will lead to an increase or decrease in current taxes  an increase or decrease to the deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability  respectively  or both 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early application encouraged if i nterim financial statements have not yet been issued 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab no 
addresses the diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and financial statement disclosure by considering the impact of prior year misstatements on the current financial statements 
sab requires registrants to apply the new quantification guidance to errors in existence at the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november  by correcting errors determined to be material under this new quantification method through a one tim e cumulative effect income adjustment to its beginning of year retained earnings 
upon adoption of sab  the company recorded a one time cumulative effect income adjustment to its beginning of year retained earnings of  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of sab item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
the company has no trading operations  and therefore is only exposed to non trading market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco  whose members are comprised of the bank s senior management 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies  consistent with policies established by the board of directors  which monitor and coordinate the bank s interest rate sensitivity and the sources  uses and pricing of funds 
net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates is measured through the use of a simulation model that analyzes resulting net interest income under various interest rate scenarios established by regulators 
projected net interest income nii is modeled  based on a gradual shift in market interest rates ramped over a month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and factors in projections for activity levels by product lines of the company 
assumptions are made as to the changing relationship between different interest rates as interest rates increase decrease basis risk and the customer s ability to prepay loans and withdraw deposit balances or transfer them to a higher yielding account option risk 
the sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  ass uming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the following table sets forth the estimated effects on the company s net interest income for the periods indicated and reflects such change as a percentage of projected net interest income for the subsequent month period 
interest rate sensitivity basis point rate increase basis point rate decrease december  december  the results implied in the above table indicate estimated changes in simulated net interest income for the subsequent months assuming a gradual shift in market rates up or down of basis points across the entire yield curve 
this sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
