item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout this section  our fiscal years ended december   january  and january   are referred to as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
you should review the forward looking statements and risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained herein 
overview we are a leading sporting goods retailer in the western united states  operating stores in states under the name big sporting goods at december  we provide a full line product offering in a traditional sporting goods store format that averages  square feet 
our product mix includes athletic shoes  apparel and accessories  as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports  fitness  camping  hunting  fishing  tennis  golf  snowboarding and in line skating 
we believe that over the past years we have developed a reputation with the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer as a convenient neighborhood sporting goods retailer that delivers consistent value on quality merchandise 
throughout our year history  we have emphasized controlled growth 
the following table summarizes our store count for the periods presented fiscal year big sporting goods stores beginning of period new stores stores relocated stores closed end of period stores that are relocated during any period are classified as new stores 
sales from the prior location are treated the same as sales from a closed store and thus are excluded from same store sales calculations 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
use of estimates we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles and goodwill  valuation allowances for receivables  sales returns  inventories and deferred income tax assets  estimates related to the valuation of stock options  and obligations related to asset retirements  litigation  workers compensation and employee benefits 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition we earn revenue by selling merchandise primarily through our retail stores 
also included in revenue are sales of returned merchandise to vendors specializing in the resale of defective or used products  which have historically accounted for less than of net sales 
revenue is recognized when merchandise is purchased by and delivered to the customer and is shown net of estimated returns during the relevant period 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon historical experience 
cash received from the sale of gift cards is recorded as a liability  and revenue is recognized upon the redemption of the gift card or when it is determined that the likelihood of redemption is remote and no liability to relevant jurisdictions exists 
installment payments on layaway sales are recorded as a liability  and revenue is recognized upon receipt of final payment from and delivery of product to the customer 
the company discontinued its layaway sales program in the fourth quarter of fiscal valuation of merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are made up of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
average cost includes the direct purchase price of merchandise inventory and allocated overhead costs associated with our distribution center 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories in comparison to planned sales volume and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to inventory and cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in inventory value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results if future economic conditions  consumer demand and competitive environments differ from our expectations 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be materially inaccurate at this time 
inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends 
we perform physical inventories of our stores and distribution center throughout the year 
the reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
leases we lease all but one of our store locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
certain leases have scheduled rent increases  and certain leases include an initial period of free or reduced rent as an inducement to enter into the lease agreement rent holidays 
we recognize rental expense for rent increases and rent holidays on a straight line basis over the terms of the underlying leases  without regard to when rent payments are made 
the calculation of straight line rent is based on the reasonably assured lease term as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate  sales type leases of real estate  definition of the lease term  and initial direct costs of direct financing leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
and technical bulletin no 
this amended definition of the lease term may exceed the initial non cancelable lease term 

table of contents certain leases also may provide for payments based on future sales volumes at the leased location  which are not measurable at the inception of the lease 
in accordance with sfas no 
 determining contingent rentals  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 these contingent rents are expensed as they accrue 
stock based compensation plan effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method and therefore we did not restate prior period results 
under this transition method  we began recognizing compensation expense using the fair value method for stock options granted which vested during the period 
the adoption of this method increased compensation expense by million for fiscal and reduced operating income and income before income taxes by the same amount 
the recognized tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal was million 
net income for fiscal was reduced by million  or per basic and diluted share 
prior to january   we accounted for our share based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation related to options issued to employees  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
under apb  because the exercise price of the stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations by dollar and as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands statement of operations data net sales costs of sales gross profit selling and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income premium and unamortized financing fees related to redemption of debt other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income costs of sales include cost of goods sold  buying and occupancy charges  excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately in this table 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal both fiscal years and were week periods for the company 
as a result  the following discussion of both fiscal years reflects week periods of financial information 
net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in same store sales and an increase of million in new store sales  net of sales for closed stores  which reflected the opening of new stores  net of relocations  since january  net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal included million related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage gift cards sold and store merchandise credits issued where the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
gift card breakage for fiscal totaled million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter

our gross profit for fiscal reflected the negative impact of an asset write off of million 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal store related expenses  excluding occupancy  increased by million due primarily to an increase in store count  but declined basis points as a percentage of net sales as store labor savings  due in part to merchandise delivery efficiencies provided by our new distribution center  and the ramp up in sales for fiscal  allowed leveraging of these expenses 
store related expenses in fiscal were favorably impacted by our receipt of million resulting from the settlement of a class action lawsuit relating to credit card fees 
advertising expense increased by million in fiscal due primarily to increased newspaper advertising costs  but declined basis points as a percentage of net sales 
administrative expenses for fiscal also reflect increased labor related costs of million  or basis points  to support our continuing growth and internal control initiatives and stock based compensation expense of million  or basis points  due to our implementation of sfas no 
r on january  legal and audit expense decreased by million  or basis points  in fiscal as a result of higher costs incurred in fiscal associated with the restatement of our prior period financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the higher expense was primarily due to the commencement of operations at our new distribution center  as well as the increase in store count to stores at the end of fiscal from stores at the end of fiscal other income 
in fiscal  we recorded proceeds from the settlement of a claim related to the required relocation of one of our stores  which was located on land acquired by a city redevelopment agency through eminent domain proceedings 
settlement proceeds totaled million  of which million was recorded as other income and million was recorded in selling and administrative expense primarily as a reduction in legal fees incurred in connection with this eminent domain proceeding 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates partially offset by lower average debt levels 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal and million for fiscal our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal was a week period for the company 
as a result  the following discussion of fiscal versus fiscal reflects a comparison of a week period in fiscal to a week period in fiscal exceptions to this comparison are noted where appropriate 
net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for the weeks in fiscal from million for the weeks in fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in same store sales and an increase of million in new store sales  net of sales for closed stores  which reflected the opening of new stores  net of relocations  since december  net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal also included million related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage gift cards sold and store merchandise credits issued where the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
same store sales increased for the weeks in fiscal compared with the weeks in fiscal the extra week in fiscal contributed million to net sales 
on a comparative week basis for both fiscal and fiscal  net sales increased and same store sales grew 
we are providing information regarding sales on a comparative week basis in addition to a fiscal period to fiscal period basis because of the additional week included in fiscal results 
the increase in net sales for fiscal was attributable to higher sales in each of our three major merchandise categories of footwear  hard goods and apparel 
store count at the end of fiscal was versus at the end of fiscal as we opened new stores  of which two were relocations  and closed one store 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal product selling margins for fiscal  which exclude buying  occupancy and distribution costs  increased basis points versus fiscal inventory reserve provisions  such as those for shrinkage  slow moving and returned merchandise  increased million  or basis points  from the prior year primarily as a result of the volume of returned goods inventories and related realizability of the value of these returned goods 
distribution center costs increased by million  or basis points  during the period  due primarily to the commencement of operations at our new distribution center  higher payroll related costs and increased trucking expense reflecting higher gasoline prices 
distribution center costs capitalized into inventory for fiscal increased million  or basis points  compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher costs related to our new distribution center 
store occupancy costs increased by million  or basis points  over fiscal  due mainly to new store openings 
our gross profit for fiscal reflected the negative impact of an asset write off of million 
gross profit for fiscal also benefited by million from a fourth quarter reduction of reserves related to workers compensation claims due primarily to better than expected loss experience 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase reflected a million  or basis point  increase in legal and audit fees in fiscal  due primarily to costs related to the restatement of our prior period financial statements 
this increase in legal and audit fees was partially offset by million of proceeds received from the settlement of two legal claims 
store related expenses  excluding occupancy  increased by million  or basis points  during fiscal  due primarily to an increase in store count and higher labor and benefit costs 
expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal benefited by million from a fourth quarter reduction of reserves related to workers compensation claims due primarily to better than expected loss experience 
the remaining increase was primarily a result of various higher administrative expenses in support of our overall sales growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in store count to stores at the end of fiscal from stores at the end of fiscal  as well as the commencement of operations at our new distribution center 
premium and unamortized financing fees related to redemption of debt 
premium and unamortized financing fees related to redemption of debt was zero in fiscal versus million in fiscal the million charge in fiscal resulted from a million premium paid related to the redemption of million 
table of contents face value of our senior notes and the related carrying value of applicable deferred financing costs and original issue discount which totaled million in fiscal other income 
in fiscal  we recorded proceeds from the settlement of a claim related to the required relocation of one of our stores  which was located on land acquired by a city redevelopment agency through eminent domain proceedings 
settlement proceeds totaled million  of which million was recorded as other income and million was recorded in selling and administrative expense primarily as a reduction in legal fees incurred in connection with this eminent domain proceeding 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense benefited from the redemption of million face value of our senior notes during fiscal through borrowings under our lower cost financing agreement 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal and million for fiscal our effective tax rate was for both fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we fund our liquidity requirements with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects higher net income for the year and non cash expense components of net income combined with reduced funding for working capital versus the prior year 
comparing fiscal to fiscal  the positive cash flow effect of using less cash to purchase merchandise inventories along with higher accounts payable was partially offset by a larger reduction in accrued expenses for professional fees and other expenses 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal versus fiscal primarily reflects lower net income for the year combined with higher net cash used for working capital 
comparing fiscal to fiscal  the increased use of cash for payment of accounts payable  due primarily to the timing of supplier payments  was partially offset by a reduced use of cash to purchase merchandise inventories and the effect of an increase in accrued expenses and deferred rent related primarily to our new distribution center 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures  excluding non cash acquisitions  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
the higher capital expenditures for fiscal and fiscal primarily reflect expenditures for our new distribution center 
the balance of these capital expenditures was primarily for new store openings  store related remodeling and computer hardware and software purchases 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million 
for fiscal  cash was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to prepay our outstanding term loan 
for fiscal  borrowings under our revolving credit facility increased to fund capital expenditures for our new distribution center 
for fiscal  borrowings under our financing agreement and cash provided by operations were used to pay off the company s senior notes 
as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement 
these balances compare to borrowings of million  a term loan balance of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our credit facility as of january  we prepaid million of our term loan in the second quarter of fiscal and we prepaid the remaining million of our term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we declared and paid our first ever cash dividend  at an annual rate of per share of outstanding common stock 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized 
table of contents an increase of the dividend to an annual rate of per share of outstanding common stock 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid on june   september  and december  to stockholders of record as of june   september  and december   respectively 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend  in part  on compliance with restrictions on dividends contained in our financing agreement 
future capital requirements 
we had cash on hand of million at december  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of approximately new stores  net of relocations  store related remodeling  distribution center and corporate office improvements and computer hardware and software purchases 
we believe we will be able to fund our future cash requirements for operations from cash on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures  satisfy our payments under debt obligations and pay quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to satisfy such obligations depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
see item a  risk factors included in this report 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  suspend dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to effect these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
our material off balance sheet arrangements are operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with gaap 
our future obligations and commitments as of december   include the following payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease commitments other long term liabilities revolving credit facility letters of credit total periodic interest payments on the revolving credit facility are not included in the table above because interest expense is based on a variable index  either libor or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate 
capital lease obligations consist principally of leases for our distribution center delivery trailers and management information systems hardware 
payments for these lease obligations are provided for by cash flows generated from operations or through borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our retail store facilities  distribution center and corporate office 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
with respect to most of those leases  we intend to renegotiate those leases as they expire 
other long term liabilities consist principally of an employment agreement obligation for robert w 
miller  co founder of the company  and an asset retirement obligation related to the removal of leasehold improvements from our stores upon termination of our store leases 

table of contents in april  we signed an operating lease agreement for a new distribution facility in order to facilitate our store growth 
the new distribution facility is located in riverside  california and has approximately  square feet of storage and office space 
issued and outstanding letters of credit were million at december   and were related primarily to importing merchandise and funding insurance program liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery 
because most of these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled  they are not included as outstanding contractual obligations 
financing agreement 
on december   we entered into a million financing agreement with the cit group business credit  inc and a syndicate of other lenders 
on may   we amended the financing agreement to  among other things  increase the line of credit to million  consisting of a non amortizing million revolving credit facility and an amortizing term loan balance of million 
the initial termination date of the revolving credit facility is march  subject to annual extensions thereafter 
the financing agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we prepaid million of our term loan in the second quarter of fiscal and we prepaid the remaining million of our term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal under the terms of the agreement  the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility increased by an amount equal to the repayments of the term loan 
at the end of fiscal  the financing agreement consists solely of a non amortizing million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least days prior written notice before any anniversary date  commencing with its anniversary date on march  we may terminate the revolving credit facility by giving at least days prior written notice  provided that if we terminate prior to march   we must pay an early termination fee 
unless it is terminated  the revolving credit facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on march  the revolving credit facility bears interest at various rates based on our overall borrowings  with a floor of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate 
an annual fee of  payable monthly  is assessed on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
our financing agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to create various liens and restrict the amount of capital expenditures that we may incur 
our financing agreement also restricts our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions  sell assets or pay dividends 
we may declare a dividend only if no default or event of default exists on the dividend declaration date and a default is not expected to result from the payment of the dividend and certain other criteria are met  which may include the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under our financing agreement 
if we fail to make any required payment under our financing agreement or if we otherwise default under this instrument  our debt may be accelerated under this agreement 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
in fiscal  we generated of our net sales and of our operating income in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday selling season as well as the peak winter sports selling season 
as a result  we incur significant additional expenses in the fourth fiscal quarter due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during the fourth fiscal quarter  our net sales could decline  resulting in excess inventory  which could harm our financial performance 
because a substantial portion of our operating income is derived from our fourth fiscal quarter net sales  a shortfall in expected fourth fiscal quarter net sales could cause our annual operating results to suffer significantly 

table of contents impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our earnings from operations in fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin excludes income taxes from fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and provides transitional guidance for treating differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption 
the company does not expect that fin  when adopted  will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the emerging issues task force promulgated issue no 
issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement ie  gross versus net presentation 
the task force concluded that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or a net basis based upon their accounting policy 
however  this issue states that if such taxes are significant  and are presented on a gross basis  the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed 
this issue should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  since the company currently records taxes on a net basis ie  sales tax is not included in sales  but is instead recorded as a liability under accrued expenses  the adoption of this issue will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
there are numerous previously issued statements dealing with fair values that are amended by sfas no 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
aka sab topic n addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements or  more specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab no 
does not change the sec staff s previous positions in sab no 
 materiality aka sab topic m regarding qualitative considerations in assessing the materiality of misstatements 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and would require entities to display 
table of contents the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
there are no other accounting standards issued as of march  that are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
