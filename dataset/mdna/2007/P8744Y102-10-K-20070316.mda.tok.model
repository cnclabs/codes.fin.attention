item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview steiner leisure limited is a leading worldwide provider of spa services 
we sell our services and products to cruise passengers and at resort and day spas primarily in the united states  the caribbean  the pacific  asia and mexico 
payments to cruise lines  resort spa owners and day spa landlords are based on a percentage of our revenues and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or a combination of both 
our revenues are generated principally from our cruise ship operations 
accordingly  our success and our growth are dependent to a significant extent on the success and growth of the travel and leisure industry in general  and on the cruise industry in particular 
our resort spas are dependent on the resort hotel industry for their success 
the cruise industry is subject to significant risks that could affect our results of operations 
a significant factor in our financial results is the amounts we are required to pay under our agreements with the cruise lines and resorts 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in percentages of revenues and other amounts payable by us over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resort venue operators that replace expiring agreements 
in general  we have experienced increases in these payments as a percentage of revenues upon entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
weather also can impact our results  and did so in and the multiple hurricanes that hit the southern united states and other regions in the second half of each of these years caused cancellation or disruption of certain cruises and the closure of certain of our resort spas and campuses of our massage and beauty schools  which had adverse effects on us 
in  we closed two campuses of ucmt for several days due to severe snow conditions 
in addition  the strong tsunami that hit various asian regions in december resulted in damage to  and the closing of  most of our operations in the maldives during much of other factors also can adversely affect our financial results 
an increasing percentage of cruise passengers who use our services are repeat customers of ours 
these repeat customers are less likely to purchase our products than new customers 
historically  a significant portion of our operations has been conducted on ships through entities that are not subject to income taxation in the united states or other jurisdictions 
to the extent that our non shipboard income increases as a percentage of our overall revenues  the amount of our income that will be subject to tax would increase 
we develop and sell a variety of high quality beauty products under our elemis and la therapie brands 
we also sell products of third parties 
an increasing amount of revenues have come from our sales of products through third party retail outlets  our web sites  mail order and other channels 
on april   we completed the acquisition of ucmt and a small related business 
those schools offer massage therapy programs similar to those offered by the other massage therapy schools we operate 
the purchase price for ucmt was million in cash  less cash on hand acquired 
as a result of the ucmt acquisition  we now offer post secondary degree and non degree programs in massage therapy  and  in some places  skin care and related areas at the campuses of our schools in arizona  colorado  florida  maryland  pennsylvania  nevada  virginia  and utah 
revenues from our massage and beauty schools  which consist almost entirely of student tuition payments  are derived to a significant extent from the proceeds of loans issued under the doe s title iv program and  accordingly  we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements in order to maintain the eligibility of our students and prospective students for loans under this program 
key performance indicators spa operations 
a measure of performance we have used in connection with our periodic financial disclosure relating to our cruise line operations is that of revenue per staff per day 
in using that measure  we have differentiated between our revenue per staff per day on ships with large spas and other ships we serve 
our revenue per staff per day has been affected by the increasing requirements of cruise lines that we place additional non revenue producing staff on ships with large spas to help maintain a high quality guest experience 
we also utilize  as measures of performance for our cruise line operations  our average revenue per week and our revenue per passenger per day 
we use these measures of performance because they assist us in determining the productivity of our staff  which we believe is a critical element of our operations 
with respect to our resort spas  we measure our performance primarily through average weekly revenue over applica ble periods of time 
schools 
with respect to our massage and beauty schools  we measure performance primarily by the number of new student enrollments and the rate of retention of our students 
a new student enrollment occurs each time a new student commences classes at one of our schools 
products 
with respect to sales of our products  other than on cruise ships and at our resort and day spas  we measure performance by revenues 
growth we seek to grow our business by attempting to obtain contracts for new cruise ships brought into service by our existing cruise line customers and for existing and new ships of other cruise lines  seeking new venues for our resort spas  developing new products and services  seeking additional channels for the distribution of our retail products and seeking to increase the student enrollments at our post secondary massage and beauty schools 
we also consider growth  among other things  through appropriate strategic transactions  including acquisitions and joint ventures 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
this discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed under results of operations  below  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f note that our preparation of this form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees and wages paid directly to land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa venue owners and other staff related shipboard expenses  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools  directly attributable campus costs such as rent  advertising and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa venue owners and other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in the percentages of services and products revenues and or  as the case may be  the amount of minimum annual commissions payable over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resort spa and day spa venue owners that replace expiring agreements 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount is not a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salary and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of certain intangibles relating to our acquisitions of resort spas in and ucmt in april revenue recognition tuition revenue at our massage and beauty schools and revenue related to certain nonrefundable fees and charges are recognized monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the course of study 
deferred revenue represents the portion of student tuition and nonrefundable fees and charges recorded in excess of amounts earned and certain other amounts collected in advance 
revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies are  generally  recognized when the program materials  books and supplies are delivered 
we include the revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies in the services revenue financial statement caption in our consolidated statement of income 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of the tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to our students for tuition and fees and we record a receivable for the tuition and fees earned in excess of the payment received from or on behalf of a student 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable using historical collection experience 
we review the historical collection experience  consider other facts and circumstances  and adjust the calculation to record an allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate 
if our current collection trends were to differ significantly from our historic collection experience  however  we would make a corresponding adjustment to our allowance 
we write off the accounts receivable due from former students when we conclude that collection is not probable 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over lease terms  which include renewal periods that may be obtained at our option and that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements  the value of which would be impaired by our discontinuing use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repa ir items are expensed as incurred 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  based on estimated future cash flows  that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
in certain cases  the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the assets in question 
goodwill pursuant to sfas  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and intangibles of million 
as of january   we performed the required annual impairment test and determined there was no impairment 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return for a year in question 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact fin may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
is effective for our company january  sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent report date 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
adoption of staff accounting bulletin in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior years misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
we currently use the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material as they were being evaluated under a single method in our case  the roll over method  but are material when evaluated under the dual approach proscribed by sab we adopted sab in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december  as a result of adopting sab in the fourth quarter of and electing to use the one time transitional adjustment  we made adjustments to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of january  in the fourth quarter of for the following errors stock based compensation 
in connection with our preparation of the financial statements for the year ended december   our management reviewed our history of accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result of the review  it was determined that the fair value of our common shares used to measure the intrinsic value under apb of the annual option grant to officers and other employees in was not appropriate 
as a result  an additional million of stock based compensation expense should have been recorded which would have no tax effect and which would have resulted in additional expense of million in  million in  million in and million in upon the adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of  this error was corrected as of january  through an increase in additional paid in capital of million with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings 
deferred tax accounting 
in connection with our financial reporting process for the three months ended june   we discovered that we had previously not properly considered that deferred tax liabilities created by the different treatment for book and tax purposes of our tax deductible goodwill cannot be assumed to offset deductible temporary differences which create deferred tax assets 
as a result  during the three months ended june   we recorded an additional deferred tax provision of million 
of this amount  million relates to the years through we should have recorded an additional deferred tax provision of  in   in  and  in through as a result of adopting sab in the fourth quarter  we reversed the error correction to the deferred tax provision of million initially recorded in the three months ended june  this error was corrected through a reduction of retained earnings of million and an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as of january  results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues services products total revenues cost of revenues cost of services cost of products total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses administrative salary and payroll taxes total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense other income total other income expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and equity investment provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before equity investment equity investment income from continuing operations before discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an average of four additional large spa ships in service in compared to and the number of large spa ships compared to smaller ships being greater in than in during  we operated luxury spa facilities at two hotels where we did not have operations during all of and some of our spas in the maldives that were closed as a result of the december asia tsunami reopened

r and the granting of restricted shares which were not outstanding during other income expense 
other income expense increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of  in january of insurance proceeds related to the damage we incurred as a result of the december asia tsunami and an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances in compared to provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased million from expense of million in to expense of million in provision for income taxes decreased to an overall effective rate of in from in the decrease was attributed to the recording of a deferred tax benefit of million to decrease the valuation allowance in see note in the consolidated financial statements 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the income from discontinued operations decreased million from income of million in to income of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the reversal of  of gift certificate liability in this reversal was based on an aging and redemption analysis that indicated that the likelihood of future redemption of the certificates in question was remote 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an average of eight additional large spa ships in service in compared to additionally  during we operated spa facilities at the one only palmilla  a resort in los cabos  mexico we ceased operating that spa in and at the westin rio mar beach resort in puerto rico 
the palmilla spa opened in february and the westin spa opened in november we had an average of  shipboard staff members in service in compared to an average of  shipboard staff members in service in revenues per shipboard staff per day increased by to in from in due to increased staff productivity

other income expense 
other income expense increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of all of our outstanding debt in  and an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million from expense of million in to expense of million in the provision for income taxes was an overall effective rate of in and income from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the income from discontinued operations increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase was primarily attributable to a reversal of  of gift certificate liability determined based on an aging and redemption analysis that deemed the likelihood of future redemption of the certificates in question to be remote 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth selected statements of income data on a quarterly basis for and and the percentage of revenues represented by the line items presented 
we have experienced varying degrees of seasonality  due to the seasonality experienced by certain cruise lines  resulting in the third quarter being the strongest quarter for us 
we have also experienced seasonality with respect to some of our schools  with the strongest results for these schools being in the fourth quarter 
our product sales are strongest in the fourth quarter as a result of the december holiday shopping period 
the quarterly selected statements of income data set forth below were derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure and excludes the day spa segment  which is reported in discontinued operations which  in the opinion of our management  contain all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presen tation of those statements

during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  in  we purchased ucmt and a small affiliate for approximately million  less cash on hand acquired  funding the purchase price from working capital and borrowings under our credit facility 
during the year we incurred costs of million to fund the build outs of various spas 
this was offset by the receipt of million related to the sale of certain leasehold improvements 
this sale of improvements related to the decision by kerzner hotel partners  s 
de rl  owner and operator of the one only palmilla resort in los cabos  mexico  to buy out the remaining term of our lease  effective october  as a result  as of that date we ceased to offer our services at this resort 
during the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was million  compared with million for the year ended december  included in the amount is cash used to purchase approximately million of our shares  compared with million used to purchase our shares in those payments were offset by the receipt of approximately million  representing the exercise price of common share options exercised during compared to million in we had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to working capital of approximately million at december  in august  we entered into an agreement to fund part of the build out of  and to operate  a luxury spa at the loews miami beach hotel in florida 
we estimate that our share of the build out will be approximately million and we anticipate that this luxury spa will open in april we have funded this build out from working capital 
in june  we entered into a new agreement with kerzner international bahamas limited to continue to operate the luxury spas at the atlantis and one only ocean club resorts  both on paradise island in the bahamas 
under this agreement  we will operate our spa at atlantis within a new  square foot facility currently under construction 
this new facility is anticipated to open in april we have agreed to contribute million toward the construction and fitting out of the new spa facility 
we have funded and anticipate continuing to fund this build out from working capital 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to dispose of  or otherwise close  of the day spas we then operated due to their underperformance 
the remaining day spa is located at a hotel and now operates as part of our resort spa operations 
as of april   all of those day spas had been closed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to agreements with landlords and or  in some cases  agreements with third party acquirers of the spas assets  including the leases 
some of these transactions involved our paying to those landlords amounts representing various portions of the remaining terms of the leases involved 
in the transactions involving transfers of spa assets and assignments of the leases  we typically were required to make payments to those acquirers in consideration of their assuming both the lease in question and certain gift certificate liabilities related to the spas in question 
the lease assignments to third parties generally do not include a release from the landl ords of the spas in question and  accordingly  to the extent that these third parties fail to pay rent under the leases  we remain liable for that rent 
we would  in those instances  have a cause of action for such rental amounts against those third parties 
we remain liable for approximately million as of december  under these assigned leases to the extent the assignees fail to make their rental payments 
we purchased a total of  of our common shares from february through may under our previously adopted share repurchase plan 
in june  our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional  shares 
during  we purchased  shares for a total of approximately million 
during  we purchased  shares for a total of approximately million 
all of these purchases were funded from our working capital 
there remain  shares authorized for purchase under our share repurchase plan 
we cannot provide assurance as to the number of additional shares  if any  that will be purchased under our share repurchase plan 
financing activities in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provided for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
borrowings under the term loan were used to fund our spa acquisitions and borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used for working capital needs 
we repaid all outstanding amounts due under our former term loan and the revolving credit facility in on june   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with one of the banks in the original syndicate 
the terms and conditions of the new agreement are substantially the same as the former agreement  except that there is no term loan component and the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit was increased from million to million and the maturity date of the revolving facility was extended two years to july  in  the revolving line of credit was increased to mi llion 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and bear interest primarily at london interbank offered rate libor based rates plus a spread that is dependent upon our financial performance 
as of december   there was million available under the revolving facility 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants  including limitations on dividends  capital expenditures and funded debt  and requirements to maintain prescribed interest expense and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as of december  and february   we were in compliance or had received waivers related to these covenants 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future under the credit agreement 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for the next months 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations minimum cruise line commissions operating leases employment agreements spa build outs total these amounts represent guaranteed minimum payments pursuant to cruise line agreements 
included herein are the minimum guaranteed payment obligations under certain of our resort spa leases 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation and economic conditions we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on revenues or results of operations 
however  public demand for activities  including cruises  is influenced by general economic conditions  including inflation 
periods of economic recession or high inflation  particularly in north america where a substantial number of cruise passengers reside  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry upon which we are dependent 
a recurrence of the softness of the economy in north america that occurred in recent years and over capacity in the cruise industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had a revolving line of credit in place  though we had no outstanding borrowings under that credit facility or otherwise 
to the extent we have outstanding borrowings from time to time  steiner leisure s major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives based upon market conditions 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we have used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes to its borrowings 
these swaps are typically entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby reducing the risk of credit loss 
while our revenues and expenses are primarily represented by us dollars  they also are represented by various other currencies  primarily the british pound sterling 
accordingly  we face the risk of fluctuations in non us currencies compared to non us dollars 
we manage this currency risk by monitoring fluctuations in foreign currencies and  when exchange rates are appropriate  purchasing amounts of those foreign currencies 
a hypothetical strengthening in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling to the united states dollar as of december  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
