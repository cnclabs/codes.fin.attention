the other building products services category is comprised of products such as cabinets  gypsum  roofing and insulation  and services such as turn key framing  shell construction  design assistance  and professional installation of products  spanning all of our product categories 
our operating results are dependent on the following trends  events and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control homebuilding industry 
our business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market  which is in turn dependent upon a number of factors  including interest rates and consumer confidence 
during  many homebuilders significantly decreased their starts due to lower demand and an effort to work through excess home inventory 
due to the decline in housing starts and increased competition for homebuilder business  we expect increasing pressure on our margins 
housing starts during the second half of deteriorated faster than we anticipated  and we see this challenging environment continuing through at least mid and potentially longer 
in  housing starts for our markets declined an estimated compared to the same period in many of our larger markets including texas  georgia and the carolinas experienced year over year growth during the first half of however  beginning in the third quarter the decline in housing starts was widespread affecting all our markets 
we still believe there are several meaningful trends that indicate us housing demand will likely remain healthy in the long term and that the current pullback in the housing industry is likely to be temporary 
these trends include rising immigration rates  the growing prevalence of second homes  relatively low interest rates  creative new forms of mortgage financing  and the aging of the housing stock 
targeting large production homebuilders 
in recent years  the homebuilding industry has undergone significant consolidation  with the larger homebuilders substantially increasing their market share 
in accordance with this trend  our customer base has increasingly shifted to production homebuilders the fastest growing segment of the residential homebuilders 
we expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest builders will be vital to our ability to grow and expand into new markets 
expand into multi family and light commercial business 
we believe we can diversify our customer base and grow our sales by expanding into multi family and light commercial business 
while we primarily serve the single family new home construction market  we believe we can enter the multi family and or light commercial market in certain regions with limited incremental costs as these end markets are especially conducive for sales of prefabricated components 
increasing use of prefabricated components 
homebuilders are increasingly using prefabricated components in their homes in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality 
additionally  as the homebuilders seek to control their costs in this challenging environment  we believe they will want to partner with their more value added suppliers in order to increase efficiency and improve quality in the homebuilding process 
we believe this has helped us gain market share throughout this down cycle 
in response to this trend  we have continued to increase our manufacturing capacity and our ability to provide customers with prefabricated components 
we believe the use of prefabricated components is a 
table of contents meaningful trend even though it represented a slightly smaller percentage of our total sales in when compared to this category was disproportionately affected by the housing decline as our operations in some of the weaker housing markets have a high concentration of manufactured product sales 
in addition  lower prices for commodity lumber and lumber sheet goods had a negative impact on prefabricated component sales 
expansion of existing and new facilities 
we are seeking to increase our market penetration through the introduction of additional distribution and manufacturing facilities 
in  we opened or acquired five distribution facilities and seven manufacturing facilities 
new facilities generated incremental sales of approximately million in economic conditions 
economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance 
the building products supply industry is dependent on new home construction and subject to cyclical market changes 
our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand  national and international economic conditions  labor costs  competition  government regulation  trade policies and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends  interest rates  single family housing starts  employment levels  consumer confidence  and the availability of credit to homebuilders  contractors and homeowners 
cost of materials 
prices of wood products  which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations  may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time 
we purchase certain materials  including lumber products  which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products 
short term changes in the cost of these materials  some of which are subject to significant fluctuations  are sometimes passed on to our customers  but our pricing quotation periods may limit our ability to pass on such price changes 
our inability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our operating income 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our strategy is controlling costs and enhancing our status as a low cost building materials supplier in the markets we serve 
we pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses 
we have a best practices operating philosophy  which encourages increasing efficiency  lowering costs  improving working capital  and maximizing profitability and cash flow 
we constantly analyze our workforce productivity to achieve the optimum  cost efficient labor mix for our facilities 
further  we pay careful attention to our logistics function and its effect on our shipping and handling costs 
our working capital and our selling  general and administrative expenses  both expressed as a percent of sales  have meaningfully declined since in june  we completed an ipo 
as a public company  we have significant incremental legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not have as a private company 
these include costs associated with sec rules and regulations such as periodic reporting requirements and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  nasdaq rules and regulations  and director and officer liability insurance costs 
current operating conditions and outlook fiscal began with robust housing starts  which annualized in excess of million 
our infrastructure  capital spend and staffing levels were geared to service this high level of housing activity 
we also reported record results for the first and second quarters in line with the healthy operating environment 
however  macroeconomic factors turned strongly against our industry during the second half of the year 
the year ended with housing starts slightly over million on an annualized basis  or lower than at the beginning of the year 
by the fourth quarter  housing starts for our markets decreased compared to the fourth quarter in addition  market prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods in fiscal were on average lower than when the housing market began to deteriorate  we took a number of steps to maintain profitability and conserve capital 
first  we effectively managed gross margin by continuing to migrate our product mix toward higher margin value added products and by focusing on managing prices and controlling costs 
second  we adjusted our operating cost structure as housing demand began to fall 
third  we rapidly pulled back our capital spending paring over million from our original plan 
and fourth  we focused on growing sales by upgrading our sales force and expanding into other types of business  such as multi family business 
while the homebuilding industry is currently in a down cycle  we still believe that the long term outlook for the housing industry is positive due to growth in the underlying demographics 
at this point  it is unclear if housing activity has hit bottom 
until housing demand becomes more predictable  we will manage our business day to day in order to meet customer needs 
despite the unfavorable operating conditions  we still believe we can continue to grow organically by gaining market share to outperform our underlying markets 
we also believe we can continue to increase sales through new operations at a slightly higher pace than in however  given the current market weakness  we think difficult market conditions affecting our business will continue to have a negative effect on our operating results and year over year comparisons through at least mid and potentially longer 

table of contents we believe our market leadership  financial strength and industry leading scale afford us the ability to manage through the downturn and outperform our peers 
we will continue to work diligently to achieve the appropriate balance of short term cost reductions while maintaining the expertise to grow the business when market conditions improve 
we want to avoid taking steps that will limit our ability to compete and create long term shareholder value 
seasonality and other factors our first and fourth quarters have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets  causing reduced construction activity 
in addition  quarterly results historically have reflected  and are expected to continue to reflect  fluctuations from period to period arising from the following the volatility of lumber prices  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete  the pricing policies of our competitors  the production schedules of our customers  and the effects of weather 
the composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables 
working capital levels typically increase in the second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction season 
these increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak season  which generally have been financed through our revolving credit facility 
collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have more than offset this negative cash flow 
more recently  we have relied less on our revolving credit facility due to our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows 
we believe our revolving credit facility and our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities will continue to be sufficient to cover seasonal working capital needs 
recent developments goodwill impairment one of our reporting units underperformed due to its specific business climate declining as housing activity softened and competitors gained market share 
the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit was million as of december  since december   management has closely monitored trends in budget to actual results on a quarterly basis to determine if an impairment trigger was present that would warrant a reassessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill prior to the required annual impairment test 
management has taken certain actions including  but not limited to  changing operational management  reducing the number of facilities  targeting new customers  and commencing sales of prefabricated components in this market  which inherently have higher margins 
management believes that these actions will improve operational results as similar actions have improved operational results in other markets in the past 
however  there can be no assurance that such actions will have the estimated impact 
during the three months ended september   the macroeconomic factors  primarily housing starts and market prices for lumber products  that drive the business changed significantly 
as a result of these unfavorable operating conditions  we performed an interim impairment test in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended september  based on an assessment as of september   management determined that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a million pre tax impairment charge 
fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows 
we will continue to monitor this reporting unit 
additional declines in housing activity for this and other reporting units could result in an additional impairment of the related goodwill 
acquisitions on april   we acquired the common stock of freeport truss company and certain assets and assumed liabilities of freeport lumber company collectively freeport for cash consideration of million including certain adjustments 
of this amount  million was allocated to customer relationships and million was allocated to a non compete agreement  which are being amortized over eight years and two years  respectively 
in addition  million was allocated to goodwill 
freeport is a market leading truss manufacturer and building material distributor in the florida panhandle area 
its products 
table of contents include manufactured roof and floor trusses  as well as other residential building products such as lumber and lumber sheet goods  hardware  millwork  doors and windows 
on november   we acquired the common stock of waid home center  inc waid for cash consideration of million including certain adjustments 
of this amount  million was allocated to customer relationships and million was allocated to a non compete agreement  which are being amortized over eight years and five years  respectively 
in addition  million was allocated to goodwill 
based in auburn  alabama  waid is a full line building materials supplier 
its product offerings include lumber  tools  windows  roofing  molding  paint  sheetrock and insulation 
these acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method  and accordingly the operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
under this method  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill 
pro forma results of operations are not presented as these acquisitions are not material 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
no stock based compensation was recognized under the fair value provisions for stock options in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and all years prior  as all grants under the plans had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  we will record expense for i the unvested portion of grants issued during and ii new grant issuances  both of which will be expensed over the requisite service ie  vesting periods 
we utilized the minimum value method for option grants issued prior to  and these options will continue to be accounted for under apb in accordance with sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we elected to use the short cut method allowed under fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to determine the historical pool of windfall tax benefits 
prior to  we utilized stock options for our stock based incentive programs 
as a result of sfas r  we anticipate using a combination of both stock options and restricted stock for grants under stock based incentive programs 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended december expected life years years expected volatility expected dividend yield risk free rate the expected life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding 
we consider the contractual term  the vesting period and the expected lives used by a peer group with similar option terms in determining the expected life assumption 
as a newly public company  we supplement our own historical volatility with the volatility of a peer group over a recent historical period equal to the expected life of the option 
the expected dividend yield is based on the company s history of not paying regular dividends in the past and its current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life of the options 
as a result of adopting sfas r  our results of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense of million million net of taxes 
this reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by and for the year ended december   respectively 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
financing cash inflows of million for the year ended december  represent million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and million related to the tax benefits of deductions in excess of the 
table of contents compensation cost recognized 
the excess tax benefits classified as financing cash inflows would have been classified as operating cash inflows prior to the adoption of sfas r 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to sales of certain costs  expenses and income items for the years ended december sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill income from operations interest expense  net income tax expense income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income compared with fiscal began with robust housing starts  and we reported record results in the first and second quarters 
our infrastructure  capital spending and headcount were all geared to service the high level of housing activity 
however  macroeconomic factors turned strongly against us in the second half of the year as both housing starts and commodity lumber and lumber sheet goods prices declined sharply on a year over year basis 
in  housing starts in our markets decreased approximately  and market prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods were on average approximately lower than despite the challenging operating environment  our sales decreased only as market share gains and  to a lesser extent  sales from new operations partially offset the significant decline in housing starts and market prices for commodity lumber products 
in addition  changes in our product mix were indicative of the building process 
currently  more houses are being finished than started  so lumber lumber sheet goods and prefabricated components  both of which are tied to the beginning stages of building a house  experienced a sharper decline than our other categories  which in general are more closely tied to the end of the building process 
our gross margin dollars decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and lower lumber prices 
however  our gross margin percentage improved due to favorable product mix  pricing management and lower raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a million including applicable payroll taxes special cash payment made to stock option holders in  which was partially offset by higher fuel costs as well as incremental costs related to being a public company 
sales 
sales for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease from sales of  million for the following table shows sales classified by major product category dollars in millions sales of sales sales of sales change prefabricated components windows doors lumber lumber sheet goods millwork other building products services total sales despite the sales declines experienced in prefabricated components and lumber lumber sheet goods  we estimate that we grew market share in these categories 
overall  our sales were negatively impacted by the building process  as more houses were finished than started  and falling lumber prices  as customers actively responded to market conditions 
in addition  sales of prefabricated components suffered due to the concentration of manufactured product sales in our mid atlantic and florida markets  which slowed substantially in for the lumber lumber sheet goods category  our unit volume declined 
table of contents compared to an estimated decline in housing starts in our markets while our prices declined 
this equates to million and million in sales declines due to unit volumes and price  respectively 
our other product categories benefited from the building cycle producing a favorable change in product mix 
many products in these categories are tied to the end of the building process  and therefore  did not begin to experience the full negative impact of the decreased housing starts until the fourth quarter windows doors sales also benefited from our efforts to grow our manufactured windows 
sales growth for other building products services was largely attributable to our focus on installation services 
as our homebuilder customers downsize their operations  they have increasingly utilized our turn key installation services 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or 
the gross margin percentage increased from in to in the margin expansion was primarily driven by declining procurement prices  product mix and effective pricing management  resulting in higher margins for our prefabricated components and lumber lumber sheet goods categories 
if market conditions deteriorate and create increased competitive pressure  we may not be able to maintain these margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
fiscal year included a million cash payment including applicable payroll taxes of million made to stock option holders in conjunction with our february refinancing 
this payment was made in lieu of adjusting the exercise price of their options 
excluding the impact of this payment  salaries and benefits expense was essentially flat 
we incurred an incremental million of expenses related to upgrading our fleet 
in addition  professional services fees increased million  primarily related to services required in connection with being a public company  and fuel costs increased million 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the aforementioned cash payment to stock option holders represented of the percentage 
price deflation for commodity lumber products had a negative effect in of approximately 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r increased by 
we began to implement cost saving initiatives in the third quarter however  some of these actions did not occur until late in the fourth quarter  so we did not realize the full benefit of the cost saving initiatives 
impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge related to goodwill for one of our reporting units 
interest expense  net 
interest expense was million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to prior year charges associated with our refinancing  ipo and subsequent debt repayments 
these charges are summarized below in thousands write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs financing costs incurred in conjunction with the february refinancing termination penalty resulting from prepayment of term loan under prior credit facility in addition  lower average debt levels during resulted in interest expense decreasing by approximately million 
interest income increased million due to higher cash balances 
this was partially offset by approximately million incremental interest expense due to higher interest rates 
the remainder of the decrease was due to a reduction in deferred loan cost amortization related to repayments of long term debt during the second half of provision for income taxes 
the effective combined federal and state tax rate increased from in to in compared with during  sales and gross margin grew for all product categories  as compared to  particularly for our prefabricated components product category 
in addition to favorable homebuilding activity in our geographic markets  we believe that market share gains were a primary contributor to our sales growth 
these factors were partially offset by lower prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods and capacity constraints in several manufacturing operations due to increased demand 
our sales management initiatives  including incentive and training programs  enabled us to grow sales in all product categories at a faster rate than reported growth in residential housing starts during the same period 
in addition  the growth rate for prefabricated components reflects our successful strategy of diversifying into more value added product sales 

table of contents gross margin growth was significantly offset by a million including applicable payroll taxes special cash payment paid to stock option holders in february  as well as higher selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to higher salaries and benefits  fuel costs and professional services fees 
the increase in salaries and benefits was largely due to higher sales expenses and bonuses resulting from our strong operating performance as well as increased headcount 
sales 
sales in were  million  a increase over sales of  million for the following table shows sales classified by major product category dollars in millions of of sales sales sales sales growth prefabricated components windows doors lumber lumber sheet goods millwork other building products services total sales sales of prefabricated components increased million to million in this was largely attributable to the increase in truss and panel sales of million primarily resulting from increased usage of prefabricated truss and panel components by our customers 
sales of windows doors increased million to million in this was attributable to a million increase in sales of pre assembled door units and a million increase in sales of assembled and distributed window products 
sales of lumber lumber sheet goods increased million to million in this increase was largely attributable to unit volume increases of approximately million and offset by lower pricing of approximately million 
favorable market prices for lumber during the first and fourth quarters of were offset as lumber market prices softened during the second and third quarters of sales of millwork products increased million to million in sales of exterior trim and siding increased million  and interior trim and moldings increased million 
sales of other building products services increased million to million in this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in installation services and increases in sales for gypsum  hardware  roofing and insulation products of million  million  million and million  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin was million in  an increase of million  or 
the gross margin percentage increased from in to in the gross margin percentage improved for all product categories 
gross margin percentage for prefabricated components improved from to and was the largest contributor to gross margin dollar expansion 
overall  higher sales levels  favorable product mix  lower raw material costs  improved sales management and efficiency gains drove the improvement in gross margin percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or 
in conjunction with our february  recapitalization  we made a million cash payment including applicable payroll taxes of million to stock option holders in lieu of adjusting the exercise price of their options 
during  we paid approximately million to certain stock option holders whose exercise price could not be adjusted for the february special dividend 
the remainder of the increase was largely due to a million increase in salaries and benefits expense  primarily consisting of a million increase in selling expenses  a million increase in bonuses  and a increase in headcount resulting from our strong operating performance in in addition  handling and delivery expenses increased million  primarily for fuel costs  and professional services fees increased million  primarily related to services required in connection with being a public company 

table of contents interest expense  net 
interest expense was million in  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to charges associated with our refinancing  ipo and subsequent debt repayments 
these charges are summarized below in thousands write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs financing costs incurred in conjunction with the february refinancing termination penalty resulting from prepayment of term loan under prior credit facility in addition  higher average debt levels and average interest rates during resulted in interest expense increasing by approximately million and million  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
the effective combined federal and state tax rate decreased from in to in based on our improved profitability in certain states that allowed us to realize state net operating loss carryforwards in and projected profitability in future years  we reduced the related valuation allowance by million in we also benefited from a tax deduction of approximately million provided by the american jobs creation act of for qualified production activities 
these were partially offset by an increase in certain expenses not deductible for state tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs  meet required debt payments  to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to pay dividends  if any  on our common stock 
capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  we completed our ipo in june and used the net proceeds  together with cash on hand  to repay a portion of our term loan 
based on our ability to generate cash flows from operations and our borrowing capacity under the revolver  we believe we will have sufficient capital to meet our anticipated short term needs  including capital expenditures and debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
we may also use our funds  as well as external sources of funds  for acquisitions of complementary businesses when such opportunities become available 
although we anticipate that our primary source of funds will be from operations  we have in the past and may in the future raise external funds through the sale of common stock or debt in the public capital markets or in privately negotiated transactions 
in assessing our liquidity  key components include our net income  current assets and current liabilities 
for assessing our long term liquidity  we also consider our debt and long term liabilities 
in the long term  we expect to use our existing funds and cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt and other long term obligations 
we may also use our funds  as well as external sources of funds  to retire debt as appropriate based upon market conditions and our desired liquidity and capital structure or to acquire complementary businesses when such opportunities become available 
consolidated cash flows cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily driven by changes in working capital and was partially offset by improved profitability in our working capital  primarily inventory  did not adjust as quickly as sales declined during the second half of in addition  our bonus expense and related accrual declined million from as we achieved a lower percentage of our target bonus objectives than we did in we continue to be focused on working capital management and anticipate our inventory levels will adjust downward as we react to the declining market condition 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased sales and improved profitability  but was significantly offset by a million including applicable payroll taxes special cash payment made to stock option holders in this special payment was recorded as selling  general and administrative expense in other net sources of cash were related to changes in working capital 
higher sales  accounts receivable and inventory levels were more than offset by our increased and ongoing focus on working capital management 
we have increased our accounts payable days by working with our vendors to extend our payment terms 
our accounts receivable days have decreased  and our inventory turns have increased 
in addition  our accrued liabilities increased primarily due to accrued bonus and income taxes resulting from our improved operating performance 
cash used for investing activities increased million in compared to the increase was largely due to the freeport and waid acquisitions 
a slight decrease in capital expenditures was offset by decrease in proceeds from asset sales 
when housing activity began to decline during the second half of  we responded by reducing our capital spending by approximately million from our original plan 

table of contents during and  cash used for investing activities were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures increased million from million in to million in primarily due to purchasing machinery and equipment to support increased capacity at both existing and new facilities 
proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment increased million to million in primarily due to the sale of real estate related to closed facilities and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to stock option exercises 
during and net cash used by financing activities was million and million  respectively 
significant financing transactions during and included the following in february  we entered into a senior secured credit agreement agreement and received proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds  together with cash on hand  to pay a special dividend to our stockholders of approximately million  to pay transaction costs associated with the agreement of million and to retire the existing debt facility of million 
in february  we recapitalized the company by entering into a senior secured credit agreement agreement and issuing second priority senior secured floating rate notes 
we received gross proceeds of million and million from these two transactions  respectively 
we used the proceeds  together with cash on hand  to retire million of the agreement  to pay a special cash dividend of million to stockholders  to make a special cash payment of million to stock option holders  to pay million of expenses related to the refinancing  and to pay a million early termination penalty related to the prepayment of the tranche b term loan under the agreement 
in june  we completed our ipo  and received net proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds from the ipo and cash generated from operations to repay million of our term loan under the agreement 
during the second half of  we used cash generated from operations to repay million of our term loan under the agreement 
there was no material change in book overdrafts during and compared to a decrease of million in  reflecting the timing of disbursements at period end 
capital resources on february   we entered into the agreement  which was initially comprised of a million six and a half year term loan  a million five year revolver and a million pre funded letter of credit facility available at any time during the six and a half year term 
in june  we completed our ipo and used the net proceeds as well as cash generated from operations to repay million of the term loan 
during the second half of  we repaid an additional million of the term loan 
these repayments permanently reduced the borrowing capacity under the term loan to million  eliminated the required installment payments through december  reduced the quarterly installment payments to million  and reduced the final payment to million 
at december   the available borrowing capacity of the revolver totaled million after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit under the revolver of approximately million 
we also have million of outstanding letters of credit under the pre funded letter of credit facility 
interest rates on loans under the agreement are based on the base rate of interest determined by the administrative agent rate or libor plus a margin  based on leverage ratios  which is for base rate revolving loans and for term loans  to be determined at our option at the time of borrowing 
a variable commitment fee currently based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver 
the weighted average interest rate at december  for borrowings under the agreement was 
on june   we entered into the first amendment to the agreement the amendment to ease some of the restrictive covenants related to dividends and stock repurchases 
the amendment also increased the amount of capital expenditures allowed under the agreement to million in  million in  and million per year thereafter 
the agreement is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and collateralized by i a pledge of the common stock of all our subsidiaries and ii a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible property and proceeds thereof now owned or hereafter acquired by us and substantially all our subsidiaries 
the agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  relate to the payment of dividends  incurrence of indebtedness  repurchase of common stock or other distributions  change of control  and asset sales and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
we can be required to make mandatory 
table of contents prepayments of amounts outstanding under the agreement based on certain asset sales and casualty events  issuance of debt and the results of an excess cash flow calculation that must be performed annually under the terms of the agreement 
on february   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of second priority senior secured floating rate notes due in interest accrues on the floating rate notes at a rate of libor plus and is payable quarterly in arrears 
the libor rate is reset at the beginning of each quarterly period 
at any time on or after february   we can redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to par plus a specified premium that declines ratably to par 
in the event of a change in control as defined in the indenture  we may be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we completed an exchange offer in as a result  the notes are registered under the securities act

the indenture governing the floating rate notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  incur liens  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  encounter a change of control  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us by our restricted subsidiaries and sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies 
we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to obtain a fixed rate with respect to million of our outstanding floating rate debt and thereby reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
in april  we entered into a swap agreement to fix million of our outstanding floating rate notes at an effective interest rate of  including applicable margin 
the interest rate swap agreement is for three years starting july  whereby we will pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate at day libor 
in june  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to fix million of our outstanding floating rate notes at an effective interest rate of  including applicable margin 
the interest rate swap agreement is for three years starting june  whereby we will pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate at day libor 
the interest rate swaps qualify as fully effective  cash flow hedging instruments 
therefore  the gain or loss of the qualifying cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedge transactions affect earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a receivable of million 
the weighted average interest rate at december  for the floating rate notes was  including the effect of the interest rate swaps 
long term debt consisted of the following as of december in thousands term loan floating rate notes other long term debt less current portion of long term debt total long term debt we completed construction on a new multi purpose facility during other long term debt represents an unfunded lease obligation for this facility 
for accounting purposes  we are deemed the owner 
as a result  the building and the offsetting long term lease obligation are included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of fixed assets and other debt  respectively 
the building is being depreciated over its useful life  and the lease obligation is being amortized such that there will be no gain or loss recorded if the lease is not extended at the end of the term 
capital expenditures capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors  including current and anticipated market conditions 
with the exception of  capital expenditures in recent years have remained at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods 
we believe that this trend will continue given our existing facilities  our current acquisition strategy and our product portfolio and anticipated market conditions going forward 
capital expenditures decreased slightly in compared to when housing activity began to decline during the second half of 
table of contents  we responded by reducing our capital spending by approximately million from our original plan 
we anticipate that housing conditions will continue to be difficult in as a result  we expect our capital expenditures to be lower and range from million to million 
consistent with previous spending patterns  we anticipate future capital expenditures will focus primarily on expanding our value added product offerings such as prefabricated components 
disclosures of contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes the contractual obligations of the company as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years after years long term debt operating leases interest on long term debt total contractual cash obligations interest based on libor rate of at february  interest on long term debt reflects two interest rate swap agreements effective through may actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above based on libor fluctuations 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at december  purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table because they are payable within one year 
amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
other cash obligations not reflected in the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as gaap  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet 
in addition to the lease obligations included in the above table  we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases 
under these leases we have the option of a purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term  b arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party  or c returning the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment 
if the sales proceeds in either case are less than the residual value  then we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease agreement 
the guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated million as of december  based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement  we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements 
accordingly  no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
sales 
we recognize sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize sales upon delivery to the customer s delivery site 
we use the completed contract method to recognize sales for certain construction and installation contracts 
all sales recognized are net of allowances for cash discounts and estimated returns  which are estimated using historical experience 

table of contents vendor rebates 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures  generally related to the volume of purchases from our vendors 
we account for these rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products  which reduces inventory until we sell the product  at which time these rebates reduce cost of sales 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of rebates based upon our historical level of purchases 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual purchase levels 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to product already purchased  it may impact our gross margins on products we sell or sales earned in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we generally require payment from most customers within days 
as our business is seasonal in certain regions  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months  and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
throughout the year  we record estimated reserves based upon our historical write offs of uncollectible accounts  taking into consideration certain factors  such as aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
periodically  we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
we charge these write offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at december   our goodwill balance was million  representing of our total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
examples of such indicators that would cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate  unexpected competition  significant deterioration in market share or a loss of key personnel 
we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow approach to value our reporting units 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value on a reporting unit basis has fallen below its net book value  we will compare the estimated implied value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 
inventories 
inventories consist principally of materials purchased for resale  including lumber  sheet goods  windows  doors and millwork  and raw materials for certain manufactured products and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method  the use of which approximates the first in  first out method 
we accrue for shrink based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions 
these estimates are compared with actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
during the year  we monitor our inventory levels by location and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory 
we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage  excluding special order items purchased in the last three months 
we then apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors  including liquidation value  to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value 
our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence 
deferred income taxes 
we assess whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in our assessment 
we have certain state income tax carryforwards where we believe it is unlikely that we will realize the benefits 
table of contents associated with these tax carryforwards and have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
changes in our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies will affect our estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these tax carryforwards 
insurance deductible reserve 
we have large deductibles for general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance 
the expected liability for unpaid claims falling within our deductible  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined using the assistance of a third party actuary 
this amount is reflected on our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
our accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all insurance related liabilities on a quarterly basis 
at least on an annual basis  we engage an external actuarial professional to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding  which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no stock based compensation was recognized under the fair value recognition provisions for stock options in the statements of operations for the year ended december  and all years prior  as all grants under the plans had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  we recorded expense for i the unvested portion of grants issued during and ii new grant issuances  both of which will be expensed over the requisite service ie  vesting periods 
we utilized the minimum value method for option grants issued prior to  and these options will continue to be accounted for under apb in accordance with sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
we determine the fair value or minimum value for options granted prior to of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
specific inputs to the model include the expected life of the stock based awards  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free rate 
the expected life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding 
we consider the contractual term  the vesting period and the expected lives used by a peer group with similar option terms in determining the expected life assumption 
as a newly public company  we supplement our own historical volatility with the volatility of a peer group over a recent historical period equal to the expected life of the option 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life of the options 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income tax an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while our analysis of the impact of fin is not yet complete  we do not anticipate that the implementation will have a material impact on retained earnings at the time of adoption 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer 
this issue provides that a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
if taxes subject to this issue are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amount of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
eitf is effective for us beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
we initially applied the provisions of sab in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ending december  the initial application of sab did not affect our consolidated financial statements for the year ending december  
table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the application of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience changes in interest expense when market interest rates change 
changes in our debt could also increase these risks 
we utilize interest rate swap contracts to fix interest rates on a portion of our outstanding long term debt balances 
based on debt outstanding and interest rate swap contracts in place at december   a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually 
we purchase certain materials  including lumber products  which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured products that we deliver 
short term changes in the cost of these materials  some of which are subject to significant fluctuations  are sometimes  but not always  passed on to our customers 
our delayed ability to pass on material price increases to our customers can adversely impact our operating income
