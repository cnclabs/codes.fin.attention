item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other parts of this report and other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales growth  operating results and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently known to the company 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company changes in economic  political or social conditions our profitability may be impacted by overall economic conditions  particularly in southern california 
changes in economic conditions such as inflation  employment levels  interest rates and tax rates may reduce consumer spending or influence our customers to shift their spending to our competitors 
in addition  our business may be subject to interruption from acts of terrorism  national emergencies or natural disasters 
competition in the grocery business the retail grocery business is intensely competitive with respect to price  food quality and selection  service and location 
during the past several years  there has been a consolidation in the supermarket industry 
we are in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
there are a number of well established competitors with substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than ours  some of which are also nonunion 
we frequently face the opening of a new or remodeled competitor s store in our trade area 
competition also requires us to periodically remodel our existing stores  at ever increasing costs  in order to maintain their appeal 
an inability to successfully compete with other grocery retailers in our trade areas could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability 
changes in laws or regulations or failure to comply we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and licensing requirements which regulate health and sanitation standards  food labeling and handling  the sale of alcoholic beverages  employment  working conditions  citizenship requirements and public accommodations 
changes to such laws or regulations may adversely affect our profitability by increasing our costs or affecting the sale of certain items 
in addition  we must comply with state and local fire  zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect the operation of our existing stores or could delay or prevent the opening of a new store 
changes in accounting standards  policies and practices the issuance of new pronouncements or changes to existing accounting policies and practices could have a significant impact on our reported results or change the way we account for various transactions 
new policies and changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
availability and retention of retail space we currently lease the majority of our store locations 
typically  our supermarket leases have initial year lease terms and may include options for up to an additional years 
the average term remaining on our supermarket leases  including renewal options  is approximately years 
our revenues and profitability would be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew these leases at reasonable rates 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new trade areas and to operate these stores successfully 
our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations  and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites 
we may not be able to find suitable locations that meet our demographic requirements at a reasonable cost 
the ability of our vendors to supply products and services in a timely manner our business is dependent on our ability to purchase products from a large wholesaler and numerous smaller vendors in a timely manner and at competitive prices 
the largest supplier for our stores is unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has provided product for our stores for thirty two years 
we currently procure approximately of our product from unified 
any disruption in the business of unified or any of our other principal suppliers could negatively impact our sales and profitability 
even where we have access to alternative sources of supply  the failure of a supplier to meet our demands may temporarily disrupt store level merchandise selection 
ability to control insurance coverage costs and claims experience we use a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for coverage associated with losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  fiduciary  employment practices liability  business interruption  crime  earthquake and health care 
if insurance costs increase  it could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications  cost control measures  sales increases or by improving our operating efficiency 
we are self insured for general and auto liability and  in some prior years  for workers compensation as well 
we have stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure on a per claim basis and are insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
the company devotes substantial time and effort to maintaining a safe environment in our stores  warehouse and offices 
however  the cost of both insured and self insured plans is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of premiums and our ability to manage claims 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings from time to time we are the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging injury  food quality or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former or current employees  claims concerning hazardous substances on our current or previously owned properties  class action suits concerning warning labels and other claims 
a lawsuit or claim could result in a decision against us that could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  the cost of defending ourselves against lawsuits and claims  regardless of merit  could have a negative impact on our profitability 
impact of local projects in the vicinity of our supermarkets from time to time  local events or projects take place in the vicinity of our stores that may have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 
major road construction on santa monica boulevard near our century city store began in march and was completed during the fourth quarter of at times during the project  construction occured directly in front of  or very close to  the shopping center in which our store is located 
this construction  together with a major remodel of the shopping center  resulted in a significant decline in sales and profitability for the store 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information 
new labor contracts and labor stoppages the majority of our employees belong to unions with which we have signed labor agreements which establish rates of pay  benefits and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in order to continue to attract and retain quality personnel  we may accept terms that increase our operating costs  which in turn  may negatively impact our profitability 
if contract negotiations are not successful  the union could vote to strike our stores  distribution center and offices 
the company recently completed negotiations with the ufcw to renew the contract covering the majority of our employees which expired on march  the new contract discontinues the use of a two tier wage structure and provides for  among other things  wage increases and modifications to the pension and health and welfare plans 
our new contract expires march  the ufcw has not yet reached an agreement with the three largest grocery retailers in the company s trade area 
their current agreement expires march  if the ufcw is unable to negotiate a new contract with these grocery companies  the union could vote to strike one or more of them 
the decision to strike one or more of our competitors could result in a temporary increase in sales and labor and related costs similar to what the company experienced during the labor dispute 
if the ufcw reaches an agreement with the other participating employers in our trade area under terms that are more favorable to the employers than those agreed to by gelson s  this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose labor costs are less than our own 
in addition  if the three major grocery retailers in our trade area agree to the wage rates that gelson s has negotiated under its new contract with the ufcw  then gelson s has agreed to further increase its hourly wage rate for experienced level employees by an additional 
per hour in the second and third years of the new contract 
the elimination of the two tier wage structure and increases in wage and benefit costs provided under the new contract could negatively impact the company s profitability unless it is able to offset the increased costs through a combination of sales growth  increased prices  management of labor hours and cost savings in other areas 
the company contributes to multi employer health care and pension plans for the ufcw  and therefore  the rates paid by all employers participating in the trust funds must be equal 
consequently  the benefit contribution rates that the company negotiated with the ufcw may change based on the outcome of the union s negotiations with the three major grocery retailers 
retention of key personnel our success is dependent on our key employees 
we must continue to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel including the replacement of senior management upon retirement 
individuals of this caliber are historically in short supply and this shortage may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and thus  may hinder our ability to operate effectively 
stock price volatility the market price of our class a common stock class a could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events including general economic and market conditions  variations in our earnings results  publicity regarding us and our competitors and the grocery business in general 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
furthermore  there is not a significant volume of trading in our class a which subjects our stock price to a higher level of volatility and may adversely impact the liquidity of the stock 
under the new congressionally mandated diversification requirements  stock currently held for the benefit of participants in the company s stock bonus plan could be sold which may have a negative effect on the price of class a 
fluctuations in our class a price also impact compensation expense as it relates to our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars

prior to the labor dispute  the company had agreed with the ufcw to continue operating under a contract extension and to be bound by all modifications regarding trust funds and hourly wage rates as negotiated between the ufcw and the three major grocery retailers 
in return  the ufcw agreed not to strike the company and gelson s remained open 
in a vote held on march   employees of the company who were members of the ufcw  ratified a new labor contract on terms similar to those reached by the three major grocery retailers and covering the period through march  the labor dispute resulted in a temporary shift in consumer shopping patterns and a significant increase in the company s sales and operating income during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of since the conclusion of the labor dispute  customers have returned to their previous shopping patterns
