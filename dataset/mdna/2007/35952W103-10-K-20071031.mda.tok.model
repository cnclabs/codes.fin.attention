restatement related to gross profit eliminations for intercompany inventory in addition to the adjustments related to the stock option review  the restated consolidated financial statements presented in this form k include an adjustment to correct an accounting error for the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in  as of and for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this correction relates to an error made in calculating the gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory remaining on the books of certain of our subsidiaries at period end 
the impact of the correction  net of taxes  decreased our net income by million for the quarter ended march   increased our net income by million for the quarter ended june   decreased our net income by million for the quarter ended september   decreased our net loss by million for the year ended december   increased our net loss by million for the year ended december   and increased our net loss by million for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the impact on the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in restatement related to income taxes we are also reflecting adjustments  as part of our restatement  to correct accounting errors in recording income tax expense for the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in and as of and for the year ended december  previously  we had taken the position that the foreign earnings for brc srl brc  our italian subsidiary  were permanently reinvested and therefore no residual us income tax was recorded under apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
however  for us income tax purposes  the loan from mtm srl mtm  a subsidiary of brc  to impco technologies  inc impco  our us subsidiary  entered into in december  is deemed to be a constructive dividend and therefore created taxable income that we did not previously recognize in our provision for income taxes 
for the impco loan interest payments to mtm  we are required to withhold us tax on the payments  which we did not previously withhold 
as a result  we have recorded an adjustment to increase income tax expense by million for the nine months ended september  and million for the year ended december  we also recorded an adjustment to increase income tax expense by million for the year ended december  to correct for an error in recording deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our brc operations in december  we have reflected the impact of the adjustments related to our voluntary stock option review and gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory on our income tax disclosure in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements but have also corrected this income tax disclosure for errors in our disclosure of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance by reducing both balances due to utilization of net operating loss carryovers because the loan from mtm is treated as a constructive dividend for u 
s income tax purposes  as discussed above  and due to ownership changes which took place since leading us to conclude that certain of our federal net operating loss carryovers  federal tax credit carryovers  state net operating loss carryovers and state tax credit carryovers will expire unused due to limitations imposed under internal revenue code section and in the aggregate  the reduction we recorded resulted in a reduction to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction to the related valuation reserve in the amount of million 

table of contents correction of account classification our restatement also reflects adjustments to correct for errors in account classification between selling  general and administrative expense  cost of revenue and other income expense  net 
these adjustments primarily relate to the reclassification of other manufacturing costs of foreign subsidiaries which were included in selling  general and administrative expenses instead of cost of revenue  and costs related to the closure of our cerritos facility which were classified as cost of revenue instead of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also corrected errors in classification on the balance sheet primarily between short term and long term for deferred tax balances and compensation related accrued expenses and between raw materials and finished goods 
summary the table below reflects the impact of the accounting errors that have been corrected  including the additional non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax liability and income tax impact recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing  may   through the quarter ended september   the adjustment to the gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing from january  through the quarter ended september   and the adjustment to income tax expense recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing from january  through the quarter ended september  the adjustment to correctly classify costs between selling  general and administrative expense and cost of sales have not been reflected in the table below as they represent reclassification of costs that do not have an impact on our net income  earnings per share or equity

table of contents part i item business 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems for use in the transportation  industrial and power generation industries on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas used in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for more than years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of several hundred distributors and dealers in countries and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we offer an array and combination of gaseous fuel components to assemble fuel conversion kits and systems for our customers  including fuel delivery pressure regulators  fuel injectors  flow control valves  and other components designed to control the pressure  flow and or metering of gaseous fuels  electronic controls solid state components and proprietary software that monitor and optimize fuel pressure and flow to meet manufacturers engine requirements  gaseous fueled internal combustion engines engines manufactured by oems that are integrated with our fuel delivery and electronic controls  and systems integration systems integration support to integrate the gaseous fuel storage  fuel delivery and or electronic control components and sub systems to meet oem and aftermarket requirements 

table of contents automobile manufacturers  taxi companies  transit and shuttle bus companies  and delivery fleets are among our most active customers 
additionally  users of small and large industrial engines capitalize on the lower cost and pollutant benefits of using alternative fuels 
for example  forklift and other industrial equipment users often use our products to operate equipment indoors resulting in lower toxic emissions 
the wide availability of gaseous fuels in world markets combined with their lower emissions and cost compared to gasoline and diesel fuels is driving rapid growth in the global alternative fuel industry market 
in  and  approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  was derived from sales outside the united states 
we were incorporated in delaware in after having provided automotive and alternative fuel solutions in a variety of organizational structures since reorganization on august   our company was reorganized pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization by and among impco technologies  inc impco  fuel systems solutions  inc 
fuel systems  a newly formed delaware corporation  and impco merger sub  inc  a delaware corporation formed solely for the purpose of consummating the reorganization 
the agreement reorganized impco s capital structure into a holding company structure  pursuant to which impco contributed of its holdings of the capital stock of brc srl brc to fuel systems  impco became a wholly owned subsidiary of fuel systems  and the stockholders of impco exchanged all of their shares of impco for shares of fuel systems 
nasdaq began listing fuel systems common stock on the nasdaq global market under a new trading symbol fsys on august  we believe that the reorganization  through the formation of our holding company fuel systems  with impco and brc being separate  stand alone operating entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of fuel systems  offers several advantages it promotes greater management accountability at the corporate and individual operating unit levels  it creates greater flexibility to respond to customer needs  and it aligns each operating subsidiary with specific core product lines and business segments 
as a result of this reorganization  the two market segments in which we operate are more closely aligned with our subsidiaries impco industrial segment and brc transportation segment 
as part of the reorganization  stockholders of impco received one whole share of common stock of fuel systems in exchange for every two shares of impco common stock owned at the time of the reorganization 
stockholders received cash for any fractional shares held equal to a proportionate interest in the gross proceeds of the sale on nasdaq of the aggregate fractional shares 
all outstanding warrants to purchase impco common stock became warrants to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such warrant terms  with any fractional shares treated in accordance with the warrant terms 
all outstanding options to purchase impco common stock became options to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such option  with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number 
the exercise price of the warrants and options following the reorganization became equal to twice the exercise price of such option or warrant immediately prior to the reorganization 
the post reorganization consolidated financial statements of fuel systems presented herein are presented on the same basis as and can be compared to the consolidated financial statements reported in impco s prior quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec 
all share numbers and per share amounts are stated for fuel systems and have given effect to the two for one exchange of impco stock into fuel systems stock that was effected pursuant to the reorganization 
the reorganization transaction is described in detail in the proxy statement prospectus on form s  filed by fuel systems with the sec on july  and declared effective that day

alternative fuel industry overview our business is focused on the alternative fuel industry 
we believe three independent market factors economics  energy independence and environmental concerns are driving the growth of the market for alternative fuel technology 
we believe the historic price differential between propane or natural gas and gasoline results in economic benefit to end users of alternative fuel technology 
in transportation markets  the price of alternative fuels such as natural gas or propane is typically substantially less than the price of gasoline 
by converting a liquid fueled internal combustion engine to run on propane or natural gas  customers can capitalize on this fuel price differential 
end users may recoup the cost of the conversion within six to eighteen months  depending on the fuel cost disparity prevailing at the time 
transportation companies in various countries  including italy  turkey  poland  australia  brazil and many countries in asia are also taking advantage of these economics 
in addition to economic benefits of alternative fuels to end users  some governments have sought to create a demand for alternative fuels in order to reduce their dependence on imported oil and reduce their unfavorable balance of payments by relying on their natural gas reserves 
alternative fuel vehicles that operate on natural gas or propane can lessen the demand for gasoline 
markets we are directly involved in two market segments transportation and industrial  which includes mobile and power generation equipment 
these segments have seen growth in the use of clean burning gaseous fuels due to the less harmful emissions effects of gaseous fuels and the cost advantage of gaseous fuels over gasoline and diesel fuels 
transportation according to the most recent statistics from the world lp gas association  the international association for natural gas vehicles  or iangv  and the european natural gas association  there are over million propane  or lpg  vehicles and million natural gas vehicles in use worldwide  either for personal mobility  fleet conveyance or public transportation 
as the world s vehicle population increases from million to an estimated billion by  most growth will occur in developing countries within asia  north africa  and areas of the middle east 
these regions currently have the lowest ratio of vehicles per one thousand people  and are slated to grow rapidly over the next ten years as economic improvements stimulate personal vehicle ownership 
the energy information administration of the us department of energy  the world bank  the office of economic and community development  the fifteen countries of the european union and the asian development bank suggest that interest in expanding the use of alternative fuel vehicles is mounting in many parts of the developed and developing world 
growth projections  reported by the energy information administration and the iangv in comparison with current data available from the european natural gas vehicle association  indicate that over two million additional alternative fuel vehicles will be introduced worldwide by in europe  alternative fuel vehicles have rapidly penetrated the transportation market 
the european union s four largest natural gas consuming members  the united kingdom  germany  france  and italy  all have introduced incentives for gaseous fueled vehicles 
the european union has established a target to replace of their liquid fueled vehicles with gaseous fueled vehicles by asia is emerging as a significant growth market for alternative fuel vehicles 
china  already the world s second largest energy consumer  will continue to grow in importance on world energy markets as many forecasts suggest that strong economic growth will drive up demand 
industrial equipment such as forklifts  aerial platforms  sweepers  turf equipment  power generators and other mobile industrial equipment have long been workhorses of developed countries  and are a significant portion of our global activities 
with developed countries such as the united states  and the countries in asia and europe seeking a broader consensus on regulation of emission sources in an attempt to further reduce air pollution  many countries have legislated and we believe will continue to legislate  emission standards for this type of equipment 

table of contents with new emissions regulations being imposed  oems will require advanced technologies that permit the use of gaseous fuels in order to satisfy not only the regulation  but also the customers requirements for durability  performance and reliability 
we have developed and are currently supplying a series of advanced technology alternative fuel systems to the industrial oem market under the brand name spectrum 
we and our industrial brands focus on serving the market with fuel systems  services and emission certified engine packages 
the world energy outlook projects the global primary energy demand to be over higher in compared to  an average annual rate of increase of 
even though the earth s energy resources are adequate to meet this demand  the amount of investment that will be needed to exploit these resources will be higher than in the past 
for example  the world energy outlook estimated that an investment of trillion is needed through investment in the oil industry will also have to rise sharply  as demand rises and the surplus capacity in crude oil production and refining that has characterized the industry since the s is completely used 
approximately of the increase in gas demand is expected to come from the power generation sector  and from the industrial sector  since natural gas is relatively more efficient compared to other energy sources and since it burns more cleanly than either coal or oil 
worldwide energy consumption of the industrial sector is expected to grow by annually compared to annual expected growth in population over the period  according to us department of energy s international energy outlook the natural gas share of world energy consumption on a btu basis is expected to rise from to 
gaseous fuels such as propane and natural gas have significant reserves available worldwide which are less costly to refine compared to crude oil and have historically been less expensive than liquid fuels 
according to the us geological survey s world petroleum assessment  a significant volume of natural gas remains to be discovered 
china and india  the world s most heavily populated nations  are actively developing their infrastructure to facilitate natural gas consumption and imports 
competitive advantages industry participants compete on price  product performance and customer support

table of contents sales and distribution we sell products through a worldwide network encompassing several hundred distributors and dealers in over countries and through a sales force that develops sales with distributors  oems and large end users 
our operations focus on oem and aftermarket distributors in the transportation  industrial  and power generation markets 
of these markets  we believe that the greatest potential for immediate growth is in the europe and asia pacific regions in the transportation oem and aftermarket  and in north america in the industrial oem and aftermarket 
during years  and  sales to distributors accounted for  and  respectively  of our net revenue  and sales to oem customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net revenue 
distributors generally service the aftermarket business for the conversion of liquid fueled engines to gaseous fuels and small volume oems are generally specialized and privately owned enterprises 
many domestic distributors have been our customers for more than years and many of our export distributors have been our customers for more than years 
our impco operations  consisting of our us facility and foreign subsidiaries located in the netherlands  australia and japan  as well as our brc operations  consisting of our italian facility and foreign subsidiaries in argentina and brazil  have sales  application  market development and technical service capabilities 
information regarding revenue  income and assets of each of our two business segments  impco operations and brc operations  and our revenue and assets by geographic area is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing we manufacture and assemble a majority of our products at our facilities in santa ana  california  and cherasco  italy and to a lesser extent at some of our other international facilities 
current manufacturing operations consist primarily of mechanical assembly and light machining 
we rely on outside suppliers for parts and components and obtain components for products from a variety of domestic and foreign automotive and electronics suppliers  die casters  stamping operations  specialized diaphragm manufacturers and machine shops 
in  and  power solutions  inc accounted for approximately  and of our raw material purchases  respectively 
material costs and machined die cast aluminum parts represent the major components of cost of sales 
coordination with suppliers for quality control and timely shipments is a high priority to maximize inventory management 
we use a computerized material requirement planning system to schedule material flow and balance the competing demands of timely shipments  productivity and inventory management 
our california and italy manufacturing facilities are iso certified

our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
competition our key competitors in gaseous fuel delivery products  accessory components and engine conversions markets include landi group  lovato company  omvl  srl and srl tartarini  srl located in europe  aisan industry co 
ltd 
and nikki company ltd 
in japan and teleflexgfi in the north america and europe 
these companies  together with us  account for a majority of the world market for alternative fuel products and services 
in the future  we may face competition from traditional automotive component suppliers  such as the 
table of contents bosch group  delphi corporation  siemens vdo automotive ag  and visteon corporation  and from motor vehicle oems that develop fuel systems internally 
industry participants compete on price  product performance and customer support 
product certification we must obtain emission compliance certification from the environmental protection agency to sell certain of our products in the united states  from the california air resources board to sell certain products in california  and meet european standards for emission regulations in that market 
each car  truck or van sold in the market must be certified before it can be introduced into commerce  and its products must meet component  subsystem and system level durability  emission  refueling and various idle tests 
we have also obtained international emissions compliance certification in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  chile  europe  russia  mexico and thailand 
we strive to meet stringent industry standards set by various regulatory bodies 
approvals enhance the acceptability of our products in the worldwide marketplace 
many foreign countries also accept these agency approvals as satisfying the approval for sale requirements in their markets 
employees as of august   we employed approximately persons  excluding those employed by our unconsolidated affiliate in brazil  italy and south korea 
of these employees  were employed in impco operations  of which are foreign employees  and were employed in brc operations 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
intellectual property we currently rely primarily on patent and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have four us patents and four italian patents issued 
our us patents will expire on various dates through october  and our italian patents will expire on various dates until april we do not expect the expiration of our patents to have a material effect on our revenue 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights provide sufficient protection from competition 
we believe that our intellectual property protected by copyright  trademark and trade secret protection is less significant than our intellectual property protected by patents 
third parties may claim that our products and systems infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
identifying third party patent rights can be particularly difficult  especially since patent applications are not published until months after their filing dates 
if a competitor were to challenge our patents  or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial litigation costs  be forced to design around their patents  pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations  any of which could be expensive and or have an adverse effect on our operating results 
third party infringement claims  regardless of their outcome  would not only drain our financial resources  but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation 
item a 
risk factors 
we currently have substantial debt that we may be unable to service 
we have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of million not including debt obligations for impco from brc of approximately million under a loan agreement with mtm srl the mtm loan  which have been eliminated in consolidation 
the impco us operations lasalle senior credit facility has a maximum borrowing limit of million  which was limited based on our eligible accounts receivable and our eligible inventory as of december  to approximately million 
of that amount  million was outstanding as of december   leaving approximately million unused and available 
our debt subjects us to numerous risks  including the following we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt  thereby reducing cash available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances  and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents our leverage may increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors who are less leveraged  our debt service obligations may limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate  our level of debt may make it difficult for us to raise additional financing on terms satisfactory to us  and if we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments  any such failure could  if not cured or waived  have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill our obligations and on our business or prospects generally  including the possibility that our lenders might foreclose on our assets 
we have recently been in default under our impco us operations primary debt facility  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to avoid events of default or noncompliance in the future or to obtain amendments to our debt facilities 
the impco us operations lasalle senior credit facility requires us to present it with accurate and timely financial reports 
due to the delay in preparing the current and restated historical financial statements included in this annual report on k for and the quarterly reports for the first two quarters of  we have been in breach of this requirement 
in addition  the lasalle senior credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specific financial tests  such as requiring us to generate specified amounts of pre tax income 
our recurring failure to comply with these covenants has resulted in defaults for which we have had to seek numerous waivers and amendments to our credit facility 
if we are unable to secure any necessary future waivers or amendments  lasalle could require us to repay the amounts owed under the credit agreement immediately 
if we are unable to make a required repayment and are not able to draw sufficient dividends or loans from our subsidiaries or refinance these borrowings  our lenders could foreclose on our assets and our business could be adversely impacted 
we cannot assure investors that the lenders will continue to agree to amend the financial covenants or grant further or continuing waivers in the future 
in addition  amendments or waivers may be on terms that are different from and more onerous to us than the current terms of the senior credit facility 
for example  in connection with granting us recent waivers  lasalle has required that we make no payments to mtm under the loan between impco and mtm 
in order to avoid defaulting on the mtm loan  we have had to borrow additional principal amounts from mtm and use the additional indebtedness to make the required debt service payments 
our senior credit facility with lasalle expires on january  we might not be able to extend the maturity of the lasalle senior credit facility  and we would have to draw dividends from our subsidiaries or refinance our indebtedness in order to repay the amounts owing under it 
impco us operations has historically depended on borrowings under our lasalle senior credit facility to fund our liquidity and capital needs 
as of september   the outstanding principal amount under the credit facility was million 
this credit facility expires on january  la salle has indicated its intent to not renew our credit facility in the long term and they may or may not be willing to extend beyond that date while we transition to a new lender 
if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing by the expiration of the lasalle senior credit agreement  we would have to draw dividends or obtain loans from our subsidiaries to repay the amounts owing or refinance the debt 
our ability to find replacement financing is hampered by the long delay in filing this annual report on form k for and the quarterly reports on form q for the first two quarters of  and our need to present the consolidated financial statements contained in these periodic reports to prospective lenders as part of the loan application process 
as a result  we may not be able to secure a new credit facility on terms that are favorable to us before the expiration of the lasalle senior credit facility and may not be able to secure a new credit facility by that time  if at all 
if we cannot repay the amounts owning under the lasalle senior credit facility  or if the company cannot obtain the necessary waivers or amendments  or return to compliance with the lasalle covenants and all other loan covenants  the company s lenders may foreclose on certain of our assets or take other legal action against us that  alone or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents the terms of our debt may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
our debt agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our operations 
among other things  these restrictions limit our ability to change our chief executive officer  incur liens or make negative pledges on our assets  merge  consolidate  or sell our assets  incur additional debt  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or prepay other debt  make investments and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  or amend our debt instruments and certain other material agreements 
mariano costamagna and pier antonio costamagna have guaranteed our performance under the mtm loan and  in connection with those guarantees  we have pledged our brc equity interest and made certain other concessions to them 
because of certain requirements arising under italian law  mariano costamagna our chief executive officer and pier antonio costamagna director of mechanical engineering of mtm srl mtm  whom we refer to as founders of brc  have jointly and severally guaranteed impco s performance under the mtm loan 
in order to secure their recourse in the event that guaranty is exercised and the founders are required to make payments of the amounts due  we have pledged to the founders our entire interest in brc 
if impco fails to perform the terms of the mtm loan and the founders are required to fulfill their guarantees  the founders may require us to reimburse them for their payments as guarantors  or they may take possession of our equity interest in brc  or both 
if the founders were to take possession of the brc equity interest in total or partial satisfaction of their rights under the pledge agreement  we would lose our rights to participate in brc s earnings and assets 
this would have a material adverse effect upon our earnings and our assets 
the terms of the mtm loan requires impco to repay mtm the principal according to the following schedule  with a million balloon payment of accrued interest and unpaid principal due on december  quarters ending quarterly payment amount payment per year december  paid in january january  through december  january  through december  january  through december  balloon payment due december  total payments the internal review of our historical stock option granting practices  the restatement of certain of our historical consolidated financial statements  investigations by the sec and related events have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
on march   fuel systems announced that a special committee of its board of directors  with the assistance of independent legal counsel  was conducting a review of our stock option practices covering the period from to as described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item  and in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  the special committee reached a conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods 
as a result  we have recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related tax effects  related to certain stock option grants  and we have restated certain previously filed consolidated financial statements included in this form k 

table of contents the stock option grant review and related activities have resulted in substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  have diverted management s attention from the day to day business  and could in the future harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct revised measurement dates for our historical stock option grants and have appropriately corrected for the other option accounting errors that have been identified  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact 
accordingly  there is a risk we may have to further restate prior consolidated financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the stock option grant review and restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
we are unable to predict what action  if any  the sec  or other regulatory bodies may pursue or what consequences such an action may have on us 
we are also unable to predict the likelihood of or potential outcomes from litigation  other regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  if any  relating to our past stock option practices and the need to restate our historical consolidated financial statements 
the resolution of these matters could be time consuming and expensive  further distract management from other business concerns and harm our business 
furthermore  if we were subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could harm our business and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet the appropriate deadlines or extended deadlines for our sec filings in the future which results in our inability to use short form registration statements 
we filed our annual sec reports late in each of the last four years 
we have also filed several of our quarterly reports late during this period 
while we have ultimately filed some of those reports under extended deadlines  others we have not 
our form k for the year ended december  and our forms q for the periods ended march  and june  were significantly delayed due to our voluntary review of historical stock option grants 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet the appropriate deadlines or extended deadlines for our sec filings in the future 
as a result of our late filings  we are currently unable to file short form registration statements if we were to issue additional securities to the public  thereby increasing the cost of any securities issuances that we might consider 
furthermore  additional delays in our filings could jeopardize our common stock s listing status on the nasdaq stock market 
if we do not comply with the requirements of the nasdaq stock market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
we have received letters from the staff of the nasdaq stock market stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of this form k  our march  form q and our june  form q  we are subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market 
to date  nasdaq has granted an exception to the listing requirement  pending further review  and subject to us filing our delinquent reports by specified dates 
with the filing of this report and the filing of our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march  and june   we believe that we have remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c 
however  there can be no assurance that the listing council will decide to allow our common stock to remain listed on nasdaq stock market 
in addition  if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for the financial impact of past stock option grants  we could experience further delays in filing subsequent sec reports that could result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq stock market 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock market  it would subsequently trade on the pink sheets which may reduce the price of the our common stock and the liquidity available to our stockholders 
in addition  the trading of our common stock on the pink sheets would materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets  and the limited liquidity and potentially reduced price of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to the company or at all 

table of contents we have a history of significant cash outflows that may limit our ability to grow and may materially and adversely impact our prospective revenue and liquidity 
we have experienced net cash outflows 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million and our working capital was million 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million and our working capital was million 
we have experienced significant cash outflows as a result of building inventory levels to reduce lead time 
based upon our eligible accounts receivable and our eligible inventory as of december   our funds available for borrowing under our senior secured credit facility were approximately million  of which approximately million was outstanding  leaving approximately million unused and available 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
if adequate funds are no longer available or are no longer available on acceptable terms  our ability to grow may be limited which may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies in general and our company in particular have a history of depending upon and using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  to motivate and to retain employees in a competitive marketplace 
we did not previously recognize compensation expense for stock options issued to employees or directors  except in limited cases involving modifications of stock options 
we instead disclosed in the notes to our financial statements information about what such charges would be if they were expensed 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  adopted a new accounting standard that required us to record equity based compensation expense for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
we recorded these expenses beginning with our first quarter of  as required  and recorded approximately million in compensation expense for the year ended december  the change in accounting rules increases reported net loss or  when we are profitable  decreases reported earnings 
this may negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  this change in accounting rules could impact the likelihood of our using broad based employee stock option plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
however  we have not issued any stock options to employees since and  in  our board of directors adopted a new bonus incentive plan that authorizes cash and restricted stock awards to employees  but does not authorize stock option awards 
we are dependent on certain key customers  and the loss of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a substantial portion of our business results from sales to key customers 
in the year ended december   no one customer exceeded of our consolidated sales 
sales to our top ten customers during the year ended december  accounted for approximately of our consolidated sales 
in  nacco materials handling group represented approximately of our consolidated sales 
no other customer represented more than of our consolidated sales in sales to the top ten customers during accounted for approximately of our consolidated sales 
if several of these key customers were to reduce their orders substantially  we would suffer a decline in revenue and profits  and those declines could be material and adverse 
mariano costamagna s employment agreement and the terms of the mtm loan may limit our board of directors ability to effect changes in our senior management 
mariano costamagna  brc s co founder  our director  chief executive officer and president  has entered into an employment agreement which is effective until may  mariano costamagna s employment agreement provides for an initial base salary of  annually  as well as bonuses  benefits and expenses 
if  during the term of his employment  we terminate mr 
costamagna s employment other than for cause  or if mr 
costamagna resigns for good reason  we must pay mr 
costamagna a severance payment equal to million subject to certain limited reductions if mr 
costamagna sells more than of the stock he has received in connection with our acquisition of brc 
the required severance payment may limit our board of directors ability to decide whether to retain or to replace mr 
costamagna or to reallocate management responsibilities among our senior executives  a fact that may  in certain circumstances  have an adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
moreover  the loan to us from mtm can be accelerated in the event that mr 
costamagna s employment is terminated for any reason with limited exceptions for termination upon mr 
costamagna s death or if we otherwise materially breach his employment agreement 

table of contents we depend on third party suppliers for key materials and components for our products 
we have established relationships with third party suppliers that provide materials and components for our products 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  combined with a delay in our ability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  would harm our ability to manufacture our products or would significantly increase our production costs  either of which would negatively impact our results of operations and business 
in addition  we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain proprietary die cast parts  electronics  software  catalysts as well as engines for use in our end products 
in the year ended december   power solutions  inc supplied approximately of our raw materials  as compared to in approximately and of our raw materials during the year ended december  and  respectively  were supplied by ten entities 
we could incur significant costs in the event that we are forced to utilize alternative suppliers 
we may experience unionized labor disputes at original equipment manufacturer facilities 
as we become more dependent on vehicle conversion programs with oems  we will become increasingly dependent on oem production and the associated labor forces at oem sites 
for and  direct oem product sales accounted for and of impco s revenue  respectively 
labor unions represent most of the labor forces at oem facilities 
in the past  labor disputes have occurred at oem facilities which adversely impacted our direct oem product sales 
such labor disputes are likely to occur in the future and  if so  will negatively impact our sales and profitability 
we face risks associated with marketing  distributing  and servicing our products internationally 
in addition to the united states  we currently operate in italy  australia  the netherlands  japan  brazil and argentina  and market our products and technologies in other international markets  including both industrialized and developing countries 
during and  approximately and of our revenue  respectively  was derived from sales to customers located within the united states and canada  and the remaining and  respectively  was derived from sales in asia  europe  and latin america where economics and fuel availability make our products more competitive 
additionally  approximately of our employees and of our approximately distributors and dealers worldwide are located outside the united states 
our combined international operations are subject to various risks common to international activities  such as the following our ability to maintain good relations with our overseas employees and distributors and to collect amounts owed from our overseas customers  expenses and administrative difficulties associated with maintaining a significant labor force outside the united states  including without limitation the need to comply with employment and tax laws and to adhere to the terms of real property leases and other financing arrangements in foreign nations  exposure to currency fluctuations  potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations  including product certification  environmental  and import and export laws  the challenges of operating in disparate geographies and cultures  political and economic instability  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries  and difficulties collecting international accounts receivable 

table of contents adverse currency fluctuations may hinder our ability to economically procure key materials and services from overseas vendors and suppliers  may affect the value of our debt  and may affect our profit margins 
we have significant operations outside of the united states 
as a result  we engage in business relationships and transactions that involve many different currencies 
exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in these foreign locations where we do business can vary unpredictably 
these variations may have an effect on the prices we pay for key materials and services from overseas vendors in our functional currencies under agreements that are priced in local currencies 
if exchange rates with local currencies decline  our effective costs for such materials and services would increase  adversely affecting our profitability 
operating cash balances held at non us banks which were of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  are not federally insured and therefore may pose a risk of loss to us 
our financial results are significantly influenced by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
brc recognized approximately a million unrealized loss and a million unrealized gain as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates during and  respectively  in connection with mtm s five year million loan agreement with impco that is denominated in us dollars 
of the approximately million unrealized gain for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in other income for the nine months ended december  and approximately million  which related to our share of the earnings of brc prior to our acquisition of the second of brc on march   in equity share in income of unconsolidated affiliates 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the future could impact the financial results and cause net income and earnings per share to decline dramatically 
we may be unable to effectively hedge our exposure to this risk or significantly reduce our foreign exchange risk 
brc entered into a three year foreign exchange forward contract on january  for the purpose of hedging the quarterly payments being made by impco to brc under the mtm loan leaving million unhedged 
however  we determined that the foreign exchange forward contract did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we recognize the gains and losses in fair value of these agreements from fluctuations between the euro and us dollar in other income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
in and  brc recognized approximately million income and million expense  respectively  as an adjustment to the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contract 
we derive income from unconsolidated foreign companies that we do not control 
we may never realize any value from our investment in our unconsolidated foreign subsidiary wmtm equipamento de gases ltd wmtm  and wmtm may be unable to pay on amounts owed to our consolidated subsidiary mtm for the purchase of components or its loan owing to us 
beginning april  and subsequent to the acquisition of brc  we recognize of the earnings and losses of wmtm equipamentos de gases  ltda  a brazilian joint venture with an american partner  and of the earnings and losses of mte  srl  an italian company 
a portion of our income is generated from the operations of these unconsolidated foreign subsidiaries in which we hold interests 
although the agreements that govern our relationships with these entities provide us with some level of control over our investments  we do not have the ability to control their day to day operations or their management 
as a result  we cannot control these entities ability to generate income 
wmtm s losses over the period of our investment have exceeded the amount of our investment in wmtm 
in addition  our consolidated subsidiary mtm sells components to wmtm  and the total amount owed by wmtm to mtm as of december  was approximately million which was past due as of that date 
moreover  we extended the maturity date on our loan to wmtm million at december  of which we have reserved million from january  to january  as of december   amounts due to us by wmtm aggregated to million of which million was past due 
we may never realize any value from our investment in wmtm  and wmtm may be unable to pay amounts owed to mtm for the purchase of components or its loan owing to us 
we are highly dependent on certain key personnel 
we are highly dependent on the services of mariano costamagna  our chief executive officer  and marco seimandi  brc s marketing director 
these two executives are extensively involved in  or directly or indirectly oversee  virtually every aspect of our day to day operations 
were we to lose the services of either of these executives  we would face a significant risk of declining revenue and or operating income 
moreover  the loan to impco from mtm can be accelerated in the event that mariano costamagna is terminated by us for any reason  with certain limitations for termination occasioned by his death or if we materially breach his employment agreement 

table of contents we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our securities 
our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  arising from a combination of internal control deficiencies with respect to the period end financial close  accounting for our investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures and revenue recognition processes of our italian subsidiary  in our stock administration policies and practices  and in our period end financial close process as discussed in management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item a 
in addition  due to the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of december  our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
specifically  our management has identified the following material weaknesses we did not maintain effective internal control over the financial close process at brc  our italian subsidiary and brc did not have an adequate number of accounting and finance personnel with sufficient technical expertise in us gaap 
as a result  brc did not have effective procedures to evaluate  analyze and review the financial information submitted by its consolidated and unconsolidated foreign operations and management and our independent auditors identified some control deficiencies and errors relating to revenue recognition and accounting for our investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 
we have determined that these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses in controls at brc 
we did not maintain effective oversight controls to timely review and detect errors with regard to the accounting for certain historical stock option grants  which resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
accordingly  management has determined that this control deficiency represents a material weakness 
we did not maintain effective internal control over the period end financial close process  including but not limited to the elimination of intercompany profit in the consolidation of our consolidated financial statements and the determination of income tax expense and the related deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that this control deficiency represents a material weakness 
we will continue to evaluate  upgrade and enhance our internal controls 
because of inherent limitations  our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  errors or omissions 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
we cannot be certain in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more significant deficiencies as defined by the relevant auditing standards or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments  we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls or meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our securities 
moreover  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
through the year ended december   we expended significant resources in connection with the section process 
in future periods  we will likely continue to expend substantial amounts in connection with the section process and with ongoing evaluation of  and improvements and enhancements to  our internal control over financial reporting 
these expenditures may make it difficult for us to control or reduce the growth of our general and administrative and other expenses  which could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our securities 

table of contents our business is directly and significantly affected by regulations relating to vehicle emissions 
if current regulations are repealed or if the implementation of current regulations is suspended or delayed  our revenue may decrease 
in addition  we rely on emissions regulations  the adoption of which is out of our control  to stimulate our growth 
if regulations relating to vehicle emissions are amended in a manner that may allow for more lenient standards  or if the implementation of such standards is delayed or suspended  the demand for our products and services could diminish and our revenue could decrease 
in addition  demand for our products and services may be adversely affected by the perception that emission regulations will be suspended or delayed 
we are subject to certification requirements and other regulations  and future more stringent regulations may impair our ability to market our products 
we must obtain product certification from governmental agencies  such as the epa and the california air resources board  to sell certain of our products in the united states  and must obtain other product certification requirements in italy and other countries 
a significant portion of our future sales will depend upon sales of fuel management products that are certified to meet existing and future air quality and energy standards 
we cannot assure you that our products will continue to meet these standards 
the failure to comply with these certification requirements could result in the recall of our products or civil or criminal penalties 
any new government regulation that affects our alternative fuel technologies  whether at the foreign  federal  state  or local level  including any regulations relating to installation and service of these systems  may increase our costs and the price of our systems 
as a result  these regulations may have a negative impact on our revenue and profitability and thereby harm our business  prospects  results of operations  or financial condition 
declining oil prices may adversely affect the demand for our products 
we believe that our sales in recent periods have been favorably impacted by increased consumer demand promoted by rising oil prices 
further reductions in oil prices may occur  and demand for our products could decline in the event of fluctuating  and particularly decreasing  market prices 
changes in tax policies may reduce or eliminate the economic benefits that make our products attractive to consumers 
in some jurisdictions  such as the united states and australia  governments provide tax benefits for clean air vehicles  including tax credits  rebates and reductions in applicable tax rates 
in certain of our markets these benefits extend to vehicles powered by our systems 
from time to time  governments change tax policies in ways that create benefits such as those for our customers 
reductions or eliminations in these benefits may adversely affect our revenue 
the potential growth of the alternative fuel products market will have a significant impact on our business 
our future success depends on the continued global expansion of the gaseous fuel industry 
many countries currently have limited or no infrastructure to deliver natural gas and propane 
major growth of the international markets for gaseous fuel vehicles is significantly dependent on international politics  governmental policies and restrictions related to business management 
in the united states  alternative fuels such as natural gas currently cannot be readily obtained by consumers for motor vehicle use and only a small percentage of motor vehicles manufactured for the united states are equipped to use alternative fuels 
users of gaseous fuel vehicles may not be able to obtain fuel conveniently and affordably  which may adversely affect the demand for our products 
we do not expect this trend to improve in the united states in the foreseeable future 
our ability to attract customers and sell products successfully in the alternative fuel industry also depends significantly on the current price differential between liquid fuels and gaseous fuels 
we cannot assure you that the global market for gaseous fuel engines will expand broadly or  if it does  that it will result in increased sales of our fuel system products 
in addition  we have designed many of our products for gaseous fuel vehicles powered by internal combustion engines  but not for other power sources  such as electricity or alternate forms of power 
if there is major growth in the market relating to those power sources  our revenue may not increase and may decline 

table of contents we currently face and will continue to face significant competition  which could result in a decrease in our revenue 
we currently compete with companies that manufacture products to convert liquid fueled internal combustion engines to gaseous fuels 
increases in the market for alternative fuel vehicles may cause automobile or engine manufacturers to develop and produce their own fuel conversion or fuel management equipment rather than purchasing the equipment from suppliers such as us 
in addition  greater acceptance of alternative fuel engines may result in new competitors 
should any of these events occur  the total potential demand for our products could be adversely affected and cause us to lose existing business 
new technologies could render our existing products obsolete 
new developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete 
our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies  conform to increasingly stringent emission standards and performance requirements  and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position 
new product development or modification is costly  involves significant research  development  time and expense  and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products 
we have a significant amount of intangible assets that may become impaired  which could impact our results of operations 
approximately million or of our total assets at december  were net intangible assets  including technology  customer relationships  trade name  and approximately million or of our total assets at december  were goodwill that we acquired primarily from brc 
we amortize the intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  based on our estimate of their remaining useful lives and their values at the time of acquisition 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis  or earlier if we determine it may be impaired due to change in circumstances 
we are required to test the other intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment exists in any of these assets  we are required to write down the asset to its estimated recoverable value as of the measurement date 
such impairment write downs may significantly impact our results of operations 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
substantial sales of our common stock  including shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants  in the public market or the perception by the market that these sales could occur  could lower our stock price or make it difficult for us to raise additional equity 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  excluding  shares issued but held by us as treasury stock 
except for the  shares held by mariano costamagna and his family members and affiliates which are subject to the volume  manner of sale and other selling restrictions of rule  all of these shares are currently freely tradable 
as of december  up to  shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding as of that date 
furthermore  as of december   up to  shares were issuable upon the exercise of options  of which  were vested and exercisable 
subject to applicable vesting and registration requirements  upon exercise of these options the underlying shares may be resold into the public market 
in the case of outstanding options and warrants that have exercise prices less than the market price of our common stock from time to time  investors would experience dilution 
we cannot predict if future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for sale  will harm the market price of our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
from january  through december   our stock price has fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
during the weeks ended december   our stock price fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 

table of contents our business is subject to seasonal influences 
operating results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year 
in particular  net sales and operating income in europe and the united states are typically lower during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
many of the factors which impact our operating results are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
they include seasonal work patterns due to vacations and holidays  particularly in our european manufacturing facilities  and fluctuations in demand for the end user products in which our products are placed

closure and liquidation of operations in mexico in the fourth quarter of  we decided to liquidate our mexico joint venture ibmexicano and agreed with our joint venture partner to wind down that business 
we continue to sell in the mexico market through independent distributors 
as a result  in we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a write off our investment in ibmexicano

as a result  during we recorded approximately million in additional inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful trade and related party receivables 
item legal proceedings 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
we are not a party to  and to our knowledge there are not threatened  any claims or actions against us  the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us 
mtm is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by icom  srl  filed in the local court at milan  italy 
that lawsuit initially sought injunctive relief and damages for infringement of icom s alleged exclusive rights to sell ring style gaseous fuel tanks in italy 
the trial court initially denied the plaintiff s motion for injunctive relief and subsequently denied the plaintiff s damages claims 
the case remains on appeal with the final hearing scheduled on march   we believe the plaintiff s claims are without merit

these statements represent projections  beliefs and expectations based on current circumstances and conditions and in light of recent events and trends  and you should not construe these statements either as assurances of performances or as promises of a given course of action 
instead  various known and unknown factors are likely to cause our actual performance and management s actions to vary  and the results of these variances may be both material and adverse 
a list of the known material factors that may cause our results to vary  or may cause management to deviate from its current plans and expectations  is included in item a risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 
restatement related to voluntary stock options grant review background in march  our board of directors created a special committee to conduct a voluntary  internal review of the company s historical stock option grant practices and related accounting 
the review covered options granted during the period from january through december the review period 
there were no option grants during and the special committee retained outside counsel and accounting experts to assist with this review 
on july   although the special committee had not yet completed its review  the special committee preliminarily concluded that different measurement dates should have been used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants 
at that time  the company announced that it was more likely than not that the company will need to restate historical financial statements to recognize non cash stock based compensation expense 
accordingly  the company concluded that the company s previously issued consolidated financial statements and the related reports or interim reviews of its independent registered public accounting firm  and all earnings press releases and similar communication issued by the company  should not be relied upon 
scope of the independent investigation the special committee retained outside counsel and accounting experts to assist with this stock option review which included the search and retrieval of electronic data from the company s computer and backup storage systems  review of reasonably available relevant physical and electronic documents and interviews with current and former employees and current and former members of the company s executive management and board of directors 
during the review period  the company granted options to purchase a total of  shares of its common stock adjusted for the two for one exchange on august  in connection with the company s reorganization  hereafter referred to as adjusted shares on different grant dates 
the company has specifically reviewed option grants on of the grant dates to determine what the proper measurement date should be for those grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
grants of options to purchase an aggregate of  adjusted shares were issued on these grant dates  constituting of all the options granted during the review period 
for the remaining grant dates not specifically reviewed  comprising options to purchase  adjusted shares  the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on the potential stock based compensation charge that might result from revised measurement dates 
the company did this by taking the average change in measurement date for the grant dates specifically reviewed and selecting the highest closing price of the company s stock within that period of time for each of the grant dates and determined the potential adjustment assuming all grant dates had a revised measurement date 
based on the sensitivity analysis  the company determined the potential adjustment would not be material to any given period or to the total stock based compensation expense recorded 

table of contents during the course of the investigation  the special committee also considered certain potential modifications of options granted during the review period  particularly those relating to changes in employment status for various recipients 
findings of the special committee on august   the special committee concluded its voluntary review of past stock option grant practices and determined that the original measurement dates of certain stock option grants  for financial accounting purposes  did not meet the requirements of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
consequently  we revised the measurement dates consistent with the standards of apb no 
based on the best information available  and when the closing price of our stock at the original stated grant date was lower than the closing price on the revised measurement date  additional compensation expense was calculated 
this resulted in additional stock based compensation expense in each fiscal year from through which aggregated million 
in addition  the revised measurement dates resulted in additional stock based compensation of million for the nine months ended september  for expense recognized under the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which the company adopted on january   because the exercise price for certain stock option grants prior to  but not vested as of january   differed from the fair market value on the revised measurement date  resulting in the calculation of increased fair values of said grants under the black scholes option pricing model 
the special committee also determined that with respect to a single grant  the special committee concluded that the balance of evidence indicated that it had been purposefully misdated 
adjustments to measurement dates the need to revise the measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants to meet the measurement date criteria of apb no 
is based on a number of different circumstances that can generally be summarized in the following categories lack of adequate documentation for a substantial number of grants issued by the company during the review period  there is either no or inadequate documentation of board approval actions that satisfy the requisites for establishing a measurement date under apb no 
of the specifically reviewed grant dates during the review period  there are documented approval actions by the board of directors with respect to particular grants for dates 
for grants to officers and directors which have no documented approval actions  the company was able to use form filing dates  if they exist  or proxy filings 
otherwise  the company used the best information available to select the measurement date for grants to officers  directors and rank and file employees which included contemporaneous lists that were substantially complete  signed stock option agreements if dated by the optionee or if the metadata of the document exists  e mail communication or other employee communication such as a memorandum 
if the stock options were granted prior to shareholder approval of the plan  the company used the date of shareholder approval as the selected measurement date since the stock options could not be granted prior to shareholder approval 
no contemporaneous documentation of approval for some grants which did have documented approval actions  there was no contemporaneous documentation to confirm that board approval had occurred on the indicated grant date 
grant approval in each of these cases was documented by unanimous written consent  using the as of date in the signed consent as the approval date 
the measurement dates were adjusted to conform to the date on which the last consent was received  as evidenced by the header on the sending telecopy  since the required granting actions  including approval  were not complete until the signed consents were returned to the company 
lack of finality of recipient list on company wide grants for other grants which had documented approval actions  the list of grant recipients and the number of options awarded to each recipient was not documented or determined with finality until a date subsequent to the original measurement date or in certain instances  the list was not available even though there was evidence of approval for a grant 
because the recipient list was not final until after the original grant date  the company determined the revised measurement 
table of contents date for the grant based on the best information available  which included using form filing dates  if they exist  otherwise  for grants to officers  directors and rank and file employees  the company used the metadata of the list that was complete or substantially complete  e mail communication or other employee communications such as a memorandum 
other stock option related items we also recorded stock based compensation expense in each fiscal year from through for other stock option related errors that were identified  which aggregated million 
these items include modification of option terms the company modified stock option terms in connection with separation agreements for three individuals and did not previously record expense related to the modifications 
options for one director were accelerated in fiscal year april  resulting in expense of approximately  options for an officer were allowed to continue to vest and the term of exercisability was extended in fiscal year april   resulting in additional expense of approximately million 
lastly  options for an officer were modified during and further modified again in to accelerate the vesting and extend the term of exercisability  resulting in additional expense of million in and million in the company also modified stock option terms in connection with separation agreements for three individuals for which the company had originally recorded stock based compensation expense of million in due to the revision in measurement dates for some of these modified stock options  some stock based compensation expense was recorded prior to the modification which reduced the expense recorded at the time of modification by million 
the company also modified stock option terms in connection with employment agreements for two officers in january the modification was to add a term to the employment agreement whereby upon termination  if the employee exercises in the money options within the term of the option agreement  the company will reimburse the amount of the strike price of those options to the employee 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  fin  this is treated as a fixed cash bonus award accounted for as stock based compensation 
this resulted in additional expense until the employment agreements were terminated based on the vesting of the underlying options of million  million and million in  and the first nine months of  respectively 
non employee grants on two grant dates in and  the company granted options to employees of its owned subsidiary  brc 
these brc employees are considered non employees of the company and require fair value accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  since they are non employees  the value of their service would be used to value the options and would require the re measurement principles under eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  to determine the fair value each reporting period 
this resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of million from through march   the date of the acquisition of the second of brc  when the brc employees had a change in status from non employee to employee 
under fin  upon a change in status  there is a new measurement date for the options and  on a go forward basis  they are accounted under the new method based on the grantee status  in this case  employee under apb no 
option repricing with respect to two grant dates  there is documentation of board approval actions which contain a list of grantees  the number of options granted and the option price is known 
the documentation satisfies the requisites for establishing a measurement date under apb no 
based on other grant documentation available  it appears the options were repriced subsequent to the board approval at a later date when the fair market value of the stock was at a lower price 
as a result  under fin  these grants are required to be accounted for under the variable accounting method which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  during fiscal years april  and options granted by a principal shareholder on june   questor partners fund lp and questor side by side partners lp collectively questor acquired  adjusted shares of the company s common stock and  shares of preferred stock convertible into  adjusted shares of common stock  giving questor the ability with the conversion to hold  adjusted shares of common stock 
in connection with the stock purchase  questor granted  options to purchase the company s common stock at an exercise price of to certain officers of the company 
the options vested twenty five percent on june  and thereafter on each of the next three anniversaries of such date 
the options were exercisable only after the 
table of contents preferred stock purchased by questor is converted or is convertible into the company s common stock and also will become exercisable upon the earlier of i five years after the date of the purchase agreement and ii the sale by questor of or more shares of common stock owned by them on the date of the purchase 
subsequent to questor s acquisition of common stock  they held approximately of the total outstanding common shares and of the total outstanding preferred shares 
in addition  questor was represented on the board of directors with two of the six board seats 
since questor was a principal stockholder when they granted the options to purchase common stock to the company s officers  in accordance with aicpa accounting interpretation no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  interpretation of apb no 
 as part of the restatement  the company recorded compensation expense of million over the vesting period from june  through january  see discussion below related to the grant of these shares under apb no 
since they were issued with an exercise price below fair market value on the date of grant 
on january   questor notified the officers that questor had sold or more of the shares of common stock it owned as of june   and per the agreement  the unvested options became fully vested and all vested options needed to be exercised in days 
accordingly  the unamortized stock based compensation was recorded to expense in january since all of the remaining options became fully vested 
in march each of the officers exercised the questor options as described below 
non recourse loans for exercise of options on march  each of the company s officers exercised their questor options to purchase impco common stock at per share 
the company extended loans to the officers for the full purchase price of an aggregate of million 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for stock compensation arrangements with employer loan features under apb no 
 these loans are considered non recourse notes 
the officers had days from january  to exercise these options 
since the loans to officers extended the original term of the option  the options are considered new awards with a new measurement date as of march  in addition  because the note is prepayable  the options are considered variable awards until the note is fully paid off 
as part of the restatement  the company recorded million of expense related to these option grants from march until the loan payoff in july tax impact as a result of the change in measurement dates described above  certain stock options granted during the review period were issued at prices below fair market value on the revised measurement date and should have been classified as non qualified stock options nqs  rather than incentive stock options isos 
due to the differences in the tax treatment between isos and nqs  the company under reported or under withheld certain payroll taxes for those nq options 
as part of the restatement of the company s financial statements in this form k  the company has accrued liabilities and recorded charges to operating expenses for payroll tax contingencies and related penalties and interest 
the tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  that we have recorded include the impact of the reclassification of these options for tax purposes as depicted in the pre tax payroll tax adjustments column of the table included in accounting impact below 
upon expiration of the related statute of limitations for payroll taxes  which we have determined to be three years  the company recorded the reversal of the payroll tax liability and related penalties and interest 
while the company has informed the internal revenue service irs regarding the payroll taxes liabilities resulting from changes in measurement dates for stock options  no formal settlement negotiations have taken place with the irs 
the actual payroll tax liability could be different from the tax liability accrued 
the most significant assumption is the statute of limitations which the company has determined to be three years 
while the company believes that they have a reasonable basis to conclude that the statute of limitations is three years  there are no assurances that it will prevail in this matter 
the company has an accrual of approximately million for payroll related taxes as of december  the total reversals of accrued payroll tax liability and related penalties and interest through december  were approximately million using the three year statute of limitations 
the company recorded deferred tax assets as a result of the stock based compensation expense recorded through the restatement based on unexercised and uncancelled stock options at the end of each reporting period 
section a of the internal revenue code  as amended  imposes additional taxes on our employees for stock options granted with an exercise price lower than the fair market value on the date of grant for all options or portions of options that vest after december  as a result of the change in measurement dates described above  certain stock options granted during the review period were issued at prices below fair market value on the revised measurement date 
management is considering possible ways to address the impact that section a may have as a result of the exercise price of stock options being less than the fair market value of our common stock on the revised measurement dates 
the internal revenue service has issued transition rules under section a that allow for a correction or cure for some of these options subject to section a 
the company may offer non officer employees who hold outstanding options the opportunity to cure their affected stock options 
in connection with this cure  the company may make cash bonus payments to our non officer employees in an undetermined amount 
the internal revenue code section m limitations did not apply since no covered employee received compensation in excess of million 

table of contents accounting impact the table below reflects the impact of the additional non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax liability and income tax impact on the company s consolidated statements of income from through the third quarter of  including the corresponding cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit as of april  on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
prior to this restatement  the company had not recorded any non cash stock based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of income with the exception of million recorded during for a modification of previous stock option awards for its former chief executive officer  its former vice president and chief operating officer for international operations and its former chief financial officer of the company

b the company previously recorded the tax benefit for tax deductions related to stock based compensation as an increase to additional paid in capital in accordance with apb no 
to the extent this tax benefit relates to stock based compensation recorded as part of our restatement of our financial statements  the tax benefit previously recorded to additional paid in capital was recorded as a decrease to income tax expense 

table of contents procedural and remedial actions as of the time of filing this annual report on form k  our management has completed the implementation of its remediation efforts related to the consolidated financial statement material weakness over stock based compensation  including stock options  which include the following specified members of the accounting and finance management team have  through the process of restating our financial statements for the results of our voluntary stock option review  received specialized hands on training on us gaap and tax stock based compensation issues  pronouncements  policies and procedures  we have suspended the granting of stock options since november  and do not intend to grant any stock options  and we have formalized internal control improvements by documenting the accounting and operational policies and procedures over the granting  modification  cancellation and overall monitoring of stock based compensation 
the audit committee and board of directors are also committed to the implementation of procedural enhancements in light of the special committee s findings 
these procedural enhancements include the following seeking remittance of proceeds resulting from misdating from certain former executives  requiring corporate governance training for board members  requiring specialized training for the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  and formalizing job descriptions and scope of responsibilities for senior management 
we will begin seeking remittance of proceeds and complete the remaining procedural enhancements by the end of costs of the review and restatement the company has incurred substantial expenses related to the special committee s review and the company s analysis of these stock option grants 
we have incurred approximately million in costs for legal fees  external audit firm fees and external consulting fees through september  regulatory matters the company reported the special committee s findings to the securities and exchange commission and continues to cooperate with the securities and exchange commission regarding matters relating to the special committee s review of historical stock option grant practices 
the company has received letters from the staff of the nasdaq stock market stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of this form k  our march  form q and our june  form q  we are subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market 
to date  nasdaq has granted an exception to the listing requirement  pending further review  and subject to filing its delinquent reports by specified dates 
with the filing of this report and the filing of the company s quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march  and june   the company believes that it has remedied the non compliance with marketplace rule c 
however  there can be no assurance that the listing council will decide to allow the company s common stock to remain listed on nasdaq stock market 

table of contents restatement related to eliminations for intercompany inventory in addition to the adjustments related to the stock option review  the restated consolidated financial statements presented in this form k include an adjustment to correct an accounting error for the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in and as of and for the years ended december   and this correction relates to an error made in calculating the gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory remaining on the books of certain of our subsidiaries at period end 
the impact of the correction  net of taxes  decreased our net income by million for the quarter ended march   increased our net income by million for the quarter ended june   decreased our net income by million for the quarter ended september   decreased our net loss by million for the year ended december   increased our net loss by million for the year ended december   and increased our net loss by million for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the impact on the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in restatement related to income taxes we are also reflecting adjustments  as part of our restatement  to correct accounting errors in recording income tax expense for the first three quarters in and each of the quarters in and as of and for the year ended december  previously  we had taken the position that the foreign earnings for brc srl brc  our italian subsidiary  were permanently reinvested and therefore no residual us income tax was recorded under apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
however  for us income tax purposes  the loan from mtm srl mtm  a subsidiary of brc  to impco technologies  inc impco  our us subsidiary  entered into in december  is deemed to be a constructive dividend and therefore created taxable income that we did not previously recognize in our provision for income taxes 
for the impco loan interest payments to mtm  we are required to withhold us tax on the payments  which we did not previously withhold 
as a result  we have recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million for the nine months ended september  and million for the year ended december  we also recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  to correct for an error in recording deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our brc operations in december  we have reflected the impact of the adjustments related to our voluntary stock option review and gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory on our income tax disclosure in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements but have also corrected this income tax disclosure for errors in our disclosure of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance by reducing both balances due to utilization of net operating loss carryovers because the loan from mtm is treated as a constructive dividend for u 
s income tax purposes  as discussed above  and due to ownership changes which took place since leading us to conclude that certain of our federal net operating loss carryovers  federal tax credit carryovers  state net operating loss carryovers and state tax credit carryovers will expire unused due to limitations imposed under internal revenue code section and in the aggregate  the reduction we recorded resulted in a reduction to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction to the related valuation reserve in the amount of million 
correction of account classification our restatement also reflects adjustments to correct for errors in account classification between selling  general and administrative expense  cost of revenue and other income expense  net 
these adjustments primarily relate to the reclassification of other manufacturing costs of foreign subsidiaries which were included in selling  general and administrative expenses instead of cost of revenue  and costs related to the closure of our cerritos facility which were classified as cost of revenue instead of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also corrected errors in classification on the balance sheet primarily between short term and long term for deferred tax balances and compensation related accrued expenses and between raw materials and finished goods 

table of contents summary the table below reflects the impact of the accounting errors that have been corrected  including the additional non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax liability and income tax impact recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing  may   through the quarter ended september   the adjustment to the gross profit elimination for intercompany inventory recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing from january  through the quarter ended september   and the adjustment to income tax expense recorded in each fiscal year for the period commencing from january  through the quarter ended september  the adjustment to correctly classify costs between selling  general and administrative expense and cost of sales have not been reflected in the table below as they represent reclassification of costs that do not have an impact on our net income  earnings per share or equity

nasdaq began listing fuel systems common stock on the nasdaq global market under a new trading symbol  fsys on august  we believe that the reorganization  through the formation of the holding company  fuel systems  with impco and brc being separate  stand alone operating entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of fuel systems  offers several advantages it promotes greater management accountability at the corporate and individual operating unit levels  it creates greater flexibility to respond to customer needs  and it aligns each operating subsidiary with specific core product lines and business segments 
as part of the reorganization  stockholders of impco received one whole share of common stock of fuel systems in exchange for every two shares of impco common stock owned at the time of the reorganization 
stockholders received cash for any fractional shares held equal to a proportionate interest in the gross proceeds of the sale on nasdaq of the aggregate fractional shares 
all outstanding warrants to purchase impco common stock became warrants to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such warrant terms  with any fractional shares treated in accordance with the warrant terms 
all outstanding options to purchase impco common stock became options to purchase one whole share of fuel systems common stock for every two shares of impco common stock subject to such option  with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole number 
the exercise price of the warrants and options following the reorganization became equal to twice the exercise price of such option or warrant immediately prior to the reorganization 
the post reorganization consolidated financial statements of fuel systems presented herein are presented on the same basis as and can be compared to the consolidated financial statements reported in impco s prior quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec 
all share numbers and per share amounts are stated for fuel systems and have given effect to the two for one exchange of impco stock into fuel systems stock that was effected pursuant to the reorganization 
the reorganization transaction is described in detail in the proxy statement prospectus on form s  filed by fuel systems with the sec on july  and declared effective that day 
that filing also includes the full text of the certificate of incorporation of fuel systems 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems to the transportation  industrial and power generation industries on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas  for use in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for more than years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of hundreds of distributors and dealers in countries and original equipment manufacturers 

table of contents prior to august   we have previously presented our operations in three business segments us operations  international operations and brc operations 
on august   the stockholders of impco adopted the agreement and plan of reorganization pursuant to which impco and brc immediately became separate  stand alone operating entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of fuel systems solutions  inc see reorganization above 
therefore  our management believes that presentation of operating results in two business segments  impco operations and brc operations  is more appropriate 
under our new system of reporting operations  impco operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the industrial market through its us and foreign facilities in the netherlands  australia and japan and distribution channels  including complete certified engines  fuel systems  parts and conversion systems  for applications in the transportation  material handling  stationary and portable power generator markets 
this new operating segment is a combination of our previously reported us operations and international operations segments 
brc operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the transportation market through its italy and foreign facilities in argentina and brazil 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the corporate level  which became the fuel systems level after the reorganization 
intercompany sales between and within impco operations and brc operations have been eliminated in the results reported 
we acquired brc on march  and included the results of brc s operations with our consolidated results beginning with the second quarter of and with our balance sheet as of march  as of december   we no longer consolidated our operations in mexico and india as part of our international operations segment 
instead  during we accounted for these operations using the equity method of accounting since we had ownership in these entities and lack effective control over their operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to liquidate our mexico operations and began the process of liquidation in the first quarter of we closed our mexico operations in june we also converted our joint venture in india into independent distributorships in order to reduce the administrative costs of maintaining the joint venture while continuing to sell our products in these markets 
we sold our share in our joint venture in india to the other owner in april net income was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net loss of million on revenue of approximately million in operating income increased by approximately million to million  compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in inventory reserve resulting from a specific review of inventory with approximately million attributed to brc 
brc also recorded a million unrealized loss in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during we cannot predict nor assure readers that the operating performance of impco or brc will continue into or be as favorable for future reporting periods or fiscal years 
we cannot predict nor assure readers that movements in foreign exchange will be either unfavorable as in or favorable as in for future reporting periods or fiscal years 
net loss was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net loss of million on revenue of approximately million in the net loss for includes an increase in income tax expense of million and million of additional compensation expenses in connection with the extension of the terms of options issued to our former chief executive officer and former chief operating officer for impco 
we also recorded additional provision for slow moving inventory and uncollectible accounts totaling million in our mexico operation reflecting the declining level of business in that market 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for our equity investment in our owned affiliate in mexico  ibmexicano 
we did not believe that there would be adequate cash flows generated from ibmexicano to support its carrying value in our consolidated financial statements 
anticipating the closure and liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary in mexico in the first half of  we wrote off the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of million which had been previously deferred during the course of consolidating our wholly owned mexico subsidiary 
these losses in were partially offset by a strong operating performance by our brc operations in which revenue on a twelve month basis were million or higher than revenue and net income was million or higher over the same period 
our share in these earnings was million and million during and  respectively  or an increase of million 
brc also recorded a million transaction gain in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during 
table of contents net loss for the year ended december  of million included a loss on the extinguishment of debt of million on the payoff of the bison loan in december  an increase in income tax expense of million  a write off of goodwill totaling million for reduction of business in japan and mexico  a change in accounting estimate for excess and obsolete inventories resulting in a charge of million  additional costs incurred for preparation and auditing for sarbanes oxley act of of approximately million  and severance costs of personnel reductions of approximately million in conjunction with the board approved transition plan for the integration of impco and brc 
recent developments incentive bonus plan in august  our stockholders approved the incentive bonus plan 
under the plan  the compensation committee of our board of directors may grant bonus awards in the form of cash  restricted stock or a combination of both to some or all of impco s and brc s employees based on the divisions profitability and the attainment of individual employee s performance goals 
based on profitability of both impco and brc for  some employees were paid bonuses in may a portion of the bonus was paid in cash and a portion in restricted stock totaling  shares of restricted stock 
the restricted stock vests on the date of the grant and the balance in three equal annual installments 
accordingly  we have recorded an expense of million compensation expense during  of which million relates to the portion of the restricted stock that was fully vested at the date of grant 
relocation of north american headquarters on september   we signed an agreement to sublease a  square foot building  including  square feet of office space  located in santa ana  california  for a term of years beginning september  we relocated our combined corporate headquarters and impco us business operations from our former location in cerritos  california  to the santa ana facility in april we believe the new location has sufficient space to modernize and consolidate most of our north american production and component engineering facilities 
we have installed new state of the art production lines  machining  and test equipment in the santa ana facility 
as a global leader in the alternative fuels marketplace  our strategy is to use the improved efficiencies  capabilities and capacity to position us to better serve our markets and to take advantage of new products and new markets 
the annual rent for the santa ana facility is million  which is set to increase every year pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
the terms of the sublease agreement also include rent abatement for the first three months  subject to certain conditions 
in connection with this relocation  we recognized approximately million in expenses during  consisting of approximately million for accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  approximately million for the recognition of incremental rent expense for the santa ana facility prior to the exit of the cerritos facility in early  million for relocation and set up costs and approximately million for the fair value of the remaining lease obligation of the cerritos facility which extends until during  we incurred million for incremental rent expense for the santa ana facility prior to the exit of the cerritos facility in april and revised the estimated cost for the sublease of the cerritos facility and recorded an additional expense of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in cash outflows including approximately million in leasehold improvements in the new facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally when products are shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and management believes collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable unless they are secured under an irrevocable letter of credit arrangement guaranteed by a reputable financial institution  and accordingly  we defer such revenue until amounts become due and payable 
the costs of shipping and handling  when incurred  are recognized in the cost of goods sold 
we provide for returns and allowances as circumstances and facts require 
sales to our unconsolidated subsidiaries are made on terms similar to those prevailing with unrelated customers as noted above 
we defer a pro rata portion of the gross profit on sales for the inventory of the unconsolidated subsidiaries until the inventory is sold to a third party customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 
inventory reserves 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers each subsidiary to be a reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we operate wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
we record goodwill at the time of purchase for the amount of the purchase price over the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an 
table of contents inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
during  we recorded a million impairment loss of goodwill for our operations in mexico and japan 
the annual reviews performed in the fourth quarters of and resulted in no impairment to goodwill 
intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets acquired if they are determined to have definite useful lives 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology and trade names  are amortized on a straight line basis  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefits  over their estimated reasonable useful lives 
certain other intangible assets such as customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method since the value of customer relationships is expected to decline at a faster rate 
deferred taxes 
based upon the substantial net operating loss carryovers and expected future operating results  we conclude that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets in the united states at december  may not be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total valuation allowance was million as of december  in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to our interest in impco beru technologies bv  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
residual us taxes have been accrued applied as a reduction to net operating loss carry forwards on approximately million of earnings of brc for the mtm loan and million of earnings of impco technologies fuel systems  pty 
limited  the australian subsidiary of impco for an intercompany transaction as such amounts were deemed to be a constructive dividend creating taxable income for us income tax purposes  upon distribution of earnings in the form of dividends  or otherwise  in excess of these amounts  we may be subject to united states income taxes 
in addition  the company would be subject to withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
to the extent we have repaid the mtm loan we have repaid million as of october   which is net of our recent million in short term borrowings from mtm  such amounts could be drawn as a dividend from brc without us income tax consequences 
foreign currency agreements 
we recognize changes in the fair value of a foreign currency agreement as a component of other income and expense on the consolidated statement of operations  unless the agreement qualifies under hedge accounting 
if hedge accounting applies  changes in the fair value of the hedging agreement would be deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as other income and expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  expected stock price volatility  and expected pre vesting option forfeitures 
we base these estimates on historical experience 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our revenue and operating income in thousands revenue years ended december  impco operations brc operations total operating income years ended december  as restated impco operations brc operations corporate expenses total impco operations is a combination of our previously reported us operations and international operations segments

the industrial market increased by million  or 

table of contents for the year ended december   operating income increased million  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is partially attributed to the inclusion of brc s results for the entire year in  while for  was only consolidated in the period from april through december after the acquisition of the second of brc on march  to a lesser extent  the absence of operating losses from our mexico operations in also contributed to the favorable comparison to in addition  cost cutting measures implemented in  which included the relocation of our research and development facility in seattle  washington to impco s operations in california  resulted in improvements in operating income 
further contributing to the improvement between the two periods was the absence in of approximately million in compensation and severance related costs for two former executive officers recorded in  partially offset by approximately million in inventory reserve resulting from a specific review of inventory with approximately million attributed to brc  the increase of approximately million in stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas r in  and an accrual of million for the incentive bonus plan  which was approved by stockholders on august  impco operations 
data for has been reclassified to reflect our new presentation of operating segments impco operations is a combination of our previously reported us operations and international operations segments 
during  revenue increased by approximately million  or  to million  from million during the increase in revenue during was primarily due to a million increase in revenue from the transportation market related to increased in demand in the second half of the year related to energy initiatives effective in australia for liquified petroleum gas or lpg vehicles and a million increase in revenue from the industrial market 
operating income for increased by approximately million  from million in the same period in the improvement was mainly due to benefits realized from cost reductions implemented in  which included the relocation of our research and development facility in seattle  washington to impco s us operations in california 
in addition  the absence of expenses related to our mexico operations  which were closed at the end of also contributed to the improvement in operating income  as well as the absence of a charge for a change in estimate of the write off related to the planned liquidation of our mexico operations 
these amounts were partially offset by a million accrual for the incentive bonus plan which was approved by stockholders on august  brc operations 
brc operations became a business segment in the second quarter of in  its revenue was million  an increase of approximately million  or  as compared to the increase in revenue in is partially attributed to the inclusion of brc revenue for the entire twelve month period in  whereas in  brc was initially reported as a equity method investment until april   at which time it was consolidated 
in addition  brc has also experienced growth in the transportation market attributed in part to increases experienced by consumers in gasoline prices  which has oriented automotive manufacturers to promote gaseous fuel equipment 
brc s operating income for was million  million higher than in brc operations became an operating segment of our business in the second quarter of  so the earlier period in the comparison included only nine months 
the increase was mainly due the increase in revenue partially offset by the inclusion of an expense for an increase in inventory reserve of million resulting from a specific review of inventory  by a million accrual for the incentive bonus plan which was approved by stockholders on august  and amortization and depreciation expense resulting from purchase price allocation 
approximately million and million in amortization and depreciation expenses related to intangible assets and step up in fair value of fixed assets acquired in the acquisition of the remaining of brc were also included in the brc operations for the years and  respectively 
we completed the purchase price allocation of the brc acquisition in the fourth quarter of and allocated approximately million and million to intangible assets and fixed assets  respectively  with estimated useful lives ranging from seven to eleven years for the intangible assets and five to eight years for the fixed assets 
for and  respectively  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million and million for the intangible assets  and approximately million and million for depreciation of the step up in fair value of fixed assets 
in future years  the amount of amortization and depreciation will vary due to future changes to the remaining useful lives  movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  and the use of an accelerated amortization schedule for the fair value allocated to customer relationships  however  we estimate that the amount of combined amortization and depreciation during will be approximately million 

table of contents corporate expenses 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the corporate level to support our business segments in areas such as executive management  finance  human resources  management information systems  legal and accounting services  and investor relations 
corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million in the prior year 
corporate expenses in included recognition of expense of approximately million in compensation expense related to million stock options granted in prior fiscal years to a former officer and million in severance related costs paid to former officers in as well as stock based compensation expense related to vesting of stock options of million 
stock based compensation expense was approximately million in resulting from the adoption of sfas r on january  corporate expenses in increased due to million in increased costs associated with our reorganization and million in increased costs related to our sarbanes oxley act section compliance efforts to include brc in since brc was not required to be included in our compliance efforts in interest income 
interest income was approximately million in and approximately million in the increase is due to higher yields on marketable securities in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in interest expense was due to the higher variable interest rate on our revolving credit facility for impco us operations with la salle business credit  llc 
in addition  the increase was also due to increased usage on our brc revolving credit facilities used to fund working capital due to growth in the business during as compared to other income and expense 
other income and expense is primarily composed of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses between the us dollar and the euro with respect to marking to market of the mtm loan balance  and the gains and losses with respect to the fair value determination of the related foreign exchange hedging agreement since the agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan between the us dollar and the euro  offset by a gain on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized gains on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan between the us dollar and the euro consisting of approximately million recorded in other income and approximately million recorded in equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries offset by a recognized loss on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million 
we routinely conduct transactions in currencies other than our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we cannot estimate or forecast the direction or the magnitude of any foreign exchange movements with any currency that we transact in  therefore  we do not measure or predict the future impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 
income of equity share in unconsolidated affiliates 
during the year ended december   we recognized our share in the income of brc s unconsolidated affiliates in the amount of million 
since our acquisition of the initial of brc in july  we began accounting for brc s operating results using the equity method whereby we recognized of the earnings of brc in our financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we continued this accounting treatment until we completed the acquisition of the remaining of brc on march  for periods following march   we fully consolidated the results of brc and eliminated all intercompany transactions 
during the first quarter of  we recognized income of approximately million  net of an elimination of an intercompany gain of million  based on million of income reported by brc

in  income tax expense for our foreign operations was approximately million based on an estimated effective annual tax rate of 
for  income tax expense for our foreign operations  excluding mexico operations  was approximately million based on an 
table of contents effective annual tax rate of 
the increase in tax expense from prior year is predominantly attributed to the increase in pretax earnings in and the increase in effective annual tax rate is due to increase in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to brazil and argentina 
impco us operations recorded a tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  of which million is related to foreign tax withheld on dividends received from our netherlands subsidiary  an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to the amortization of goodwill for income tax purposes  that is not offset against the deferred tax asset in the determination of the required valuation allowance  as well as state taxes due 
the remaining million relates to us tax withholding obligations on impco interest payments to mtm under the mtm loan 
we expect to reduce the valuation allowance if we are profitable or provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states if we have additional losses until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets each quarter 
in  impco us operations recorded an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes of approximately million to reserve the carrying value of net deferred tax assets because we determined that the likelihood of recoverability of the net deferred tax asset was less than the more likely than not threshold as defined by sfas no

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
our ongoing operations are funded by cash generated from operations and debt financings 
in addition  these sources of cash provide for capital expenditures  research and development  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations and prospective new lines of business 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  credit agreements currently  we are party to four significant credit agreements lasalle senior credit facility 
our first significant credit agreement is an asset based credit facility with lasalle business credit  llc or lasalle dated july   as amended 
the lasalle senior credit facility matures on january  this revolving credit facility carried an interest rate per annum equal to prime plus  which amounted to per annum at december  and at december   and has a borrowing limit equal to of our eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of million or of our eligible inventory as measured from time to time  subject to reasonable reserves established by lasalle in its discretion 
in july  the interest rate was adjusted to equal prime plus 
this lender has a senior security interest in substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
as of december  this facility carried a maximum borrowing limit of million  of which million was the actual borrowing capacity 
as of september   this facility carried a maximum borrowing limit of million  of which million was the actual borrowing capacity 
on october   the maximum borrowing limit was reduced to million 
at december  our outstanding balance under this loan agreement was million and approximately million was available for borrowing as of that date 
the current financial covenants include  among other things  limits on capital expenditures within any four successive quarters to million for impco us and million for impco world wide operations  and a requirement that we maintain a year to date impco us minimum pre tax income of not less than a million loss at any month end beginning may  at december   we were not in compliance with the impco us pre tax income covenant and lasalle waived our non compliance 
on july  we announced that our financial statements on or after january   should no longer be relied on 
as a result we were not compliant with our obligations to provide the lender with current and accurate financial statements 
lasalle has waived our non compliance resulting from the restatement of our historical financial statements on the condition that we provide them with the restated historical and current financial statements in this annual report on form k and our quarterly reports on form q by october  in addition  lasalle waived the financial covenants for each of the fiscal quarters ending june  through and including september  because they may have been impacted as a result of the restatement 
we also had to seek waivers from lasalle pertaining to our non compliance with the minimum us pre tax income covenant for the year to date periods ending july   august  and september  and the us tangible net worth covenant as of september   which we received 
we have no assurances that lasalle will be willing to continue to grant us waivers of and amendments to the terms of this senior credit facility 
in addition  amendments or waivers may be on terms that are different from and more onerous to us than the current terms of the senior credit facility 
for example  in connection with granting us recent waivers  lasalle has required that we make no payments to mtm under the loan between fuel systems and mtm 
in order to avoid defaulting on the mtm loan  we have had to borrow additional principal amounts from mtm and use the additional indebtedness to make the required debt service payments back to mtm 
the credit facility expires on january  lasalle has indicated its intent to not renew our credit facility in the long term and they may or may not be willing to extend beyond that date while we transition to a new lender 
if we do not receive additional waivers and amendments if needed  or if we seek and do not receive an extension we would have to draw dividends or receive loans from our subsidiaries to repay the amounts owing or refinance the debt 
our ability to find replacement financing is hampered by the long delay in filing this annual report on form k for and the quarterly reports on form q for the first two quarters of and our need to present the consolidated financial statements contained in these periodic reports to prospective lenders as part of the loan application process 
as a result  we may not be able to secure a new credit facility on terms that are favorable to us before the expiration of the lasalle senior credit facility and we may not be able to secure a new credit facility by that time  if at all 
if we cannot repay the amounts owning under the lasalle senior credit facility  our lenders may foreclose on certain of our assets or take other legal action against us that  alone or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents mtm loan 
our second significant credit agreement is the mtm loan pursuant to which impco borrowed approximately million from mtm on december  the proceeds of the mtm loan were used to retire approximately million of our indebtedness to bison capital structured equity partners llc  an amount that included a prepayment premium and accrued but unpaid interest 
the mtm loan carries a rate equal to above three month euribor per annum  which was at at december  and at december   provided that the rate will increase to above three month euribor after and during the continuance of a default under the mtm loan agreement and to above three month euribor on any unpaid portion of the loan outstanding days after the maturity date of december  beginning on april   the loan is being repaid in quarterly installments  each in the amount of not less than million in the first two years  million in the third year  million in the fourth year and million in the final year  with any remaining unpaid principal and interest to be repaid upon maturity 
the mtm loan and related interest have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the mtm loan provides for automatic acceleration of the amounts borrowed in case of a default due to nonpayment for more than days after the date due or due to the termination of mariano costamagna as our chief executive officer or a material breach of his employment agreement 
the mtm loan also provides for acceleration of the loan upon notice from mtm in case of any other default under the loan 
in addition  the mtm loan contains restrictive covenants limiting our ability to terminate mariano costamagna as our chief executive officer  with certain exceptions for termination upon mr 
costamagna s death  incur additional debt obligations other than unsecured trade credit  capital leases and additional debt obligations pursuant to the lasalle senior credit facility  merge  consolidate or sell our assets  purchase  retire or redeem our capital stock  and make capital expenditures in excess of million in fiscal and million in subsequent fiscal years 
at december   the amount owed under the mtm loan was approximately million and we were in compliance with the covenants in the mtm loan and other related terms and conditions 
mariano costamagna and pier antonio costamagna have guaranteed the mtm loan 
in return for their guarantees  we have pledged our equity interest in brc as collateral in the event the guarantee is utilized 
if we fail to perform the terms of the mtm loan and messrs 
costamagna are required to fulfill their guarantees  they may require us to reimburse them for their payments as guarantors  or they may take possession of our equity interest in brc  or both 
if they were to take possession of the brc equity interest in total or partial satisfaction of their rights under the pledge agreement  we would lose our rights to participate in brc s earnings and assets 
this would have a material adverse effect upon our earnings and our financial position 
in connection with our continuing non compliance under the lasalle senior credit agreement  lasalle has required that we make no payments to mtm under the mtm loan since july  in order to avoid defaulting on the mtm loan  we have had to borrow additional principal amounts from mtm and use the additional indebtedness to make the required debt service payments 
as of october   we owed mtm an additional million in short term debt that we must repay by december  an event of default under the lasalle senior credit facility would not automatically cause a cross default under the mtm loan 
on december   mtm entered into a five year unsecured term loan agreement with unicredit banca medio credito spa of italy  our third significant credit agreement  in which mtm received approximately million based on the december  exchange rate of to the euro 
the proceeds of the loan were used for working capital purposes and contributed towards the million lent to impco on december  the payment terms are such that mtm will pay million on a quarterly basis throughout the term of the loan and interest based on the month euribor rate plus per annum  which was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   the amount outstanding was approximately million 
the loan agreement requires that mtm maintain a debt to equity ratio of less than 
in addition  mtm is required to maintain net assets of at least million based on the exchange rate of on december  at december   mtm was in compliance with these covenants 
brc borrowings 
on june   brc entered into a five and a half year unsecured term loan agreement with intesa sanpaolo spa of italy  our fourth significant credit agreement  in which brc received approximately million based on the exchange rate at june  the proceeds for the loan were used to purchase zavoli  srl which was completed on july  for approximately million 
the payment terms are such that brc will pay equal installments on a semi annual basis throughout the term of the loan and 
table of contents interest based on six month euribor rate plus 
per annum  which was at june  at june   the amount outstanding was million 
the loan agreement requires that brc maintain a ratio of indebtedness to ebita of less than to maintain this rate 
in the event the ratio of indebtedness to ebita exceeds the effective rate may adjust upward not to exceed six month euribor rate plus 
other loans brc is also party to two additional credit agreements in and  brc entered into unsecured term loan agreements with the italian ministry of industry for the purpose of funding the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and research and development expenditures 
the loan was paid off in january the loan is repayable in semi annual installments through at a subsidized rate of 
at december   approximately million was owed under the loan 
at december   brc had an unsecured line of credit amounting to approximately million  based on the exchange rate at december   with no outstanding balance 
additionally  brc has up to a million line of commercial credit secured by customer account receivable  based on the exchange rate at december   of which million was outstanding at december  and million was available for borrowing 
interest rates at december  for the unsecured credit facility and the commercial credit facility were three month euribor plus and  respectively  which were and  respectively 
both lines of credit are callable on demand 
other borrowings 
in addition  our subsidiary in the netherlands has a million credit facility based on the exchange rate at december  with fortis bank 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
liquidity ratios our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  at december   our total working capital had increased by million to million from million at december  this increase is due primarily to the increase in inventory during both in impco operations and brc operations  which increased by million and million  respectively 
a further factor was the million decrease in accounts payable  comparing december  with december   as a result of a decrease in brc operations accounts payable of million and an increase in impco operations accounts payable of million 

table of contents cash flows our restatement of our financial statements did not result in a change to our previously reported cash flow from operations or total cash and cash equivalents shown in our historical consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in operating activities in  was million compared to million in net cash provided by operations for cash flows used in operating activities in  consisted of net of income of million adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses of million which included million in amortization of intangible assets acquired and million in depreciation of the step up in fair value of brc s assets compared to million of net loss adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses in other non cash charges that impacted net income in related to provision for inventory reserve of million and the minority interest in income of consolidated affiliates of million and million in unrealized loss from the net effect of movements between the us dollar and the euro on the mtm loan balance and the fair value adjustment for the foreign currency derivative instrument 
these were partially offset by million in our share in the income of unconsolidated affiliates 
in  other non cash charges that impacted net loss included write off of deferred tax asset and valuation allowance against deferred taxes of million  a million in expense related to modification of stock options held by former executive officers and stock based compensation and an impairment loss in investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries of million 
changes in working capital that affected operating cash flows were a million increase in inventory due the brc acquisition  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in accounts receivable  offset by a million decrease in related party balances 
as compared to the same period in  changes in working capital that affected operating cash flows included million increase in accounts payable  and a million increase in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities in  was million  million less compared to the million used in the lower amount used in resulted from several partly offsetting factors 
the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements in was million greater than in  due to the relocation of the impco operations north american headquarters  and due to purchases in brc operations 
while no cash was used in business acquisitions in  in million was used  primarily in payments made to brc stockholders totaling million as part of the acquisition of the remaining of brc completed on march  and approximately million in costs associated with the acquisition activities 
investing activities for included approximately million of cash on brc s balance sheet as acquired cash on march  net cash provided by financing activities in was million or a decrease of million from million provided by financing activities in this decrease was due primarily to the million net proceeds from the equity offerings in february in which million shares were sold to investors at a price of before underwriter fees and expenses of approximately million 
partly offsetting this decrease were proceeds from the exercise of stock options in of million  and the increased utilization of the revolving lines of credit of million 
our existing capital resources together with cash flows from operating activities may not be sufficient to fund our us operations  which bear the majority of our corporate expenses  for the next months 
corporate expenses for the nine months ended september   include million in costs in connection with our voluntary review of our historical stock option grants and the related restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements which must be funded by our us operations 
in order to obtain additional cash  we may draw a dividend from brc  which we have not done in the past  or obtain additional loans from brc 
we believe that we will not suffer significant negative tax implications from such a dividend because we have already recognized million related to the mtm loan as taxable income for us income tax purposes and have repaid million of the mtm loan which is net of our recent million in short term borrowings from mtm that could be drawn as a dividend without us income tax consequences 
we have historically depended on borrowings under our lasalle senior credit facility to fund our liquidity and capital needs 
in the last months we have had to seek multiple waivers and amendments from lasalle in order to prevent an event of default and acceleration of the indebtedness under the agreement 
we cannot assure investors that the lenders will continue to agree to amend the financial covenants any further or grant additional or continuing waivers in the future 
furthermore  the lasalle senior credit facility is currently scheduled 
table of contents to expire on january  lasalle has indicated its intent to not renew our credit facility in the long term and they may or may not be willing to extend beyond that date while we transition to a new lender  and we may not be able obtain a replacement credit facility from another lender 
if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing by the expiration of the lasalle senior credit agreement  we would have to draw dividends or obtain loans from our subsidiaries to repay the amounts owing 
our ability to find replacement financing is hampered by the long delay in filing this annual report on form k for and the quarterly reports on form q for the first two quarters of and our need to present the financial statements contained in these periodic reports to prospective lenders as part of the loan application process 
as a result  we may not be able to secure a new credit facility on terms that are favorable to us before the expiration of the lasalle senior credit facility and we may not be able to secure a new credit facility by that time  if at all 
if we cannot repay the amounts owning under the lasalle senior credit facility  or if we cannot obtain the necessary waivers or amendments  or return to compliance with lasalle covenants and all other loan covenants our lenders may foreclose on certain of our assets or take other legal action against us that  alone or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on us 
in connection with our continuing non compliance under the lasalle senior credit agreement  lasalle has required that we make no payments to mtm under the mtm loan since july  in order to avoid defaulting on the mtm loan  we have had to borrow additional principal amounts from mtm and use the additional indebtedness to make the required debt service payments 
for periods beyond months  we may seek additional financing to fund future operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities  or through agreements with corporate partners with respect to the development of our technologies and products 
however  we offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of fluctuations in our sales volumes or margins  because of costs related to the results of our review of our historical stock option grants or because of other factors identified in item a risk factors 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
on january   our then owned affiliate  brc initiated a foreign exchange forward contract for the purpose of hedging against foreign currency devaluations that might occur in the future between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the december  million loan made between impco and mtm  a subsidiary of brc 
this hedging agreement was not designed to hedge the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to foreign currency movements that occur from time to time that could impact the our consolidated financial results either favorably or unfavorably 
we concluded that this agreement did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  we recognized gains of approximately million and losses of approximately million for and  respectively  which are classified on the consolidated statements of operations as part of other income expense 
the company has recorded the fair value of this derivative  which amounted to approximately  at december  foreign currency management 
the results and financial condition of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the us dollar 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased as a result of the growth of our international subsidiaries 
the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency of the subsidiary 
an increase in the value of the us dollar increases the costs incurred by our subsidiaries  as most of our international subsidiaries inventory purchases are us dollar denominated  and thus the cost of our products  adversely affecting our competitiveness and profitability 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies and  when deemed appropriate  the use of forward currency contracts 

table of contents on december   impco concluded the million loan agreement with mtm in which mtm recorded a related party receivable on its books for million and impco recorded a corresponding related party liability on its books for the same amount 
under the agreement  the loan will be settled in us dollars 
mtm  an italian company  records transactions on its books using the euro as its reporting currency 
brc records the foreign exchange effect of carrying the mtm loan on its books  as well as other assets and liabilities to be settled in a currency other than the euro  even though this loan was being eliminated for financial reporting purposes beginning with the balance sheet at march  for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized loss on foreign exchange of approximately million on our statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized gain on foreign exchange of approximately million on our statement of operations of which million is reported as part of other income on our consolidated statements of operations and million in equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
we measured the impact on our statement of operations of a hypothetical increase and a decrease of the spot rate of the euro to the us dollar based on a starting point of dollars to the euro as of december  applied to the loan balance of million and determined that a strengthening of the euro to the dollar would result in a pre tax loss on foreign exchange on mtm s books of approximately million  and  conversely  if the euro weakened against the dollar  the impact would be an approximate gain on foreign exchange of million 
we seek to hedge our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our us dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
the term loans are denominated in local currencies and translated to us dollars at period end exchange rates 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement methodology to recognize and measure an income tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position is based on a two step approach 
the first step requires an entity to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not  be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
the second step requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in addition  previously recognized benefits from tax positions that no longer meet the new criteria would be derecognized 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin on january  upon adoption of fin  the company analyzed  to the extent deemed appropriate  filing positions for all open tax years in all us federal  foreign  and state jurisdictions where the company is required to file 
at the adoption date of january   the company had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin of approximately million  including interest and penalties 
additionally  approximately million was recorded as a reduction to deferred tax assets  which caused a corresponding reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
to the extent unrecognized tax benefits are recognized at a time such valuation allowance no longer exists  the total amount that would affect the effective tax rate is approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the sec requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange rates in their interim and annual filings 
the following discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including that it is based on a single point in time and that it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the change modeled 
although the results of this analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro 
on january   brc entered into foreign exchange forward contracts covering a three year period for the purpose of hedging the foreign exchange risk between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the quarterly payments made by impco to brc under the terms of the mtm loan 
this agreement was not designed to hedge the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to foreign currency movements that occur from time to time that could impact our consolidated financial results either favorably or unfavorably 
we concluded that this agreement did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  we recognized approximately million in losses and million 
table of contents in gains for and  respectively  which are classified on the consolidated statements of operations for each year as part of other income expense 
as of december  and december   the notional amounts of the foreign exchange forward contracts were million and million  respectively 
the fair values of these contracts as of december  and december   were approximately  and 
million  respectively 
we measured the sensitivity of the fair value of the foreign exchange agreements for two hypothetical cases a strengthening and a weakening of the spot rate of to the euro at december  the analysis showed that either a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of the foreign exchange agreements of approximately  compared to the actual recorded gain of million 
we also recognize foreign exchange gains and losses in relation to the mtm loan  which had carrying values of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
brc recognizes gains and losses on a mark to market basis of this loan balance on its books because the loan will be settled in us dollars and brc maintains its records in its reporting currency  the euro 
hypothetically  if the us dollar weakened from the spot rate of to the euro at december   to to the euro  brc would have recorded a loss on foreign exchange of approximately million for the year ended december   or an additional expense of million 
if the us dollar strengthened by to the euro from to at december   brc would have recorded a million loss on foreign exchange for the year ended december   or a reduction in the expense of million 
these losses would have offset the gains on the fair value adjustments of our foreign exchange forward contracts
