item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations for the periods discussed below should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as changes in the telecommunications market  the addition or expiration of customer contracts  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  lengthy sales cycles  the timing and expense of the expansion or contraction of our call center network  and other factors including those discussed under item a  risk factors 
overview we are a provider of enhanced directory assistance and other information services delivered through live operators and by electronic means 
we contract primarily with wireless carriers  voice over internet protocol voip providers  cable companies  competitive local exchange carriers clec  free directory assistance providers  prepaid carriers  and payphone operators to provide our services to their subscribers and users 
our proprietary enhanced directory assistance platform provides comprehensive directory assistance listings and other informational content and services 
other non directory assistance services and content include access to personal contacts and calendars  reservation services  movie listings and a variety of other unique services 
our special return to operator features  starback and autoback  make the telephone easier to use and are offered exclusively by metro one 
all of our services are provided by operators located only in the united states  or electronically 
many of our features or aspects thereof are the subject of patents or pending patent applications 
revenues are derived principally through fees charged to telecommunications carriers and other customers 
in addition to voice based services  we also provide enhanced directory assistance services in electronic format 
these services are provided to customers who electronically issue directory assistance queries and use the returned information to complete and correct their own data records 
we currently provide electronic directory assistance services in a number of delivery formats to meet customer needs including automated file processing and real time individual look ups 
we contract with a broad range of companies that require electronic directory assistance including companies in the service  marketing  and financial sectors 
our data services business represents an emerging business based on infrastructure originally developed to support our voice based call center business 
under a typical wholesale contract  a carrier agrees to route some or all of their directory assistance calls to us 
we offer our services to multiple carriers within the same market 
when a carrier s subscribers dial a typical directory assistance number  such as  or  the calls are routed to and answered by our operators identifying the service by that carrier s brand name 
each carrier customer establishes its own directory assistance fee structure for its subscribers 
wireless subscribers typically pay fees ranging from to plus airtime charges for our services 
we bear no subscriber collection risk with respect to carrier subscribers  however  there may be collection risk to the extent growth and profitability in the telecommunications industry decreases and to the extent we provide services to other types of customers 
we charge our carrier customers on a per call basis 
prices for services provided to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or customers who receive our services in electronic form  may vary based on the nature of the service  volume and other circumstances 
as discussed further under significant events below  as a result of the termination of contracts with significant customers  the company has experienced significant financial losses and reduction of cash flows over the last several years 
it is likely that additional losses will be incurred during parts or all of such customer losses have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and these events and issues raise doubt as to whether we can continue to operate as a going concern 
we have experienced net losses in each of the quarterly and annual periods since the first quarter of our management is aggressively pursuing new and additional sources of revenues and is working to grow our voice and data services businesses 
over the past two years we have significantly reduced the direct cost of delivering our services as well as significantly reduced our general and administrative overhead 
in addition  our management and board of directors are investigating and pursuing strategic alternatives for the company to improve operations  improve liquidity and capital resources  and provide stability to the company s financial position 
there can be no assurance that our plans will be successful 
our existing cash and cash equivalents will likely not be sufficient to fund our operations for the remainder of or beyond 
in order to continue as a going concern  we will need to significantly increase our revenues and or further reduce our costs and or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will be successful 
in such event  we may attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity  although we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to execute our operations according to our plans or obtain additional financing  we may be forced to cease operations 
significant events termination of contracts 
in february  we entered into a master services agreement for directory assistance services the services agreement with nextel operations  inc  acting on behalf of certain affiliates collectively nextel of nextel communications  inc the services agreement superseded our previous services agreement dated in june under the services agreement  we agreed to provide directory assistance services to nextel s customers on a non exclusive basis  and nextel could transition call volume away from us on short notice and or terminate services entirely 
in october  we received notification from nextel that it would be terminating the services agreement effective january  in february  we entered into a settlement agreement and disentanglement transition plan the plan with nextel that resolved certain disputed matters in connection with the termination of the services agreement 
under the plan  we continued to provide services to nextel callers through march  in return for the payment by nextel of approximately million 
those payments were in addition to million previously paid by nextel in december in connection with the transition and in addition to the contractual payments by nextel for normal service provided by us to nextel callers through the transition period 
calls from nextel were substantially transitioned away from us by march   and we have received all amounts due from nextel 
including the million received in the first quarter of as part of the settlement payments  nextel represented approximately of our revenues in nextel accounted for approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
our contract with at t wireless expired in december the call volume from at t wireless transitioned away during the second and third quarters of at t wireless accounted for approximately of our revenues in terminations of the contracts noted above have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
restructuring and exit activities 
in  we undertook significant restructuring activities  due primarily to the departure of call volume from nextel as discussed above 
during  we closed call centers and significantly reduced the number of call center and administrative employees 
as a result of the closure and other restructuring activities  we paid or accrued approximately million of termination and retention benefits 
we also recorded approximately million of expenses related to termination of lease obligations of closed facilities during in addition  we recorded approximately million of other costs  primarily legal and advisory services and dismantling costs in included in these costs were losses incurred on disposal  in the second quarter  of certain corporate and call center assets in the amount of  these assets had a net book value totaling  at the time of disposal  and we received proceeds of  from the sale 
at december   we had approximately  of accrued restructuring costs  primarily related to remaining lease obligations of closed facilities and accrued termination benefits related to certain corporate employees 
approximately  of termination benefits was paid subsequent to december  with the remainder of the accrued restructuring costs expected to be paid out primarily during the second quarter of primarily during the second and third quarters of  as part of our ongoing efforts to cut costs and align expenses with reduced revenues  we closed and consolidated the operations of of our call centers 
most significant costs associated with closing those call centers were accrued and paid in during  we incurred approximately million of restructuring costs 
that amount consisted of approximately million of severance and other employee related termination benefits  approximately million of lease termination costs and approximately million of other costs of restructuring 
these other costs included approximately million of net non cash intangible and other asset write offs related to our discontinued infone service  approximately  paid for strategic advisory services  approximately  of costs associated with closing call centers  and approximately  of other costs 
significant new contract 
in august  we entered into a telecom information services agreement the agreement with jingle networks  inc jingle 
under the agreement  we will be a preferred directory assistance provider for free 
in addition to per call charges  the agreement includes financial commitments from jingle based on call volume expansion and other financial incentives 
the agreement is for three years and will automatically renew annually for up to two additional years unless either party provides notice of termination at least days prior to the commencement of such renewal period 
under the agreement  as a preferred directory provider we will be allocated no fewer calls than any other vendor providing similar services 
the agreement provides that our status as a preferred provider may be terminated by jingle but  in such event  the warrants described below will be terminated 
in connection with the agreement  we issued to jingle two warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the first warrant was for the purchase of up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was exercisable under the condition that jingle meet certain revenue and payment thresholds through february  the revenue targets were not met  thus  the first warrant terminated on february  the second warrant is for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  provided  however  that shares represented by the sum of the first and second warrants  if exercised  cannot exceed of our total shares outstanding after the warrants are exercised 
the exercise price for the second warrant will equal of the average closing price per share of the our common stock over the consecutive trading days ending the last trading day prior to july  the second warrant will not be exercisable unless and until certain revenue and payment thresholds are achieved by jingle during specified time periods as outlined in the agreement 
the second warrant terminates on july  other in a decision  the california public utilities commission puc implemented competitive wholesale pricing for directory assistance data for third party vendors purchasing the data from sbc communications sbc 
the decision determined that sbc continues to enjoy a dominant position as the former monopoly provider of local exchange service in its territory in california and could not use its market power to extract excessive directory assistance data prices that would discriminate against competitors 
the decision required that sbc refund the improper charges with interest 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we received a refund from sbc in the amount of approximately million that is included in other income  net in our december  statement of operations 
infone competition in the telecommunications industry  and in the directory assistance market in which we participate  is and has been intense 
with slowing subscriber growth and declining revenue per user  carriers are looking to lower their costs of providing directory assistance and other services through  among other ways  outsourcing to low cost domestic or overseas operators and utilizing automation to reduce costs 
in response to these and other issues  in may  we launched infone  a service that provided enhanced directory and personal assistant services directly to consumers 
the initial launch of infone was accompanied by a significant nationwide marketing and promotion campaign designed to build brand awareness and encourage customers to sign up for infone 
because of our inability to attract a significant number of subscribers to this service  it was discontinued in december we spent approximately million and million  in and  respectively  on such marketing and promotion campaigns 
revenues from our infone service were not significant in relation to total revenues in or results of operations the following table shows selected items of our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues direct operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment loss restructuring charges loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss compared to revenues 
revenues decreased to million from million 
call volume decreased to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these decreases resulted primarily from lower call volumes due to the termination of our services to nextel communications in march in addition  our overall average revenue per call was approximately in compared to approximately in primarily due to lower prices on renewals of existing contracts due to competitive pressures 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  consisting of the costs of salaries  wages  benefits and taxes of call center personnel  listings data and content acquisition costs  decreased to million from million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and data cost associated with servicing lower call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses decreased to from  due primarily to increased operational efficiencies in the call centers as a result of our cost control initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization decreased to million from million resulting primarily from cost cutting efforts in response to the termination of our contract with nextel  including the closing of call centers 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in compared to in primarily due to lower revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to overall reduction in acquisition of fixed assets in and the last several years as operations have been reduced

restructuring charges in consisted primarily of one time termination benefits paid to employees of million  lease termination costs of million and million of other costs 
other costs consisted primarily of legal and advisory costs  costs to dismantle closed call centers  and costs to implement our ongoing cost reduction plans 
these restructuring charges related primarily to the call centers we closed in and other cost cutting efforts at our corporate headquarters 
restructuring charges of approximately  primarily related to one time termination benefits and continuing lease obligations on closed facilities  have been accrued but not paid at december  other income  net 
other income in was approximately  consisting primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents partially offset by a charge of approximately  for penalties and interest on certain disputed federal and state income tax assessments and other miscellaneous non operating expenses 
income taxes 
income tax expense in was  primarily related to state income taxes 
income tax expense in was  reflecting a provision for federal income tax expense related to a proposed adjustment by the internal revenue service irs relating to a prior year tax return under audit 
our effective tax rates for and were approximately and  respectively 
the rates for both years differ from the statutory rates primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance  as it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased to million from million 
call volume decreased to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these decreases resulted primarily from lower call volumes due to the expiration of our contract with at t wireless in mid as well as a lower average revenue per call related to decreased pricing in our new contract with nextel in our overall average revenue per call was approximately in compared to approximately in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  consisting of the costs of salaries  wages  benefits and taxes of call center personnel  listings data and content acquisition costs  decreased to million from million

other costs consisted primarily of costs to dismantle closed call centers  costs to implement our ongoing cost reduction plans  and non cash write downs of certain intangible and other assets related to our discontinued infone service 
these restructuring charges related primarily to the call centers we closed in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to the write down of fixed assets in the fourth quarter of and the overall reduction in acquisition of fixed assets in the last several years as operations have been reduced 
other income  net 
other income in was approximately million and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
other income in was approximately million  consisting primarily of the million refund from sbc discussed above and approximately  of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
income taxes 
income tax expense in was  reflecting a provision for federal income tax expense related to a proposed adjustment by the irs relating to a prior year tax return under audit 
income tax benefit in was million 
this benefit resulted primarily from our ability to carry losses back to offset income in prior years and to receive refunds of income taxes paid in those years 
our effective tax rate for was approximately 
our effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of approximately 
the rates for both years differ from the statutory rates primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance in both years  as it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash are recorded at cost which approximates their fair market value 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash including million of restricted cash compared to approximately million including million of restricted cash at december  the net decrease of million resulted primarily from net operating losses 
we have no outstanding debt 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  this change was primarily due to net operating losses incurred in cash flow from operations 
net cash used in operations in was million compared to net cash used of million in  accordingly  we used approximately million less cash in operations in as compared to the decrease in cash used was primarily as follows we paid million less to or on behalf of employees and we paid million less to suppliers of goods and services  including advertising services  in versus offsetting these decreases in cash payments were decreases in cash received from customers of million and in cash refunds of federal income taxes of million cash flow from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from release of cash used to secure a letter of credit and cash proceeds from the sale of excess equipment and other assets  partially offset by cash used for capital purchases 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from conversion of short term investments to cash for use in operations  partially offset by cash used to secure a letter of credit and cash used for capital purchases 
in and  capital expenditures were primarily for equipment to upgrade existing call centers and corporate networks and infrastructure 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was not significant in or future capital needs and resources 
the primary uses of our capital in the near future are expected to be primarily for working capital 
we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities in order to address varying business circumstances  including changes in volume and pricing and other provisions of customer contracts 
although cash on hand including restricted cash and short term investments at december  was approximately million  our operations and future activities  including additional restructuring efforts  will reduce available cash 
our existing cash and cash equivalents will likely not be sufficient to fund our operations for the remainder of or beyond 
our management is aggressively pursuing new and additional sources of revenues and is working to grow our voice and data services businesses 
over the past two years  we have significantly reduced the direct cost of delivering our services as well as significantly reduced our general and administrative overhead  however  in order to continue as a going concern  we will need to significantly increase our revenues and or further reduce our costs and or obtain additional financing 
in addition  our management and board of directors are investigating and pursuing strategic alternatives for the company to improve operations  improve liquidity and capital resources  and provide stability to the company s financial position 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts in these areas will be successful 
in such event  we may attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity  although we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to execute our operations according to our plans or obtain additional financing  we may be forced to cease operations 
contractual obligations and commitments 
our contractual obligations are presented in the table below 
other than operating leases  we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 
payments due by period in thousands less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations total we generally lease our facilities through non cancelable operating leases extending for up to ten years 
from time to time  in the normal course of our business  we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   we had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of  related to our workers compensation program 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit for the same amount that is recorded as restricted cash 
this commitment expires on april  and is typically renewed on an annual basis 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these contractual obligations and commitments are not reflected in our balance sheets 
effect of inflation inflation did not materially affect our business during the last several years 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements  those governing accounts receivable  the lives and recoverability of the carrying amount of equipment and other long lived assets  such as existing intangible assets  estimates involving the levels of our contingent liabilities for workers compensation and medical self insurance and estimates of current taxes owed may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation and uncertainty 
accounts receivable 
our wholesale customer base has primarily consisted of large wireless telephone carriers in the united states 
as such  we have had minimal risk of uncollectibility  at any point in time  related to outstanding accounts receivable with these customers 
we have not experienced significant collection issues or write offs related to these customers 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few of these wholesale customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of them could adversely impact collection of our accounts receivable and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results 
in addition  our data services business is generating receivables from customers that may not be as financially stable as our large carrier customers which to date has not but may in the future expose us to greater risk of uncollectible receivables than we have experienced in the past 
long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including patents and trademarks and internally developed software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
at such time  we estimate the future cash flows expected from use of such assets and their eventual disposition and  if lower than the carrying amounts  adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
because of our changing business conditions  including lower wholesale prices and dependence on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues  our estimates of future cash flows to be generated from our operations could change materially  resulting in the need for us to record additional impairment charges 
in addition  as a result of our changing business conditions  we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities 
if any of these activities result in certain of our assets no longer being used in operations  we may need to record an additional impairment charge 
as a result of certain of the circumstances noted above  we evaluated our fixed assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as of december  we determined that the value of our fixed assets was impaired  thus  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million write down of those assets to their estimated fair market value 
as a result of the decision by nextel to terminate its contract with us  as discussed under significant events above  and because of continuing operating losses  we evaluated our fixed assets and intangibles as of december  and for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
our evaluation determined that the assets were not impaired as of december  and self insurance reserves 
in the past  we have self insured a portion of our workers compensation and employee medical insurance programs 
in some periods we purchased stop loss coverage at varying levels in order to mitigate our potential future losses 
the nature of the liabilities associated with these self insurance programs  which may not fully manifest themselves for several years  requires significant judgment 
we evaluate open workers compensation and medical claims under these policies periodically to determine the reasonableness of the reserves we have recorded for such claims 
our evaluation includes estimates of potential incurred but unreported claims as well as factors that may cause original estimates of such claims to increase over time  such as available claims data and historical trends and experience  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
we adjust these reserves if events or changes in circumstances indicate that ultimate payments related to the claims will be more than the recorded reserves 
at december   we have reserved approximately million and  related to these self insured workers compensation and medical programs  respectively 
while we believe that the amounts reserved for these obligations are sufficient  any significant change in the status of open claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
due to differences in the recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we estimate the likelihood of recovery of these assets  which is dependent on future levels of profitability and enacted tax rates 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  we would be required to take a charge to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets  which could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december  and  a valuation allowance reduced net deferred tax assets to zero 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 
this framework is intended to increase consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit  or in some cases require  estimates of fair market value 
sfas no 
also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a company s use of fair value measurements  including the effect of such measures on earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid resources are invested in money market instruments and short term debt securities 
however  these funds were invested in overnight money market instruments or debt securities with short term effective maturities at december  and were redeemable on a daily or monthly basis 
therefore  the fair market value of these investments is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
all of the underlying investments in the money market fund had maturities of three months or less 
a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
