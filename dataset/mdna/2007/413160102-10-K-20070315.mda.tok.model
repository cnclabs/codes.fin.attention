item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells products and systems that enable network operators to efficiently deliver broadcast and on demand video services that include digital video  video on demand and high definition television  as well as high speed internet access and telephony 
historically  the majority of our revenues have been derived from sales of video processing solutions and edge and access systems to cable television operators 
we also provide our video processing solutions to direct broadcast satellite operators and to telephone companies  or telcos  that offer video services to their customers 
harmonic s net sales decreased in from and increased in from the decrease in sales in compared to was primarily due to a reduction in sales of fttp and third party products in which have significantly lower gross margins than our other products 
the increase in net sales in reflected an improved industry capital spending environment worldwide which favorably impacted harmonic 
we believe that this improvement in the industry capital spending environment was  in part  a result of the intensifying competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and hdtv  and in part the result of the entry of telephone companies into the business of delivering video services to their subscribers 
we also believe that the improvement was due to more favorable conditions in industry capital markets and the completion or resolution of certain major business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
sales to comcast accounted for  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
in  net sales decreased by compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower fttp sales and sales of third party products 
although sales decreased in compared to  there was a significant increase in deferred revenue and backlog which was the result of an increase in the number of projects and orders received for which product shipment was not made during harmonic reported net income of million in which was primarily the result of higher gross margins 
the improved gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher gross margins from new products and an increase in the proportion of net sales from software and services 
we also reduced our sales of fttp and third party products  which have significantly lower gross margins than our other products 
cost of sales and operating expenses include an expense for stock based compensation of million related to the adoption of sfas r 
restructuring charges totaling million were recorded in as a result of a management reorganization and a sunnyvale campus consolidation 
in  net sales increased by compared to  but our operating results were negatively impacted by a decrease in our gross margin percentage  which was primarily the result of lower margin on fttp sales and sales of third party products  as well as the write down of inventories  resulting in a net loss of million for the year 
our operating results in included a charge of million for severance costs from the consolidation of the two 
table of contents divisions and the manufacturing operation into a single operating segment  and a benefit of million from the reversal of previously recorded excess facility costs due to subleasing an excess facility 
prior to  harmonic was organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
effective january   an organizational restructuring combined the company s cs division and ban division into a single segment with financial results reported as a single segment as of the first quarter of based on the changes to the structure of our internal organization  we have restated the segment information for prior periods that are included in this annual report on form k to reflect our current organization structure 
harmonic often recognizes a significant portion  or the majority  of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
as a result of uncertain market conditions and lower sales during and  we recorded severance charges totaling million during and related to severance and other costs 
an improved business environment in led us to increase headcount to at the end of in  we added employees as a result of the acquisition of btl 
in the fourth quarter of  due to an organizational restructuring that combined our product development  marketing and manufacturing operations into a single segment  harmonic reduced its workforce by approximately employees and recorded severance charges of approximately million 
the acquisition of entone in the fourth quarter of increased our headcount by employees  primarily in research and development 
in may  the company s board of directors appointed patrick j 
harshman as president and chief executive officer  replacing anthony ley  who retired after years 
mr 
ley continues to serve on as a consultant to the company and as chairman of its board of directors 
following dr 
harshman s appointment  the company announced a reorganization of its senior management  resulting in a charge of approximately million in severance costs in the second quarter of in and excess facilities charges totaling million were recorded due to the company s reduced headcount  difficult business conditions and a weak local commercial real estate market 
the excess facilities charges were for facilities that we no longer occupied  did not intend to occupy and plan to sublease 
in the excess facilities liability was reduced by million due to a revision in the assumptions as to the unoccupied portion of a building 
in the fourth quarter of  the excess facilities liability was decreased by million due to subleasing a portion of the unoccupied portion of one building for the remainder of the lease 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its facilities rationalization plan resulting in more efficient use of our sunnyvale campus and vacated several buildings  some of which were subsequently subleased 
this resulted in a net charge for excess facilities of million in the third quarter of although we entered into new subleases for approximately  square feet of space in   square feet of space in and approximately  square feet of space in  in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents on february   harmonic purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of broadcast technology ltd  or btl  a private uk company  for a total purchase consideration of million  or approximately million 
the purchase consideration consisted of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock 
btl develops  manufactures and distributes professional video audio receivers and decoders and had approximately employees at the time of the acquisition 
we recently discontinued a btl decoder product line and closed our manufacturing operations in the uk on december   harmonic completed its acquisition of the video networking software business of entone for a total purchase consideration of million 
the purchase consideration consisted of a payment of million  the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock with a value of million and issuance of  options to purchase harmonic common stock with a value of million 
prior to the closing of the acquisition  entone spun off its consumer premises equipment  or cpe  business into a separate private company 
as part of the terms of the acquisition agreement pursuant to which harmonic acquired the video networking software business of entone  harmonic is obligated to purchase a convertible note with a face amount of million in the new spun off private company subject to its closing of an initial round of equity financing in which at least million is invested by third parties 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below n revenue recognition  n allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  n valuation of inventories  n impairment of long lived assets  n restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  n assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  n accounting for income taxes  and n stock based compensation 
revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements are recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title have transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our international distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the criteria in eitf  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the criteria in eitf to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
for multiple element arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  harmonic evaluates the arrangement based on eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for as software 
software related elements include all 
table of contents non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  harmonic accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
fair value of software related elements is based on separate sales to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
revenue on solution sales  which principally consist of and include the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of equipment to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of internal labor costs expended to date to anticipated final internal labor costs  based on current estimates of internal labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon separate sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical usage 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 

table of contents impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis and of intangibles and other long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of other intangible assets and long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
our review of intangibles in determined that the remaining balance of million of the intangibles acquired as a result of the btl acquisition in february had been impaired 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  we recorded restructuring costs when harmonic committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
harmonic determines the excess facilities accrual based on estimates of expected sublease rental income for each excess facility 
for restructuring activities initiated after december   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
at december   our accrual for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
if it is not more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance 
at december  we have fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and held a valuation allowance of million 
while the adoption of sfas no 
r did not materially affect our effective tax rate in fiscal  our effective tax rate in future periods may be significantly impacted 
sfas no 
r requires that the tax benefit of stock options deductions relating to incentive stock options be recorded in the period of disqualifying disposition 
this could result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate between accounting periods 
in addition  the effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by foreign stock option expense that may not be deductible in the foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations  and the required pro forma disclosures prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas as amended 
in addition  we have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission  in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee equity awards and employee stock purchases 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee equity awards and employee stock purchases recognized during the year ended december  sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for employee equity awards and employee stock purchases using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations because the exercise price of the company s stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of stock based compensation costs to expense from the accelerated multiple option method to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards related to stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted subsequent to december  are recognized using the straight line method 

table of contents as stock based compensation expense recognized in our results for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred for the purposes of pro forma information under sfas  as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the related periods 
the fair value of share based payment awards is estimated at grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as the assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp r 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method provides a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of fsp r did not have an impact on our overall consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with prior years  we use the with and without approach as described in eitf topic no 
d in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also consistent with prior years  we consider the indirect effects of the windfall deduction on the computation of other tax attributes  such as the r d credit and the domestic production activities deduction  as an additional component of equity 
this incremental tax effect is recorded to additional paid in capital when realized

harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately to million during under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger liabilities remained outstanding at december  and are included in accrued liabilities 
these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger obligations to various authorities in countries 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired c cube s spun off semiconductor business from us in june and assumed its obligations  to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in although we expect to make payments in for these liabilities  including a payment of million harmonic made in january  we are unable to predict when the remaining obligations will be paid 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the million pre merger liability balance after the january payments  lsi is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
harmonic has a bank line credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million  including million for equipment under a secured term loan 
this facility  which was amended and restated in december  expires on march  and contains financial and other covenants including the requirement for harmonic to maintain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or satisfy the additional affirmative covenant requirements  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
the december amendment resulted in the company paying a fee of approximately  and requiring payment of approximately  of additional fees if the company does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with the bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or prime plus for equipment borrowings

we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger liabilities 
we are also in the process of renewing our bank line credit facility which would further enhance our liquidity sources 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
in april  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec 
pursuant to this registration statement on form s  which has been declared effective by the sec  we are able to issue various types of registered securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in capital markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net sales in and of net sales in in addition  the company has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million that matured within the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 

table of contents interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows in
