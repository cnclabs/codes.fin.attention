overview the year was a successful and much improved year for transact as compared to during  we marked our tenth year as a publicly traded company by achieving a record level of sales 
we also shipped a record  printers during  led by our top selling epic r casino printer 
in addition to our financial success  some of our other key accomplishments for include the following extending our sales contract through with gtech for the purchase of our lottery printers extending our strategic sales alliance through with eurocoin  one of europe s leading suppliers of products for the amusement and gaming industries  to sell our gaming and casino printers in europe and africa receiving three new patents  including another key patent in connection with dual port technology partnering with merley paper converters ltd  the uk s largest independent manufacturer of receipt paper rolls  for exclusive us distribution rights for thermal receipt paper that has true full color images printed on the front or back under our newly created poweroll tm brand signing an agreement with a leading national office supply chain to supply inkjet cartridges with an expected annual sales value of million we continue to focus on sales growth in our two core markets  pos and banking and gaming and lottery  and in our transact services group  to drive increased profitability

del pos and banking   gaming and lottery    transact services group    total net sales  del 
we experienced an increase of approximately in sales of pos and banking printers in although we experienced increases in sales of our line of thermal printers and our bankjet r printers to existing banking customers  these increases were largely offset by lower sales of our legacy line of pos impact printers  as these printers are being replaced by our newer thermal and inkjet printers 
our sales into the pos and banking market over the last several years have been impacted by a market shift in technology from impact printing to thermal and inkjet printing 
this change in technology has resulted in declining sales of our impact printers that were at higher average selling prices and increasing sales of our thermal and inkjet printers that are at lower average selling prices 
although our unit sales volume has increased over the last several years  the revenue generated from those sales have not increased to the same extent due to lower average selling prices of thermal and inkjet printers as compared to impact printers 
in fact  since  unit sales of all of our printers  including pos and banking printers  have more than doubled  while average selling prices of these printers have declined by approximately 
we expect sales of legacy impact printers to continue to decline 
in  we plan to focus a substantial portion of our engineering and product development resources on continuing to expand our portfolio of pos printers 
with the global pos printer market of approximately million  we have many opportunities for market share gains  primarily through increasing and enhancing our product portfolio  increasing geographic coverage  and growing our customer base 
our focus in the gaming and lottery market is two fold 
on the lottery side  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreement with gtech corporation gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with approximately a market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
in fact  during  we extended our contract with gtech through currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades worldwide 
during  we experienced solid sales growth from gtech  with total printer sales increasing by approximately  or  compared to however  our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
on the gaming side  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks  as well as in other gaming devices that print tickets  primarily in the united states  europe and australia  as well as in the emerging asian market  including macau 
during  our domestic gaming printer sales increased by from  as we gained market share in the us casino market due to our strategic alliance agreement with jcm american corporation  the worldwide leading bill acceptor company  to sell our casino printers  increased sales to igt  the world s largest slot machine manufacturer  and expanded acceptance of our new epic r thermal casino printer 
with the success of our epic r thermal casino printer  and our expanding portfolio of patented technology on this printer  including dual port technology  we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our market share in the north american slot machine market  which now stands at over  slot machines 
in the international gaming market  we experienced our third consecutive record sales year in  as our international gaming sales increased by to million  largely due to sales growth from the australian market 
we expect continued strength from gaming sales internationally during  as markets such as europe  australia and asia including macau continue to adopt and or expand ticket printing for slot machines and other gaming machines  and as our new line of epic printers launched in for the off premise gaming market begin to take hold 
our transact services group tsg  which sells service  replacement parts and consumable products  including receipt paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  continues to offer a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
even with declining sales of replacement parts for legacy impact printers as the installed base of these printers in the market declines  tsg revenue reached a record  or of net sales in  representing an increase of from during  our sales benefited from increased sales from our maintenance services  including extended warranty contracts and our innovative hour guaranteed replacement product service called transact xpress sm 
in addition  our sales benefited from higher inkjet cartridge sales including incremental sales resulting from the signing of an agreement with a leading national office supply chain to supply inkjet cartridges 
during  we also partnered with merley paper converters ltd  the uk s largest independent manufacturer of receipt paper rolls  to distribute exclusively in the us specialized thermal receipt paper that will have true full color images printed on the front or back 
this receipt paper  that we will market under our newly created poweroll tm brand  will allow users the ability to leverage the receipt for branding and marketing purposes  while also helping to reduce copied receipt fraud 
we remain focused on continuing to grow the lucrative tsg in and expect these initiatives to contribute to our growth 
operationally  our gross margin and operating margin showed marked improvement during  reflecting the investment we made in the growth elements of our business during during  our gross margin improved to compared to in  and our operating margin also improved to compared to just in overall  we reported net income of million and earnings per share diluted of per share for we also generated sufficient cash during to fund million of capital expenditures  repurchase million of our common stock approximately of our common stock outstanding and finish the year with million of cash and no debt on our balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  restructuring accruals  share based compensation and contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell spare parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within sab  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to ftb  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for amounts received from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customer s price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have not been material 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
we charge our customers for shipping and handling services 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from three customers of approximately  and  respectively  of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from one customer of of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we assess market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changing market conditions 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
as of december   our net inventory included a reserve of  or of gross inventory  to write inventory down to lower of cost or market 
goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  and we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance or tax reserve  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which will be effective the first quarter of based on the more likely than not standard under fin  we expect that this guidance may impact the company s recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
however  the company has not yet finalized its assessment of fin as of december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately  net of a valuation allowance of  and a tax reserve of  primarily on portions of certain tax credits 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  based on our projection of future taxable income  no additional valuation allowance is considered necessary 
should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility the consolidation 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford operations to ithaca  ny  with the exception of our corporate headquarters and a service center that remains in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the related termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in  we recorded significant accruals 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of expenses associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs 
management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
during november  we executed an agreement  effective may   to terminate the lease agreement for our wallingford  ct facility 
as a result  we changed our estimate of the restructuring accrual and reversed approximately  of restructuring expenses in we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
warranty we generally warrant our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to fas on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
if the actual liabilities are settled in an amount greater than those recorded on the balance sheet  a change to income would be recorded 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payment as amended using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  and the stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly

recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for income tax uncertainties in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which will be effective the first quarter of based on the more likely than not standard under fin  we expect that this guidance may impact the company s recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
however  the company has not yet finalized its assessment of fin effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements 
sab no 
requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab no 
is effective for our fiscal year annual financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fasb which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
because the guidance was recently issued  management has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of fasb on the company s financial position and results of operations 
resource sufficiency we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the new td banknorth credit facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs  including costs associated with the consolidation  to finance our capital expenditures  to fund our stock repurchase program  and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
c impact of inflation transact believes that its business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends because of the low rate of inflation during the past three years  nor does it believe it will be significantly affected by inflation during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an effective increase or decrease of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows
