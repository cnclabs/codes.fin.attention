we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on gaap measures  we focus on modified ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or debt extinguishment costs if any during the relevant measurement period  provision for income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
then we exclude derivative instrument income or expense  debt discount expense  share based compensation expense  and asset impairment charges these measures eliminate the effect of financing transactions that we enter into on an irregular basis based on capital needs and market opportunities  and these measures provide us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our growth 
in comparing modified ebitda from year to year  we also ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as modified ebitda 
because modified ebitda is a non gaap financial measure  we include in the tables below reconciliations of modified ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we present modified ebitda because we believe it provides useful information regarding our ability to meet our future debt payment requirements  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  and that it provides an overall evaluation of our financial condition 
in addition  modified ebitda is defined in certain financial covenants under our senior secured convertible notes and may be used to adjust the interest rate on those notes at july  and january  and determine whether the holders of those notes have a redemption right at may  
table of contents modified ebitda has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be used as a substitute for net income  cash flows or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or as a measure of our profitability or our liquidity 
when evaluating modified ebitda as a performance measure  and excluding the above noted items  all of which have material limitations  investors should consider  among other factors  the following increasing or decreasing trends in modified ebitda  how modified ebitda compares to levels of debt and interest expense 
because modified ebitda  as defined  excludes some but not all items that affect our net income  modified ebitda may not be comparable to a similarly titled performance measure presented by other companies

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our growth and future operating results  development of products  sales and intellectual property 
for this purpose  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward looking statement 
we often used the words believe  anticipate  plan  expect  intend  may  will and similar expressions to help identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for this reason  the data in this section may not be comparable to discussions and data in previously filed annual and quarterly reports 
executive summary we are a leading provider of innovative  automated traffic enforcement systems and services to state and local governments throughout the united states and canada 
we are the only provider of both a fully video based automated red light enforcement system and a multi lane  bi directional scanning light detection and ranging  or lidar  speed enforcement system 
we also offer a newly developed vidar speed detection and imaging system as complement to our other products or as a stand alone speed enforcement system 
crossingguard  our red light enforcement product  uses our patented image processing technology to predict and record the occurrence of a red light violation  and manages the process of issuing and processing a citation 
poliscan  one of our speed enforcement products  uses technology developed by vitronic gmbh 
we have exclusive distribution rights to poliscan in north america through february  subject to meeting certain purchase minimums 
vidar uses average speed over distance calculations to detect and record evidence of speeding vehicles 
because vidar was developed by in house talent  there are no purchase minimums 
by combining crossingguard  poliscan and vidar with citation composer  our proprietary citation preparation and processing software  we are able to provide fully integrated  turnkey red light and speed enforcement solutions 
we generate recurring revenue through contracts that provide for equipment leasing and services on a fixed and or per citation fee basis 
essentially all of our revenue prior to september  was generated through contracts for our crossingguard red light system as explained below 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started generating revenue from our poliscan speed system 
the economics of products and services are tied to the number of operating systems in the field and the number of violations processed by such systems 
customer pricing entails fixed monthly fees  variable per ticket fee pricing structures  or a combination of both 
because fixed fees are based upon the expected level of violations over the contract term  the shift to monthly fixed fee contracts may result in a more stable revenue stream for those installations 
many of our initial red light and speed contracts  however  compensate us on a per ticket paid or issued basis in return for both equipment lease and maintenance and citation processing and customer support services 
depending on the terms of each contract  we realize from to per citation issued or paid and or fixed monthly fees ranging from  to  per approach for system delivery and processing services 
state statutes providing for automated enforcement may impose liability on either the driver or the registered owner of a vehicle for a violation 
driver liability statutes require that the driver be identified  from the photographic evidence  and that the citation be issued and sent to the driver 
registered owner statutes require that the vehicle s owner be identified  through registration records  and that the citation be issued and sent to the registered owner 
because only the license plate is required for identification under a registered owner statute  program operating efficiencies are much higher  resulting in lower per citation costs and monthly fees for crossingguard systems installed in these jurisdictions 
of the twenty four jurisdictions that currently allow for automated red light enforcement programs  five require that a driver be identified  the other states limit identification to the vehicle license plate and impose liability on the registered owner 
driver identification states are generally in the western part of the us  and include california  arizona  oregon  utah  and colorado 

table of contents almost all of our contracts provide for the lease of equipment and the services as a bundled  turnkey program over three to five years 
the equipment leases are generally classified as operating leases under fas accounting for leases and the revenues are realized along with service revenues as services are delivered to a customer over the life of the contract 
one contract with delaware dot provided for a monthly lease of the roadside equipment  and we transferred this lease to ge municipal services for the face value of the roadside equipment  or  per approach 
in accordance with fas  this lease qualified as a sales type financing lease and we recognized the value received from the leased equipment  and expensed the associated costs of the system in the same period 
we delivered and systems to delaware dot in and  respectively  and have completed deliveries of units under the current contract terms 
our existing crossingguard contracts with government entities typically authorize the installation of systems at a specified number of approaches 
as of december   our existing active contracts authorized the installation of our crossingguard product at up to an additional approaches 
management believes the majority of the authorized approaches under existing active contracts will be installed  but no assurances can be given that all approaches under contract will ultimately be installed due to factors including locating qualifying intersections  budget or personnel considerations  etc 
the following table provides summary information regarding our active crossingguard contracts 
december  number of approaches and units installed  operational and revenue generating crossingguard red light approaches poliscan speed units additional authorized approaches crossingguard red light approaches poliscan speed units total on october   we deployed the first of four approved poliscan systems in the city of akron  ohio 
we receive fees from per ticket paid to of the ticket fine paid under the existing speed agreements with our customers 
we expect that a majority of any future speed enforcement contracts will compensate us on a per ticket paid basis in return for both equipment lease and citation processing and customer support services 
we anticipate that we will generally receive fees from to per ticket under future speed enforcement contracts depending on factors including number of units ordered  length of contract  service levels provided  state statutes  and competition 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
we may incur significant expenses in anticipation of revenue  which may not materialize and we may not be able to reduce spending quickly if our revenue is lower than expected 
in addition  our ability to forecast revenue  particularly with respect to our new speed products  is limited 
as a result  our operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include costs related to customization of our products and services  announcements or introductions of new products and services by our competitors  the failure of additional states to adopt or maintain legislation enabling the use of automated traffic enforcement systems  determinations by state and local government bodies to utilize our equipment without the additional processing services we provide  equipment defects and other product quality problems  a shift towards fixed rate  as opposed to per ticket  compensation arrangements for our speed products  which could adversely affect revenues  the discretionary nature of our customers internal evaluation  approval and order processes  the varying size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products and services  and the mix of revenue from our products and services 

table of contents during our first years of operations  we developed a number of patented intelligent software solutions for decision and data mining applications  including financial services  fraud detection and intelligent traffic management systems 
in  we made the strategic decision to concentrate on our traffic management technologies and began to dispose of our other product lines 
by  we had exited our financial services  fraud detection and rail crossingguard and trafficvision business lines  and had refocused our resources on our traffic safety and enforcement systems such as crossingguard  our current primary source of revenue 
this transition involved a series of licensing arrangements and transfers of our rights 
in early  we also entered into two separate source code licensing agreements for our fraud detection product line appointing applied communications  inc  or aci  and retail decisions  inc  or red  as co exclusive resellers in the transaction processing industry 
royalty revenues from aci continued through june when the royalty stream was assigned to churchill lane associates  or cla 
we do not expect to receive future revenues from this license 
additionally  we transferred to red certain of our assets that supported the technology licensed under our license to red 
no ongoing revenues are expected to be realized from red 
the licensing  royalty and other payments we received under these licensing arrangements and other transfers of our property and technology financed our operations during and and enabled us to develop our traffic enforcement business 
on august   we acquired certain assets of transol usa  one of our competitors  in a foreclosure sale 
the assets included contracts to provide automated red light enforcement services in six us cities at an aggregate of red light approaches  as well as related equipment  intellectual property  inventory  work in process  accounts receivable and unbilled contract revenue related to transol s red light enforcement services 
we paid million for the acquired assets 
we funded the acquisition of the acquired assets with internal working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
for more information  see note to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements sab  revenue is generally recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied a persuasive evidence of sales arrangements exist  b delivery has occurred  c the sales price is fixed or determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
in those cases where all four criteria are not met  we defer recognition of revenue until the period these criteria are satisfied 
the majority of our revenue is derived from three types of customer arrangements a 
we provide hardware and equipment  and related third party embedded software roadside systems 
the third party embedded software is considered incidental to the system as a whole 
in these arrangements  we typically sell or lease the system as a stand alone roadside system and account for it either as a direct sale  in one instance as a sales type lease  as it met the criteria of a sales type lease in financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
accounting for leases  or in most other cases as an operating lease accounted for on a monthly basis 
for each arrangement  usually upon delivery for the sales type lease or monthly for operating type leases  revenue is recognized as there exists evidence that an arrangement exists  the system is delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with sab  b 
we provide services  which typically include citation processing  back office and hosting services 
software is more than incidental to the services as a whole  but is used by us to capture and internally process the violations and customers do not have the right to and do not take possession of our detection and tracking  or our citation processing and back office software 
for these services  we typically recognize revenue on a fixed monthly fee or a per citation fee basis 
revenue usually commences for these service arrangements  upon the first month after inception of operations  as there exists evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or delivered citations and other services are delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured  and 
table of contents c 
for two current customers who want to process their own citations  we lease them our detection and tracking and citation processing and back office software and provide monthly customer support on the software 
for this arrangement  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition 
although all software deliverables are complete in the initial month of operations  and the monthly customer support is the only undelivered element  we recognize revenue on a monthly basis as the citations are issued or paid 
some contracts include penalty provisions relating to timely performance and delivery of systems and services by us 
penalties are charged to operations in the period the penalty is determinable  if incurred 
unbilled contract revenue unbilled contract revenue represents revenue earned by us in advance of being billable under customer contract terms 
under the terms of some current contracts  we cannot bill the municipality until the court has collected the citation fine 
through september   management recorded unbilled contract revenue in these situations at a net amount  based upon a historical pattern of collections by the courts for the municipalities 
the pattern of collections on these citations was periodically reviewed and updated by management 
based upon review of this policy during discussions with the securities and exchange examining division  management decided to defer recognition of income on these contracts until the municipality has collected the applicable citation to which we are entitled to a portion 
management implemented this change in the fourth quarter of and recorded a cumulative adjustment to reflect the change including a reduction of lease and service revenue and unbilled contract revenues of  allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in receivables  based on historical experience 
receivables are considered to be past due if they have not been paid by the payment due dates 
debts are written off against the allowance when deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
inventory obsolescence we evaluate our inventory for excess and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
in preparing our evaluation  we look at the expected demand for our products for the next three to twelve months in order to determine whether or not such equipment to be installed requires a change in the inventory reserve in order to record the inventory at net realizable value 
after discussions with the senior management team  a reserve is established so that inventory is appropriately stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
capitalization of internal buildout costs the company s crossingguard red light enforcement business requires us to install our technology in the communities that we serve 
to do this  the company deploys internal resources to design  help install  and configure its software and equipment in those communities ie buildout 
buildout costs are defined as directly related payroll  fringe  and related travel and entertainment expense 
those buildout costs are capitalizable as part of the cost of the system deployed under contract in a community we serve and depreciated over the life of the contract 
the company accumulates the amount of those internal buildout costs incurred on a quarterly basis and capitalizes them 
internal buildout costs capitalized in were approximately  and no costs were capitalized in and  as most buildout costs were out sourced in prior years 
share based compensation in the first quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payments sfas r  which required all share based payments to employees to be recognized in our financial statements at their fair value 
we have continued to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of options under sfas r and have elected to use the modified prospective transition method  in which prior period financial statements will not be restated but disclosure of the pro forma net loss calculation will be included in the footnotes to the financial statements for periods prior to fiscal and the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents the calculation of stock based compensation requires the use of a valuation model and related assumptions 
the use of the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including an estimate of the volatility of our stock  the expected life of our share based instruments  the expected forfeitures of share based instruments  the expected dividend rate on our common stock  and the risk free interest rates that can materially affect our fair value estimate of our share based instruments 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the calculation of stock based compensation 
derivative instruments in connection with the sale of debt or equity instruments  we may sell options or warrants to purchase our common stock 
in certain circumstances  these options or warrants may be classified as derivative liabilities  rather than as equity 
additionally  the debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments  such as variable conversion options  which in certain circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability 
the identification of  and accounting for  derivative instruments is complex 
derivative instrument liabilities are re valued at the end of each reporting period  with changes in fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income in the period in which the changes occur 
for options  warrants and bifurcated conversion options that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities  we determine the fair value of these instruments using the black sholes option pricing model  binomial stock price probability trees  or other valuation techniques  sometimes with the assistance of a certified valuation expert 
these models require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments and risk free rates of return  our current common stock price and expected dividend yield  and the expected volatility of our common stock price based on not only the history of our stock price but also the experience of other entities considered comparable to us 
the identification of  and accounting for  derivative instruments and the assumptions used to value them can significantly affect our financial statements 
long term asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our long term assets  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  contract renewal options and other factors to determine its fair value 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges that were not previously recorded 
during the year ended december   the company recorded impairment charges of  primarily related to its transol red light contracts 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable equity securities and trade accounts receivable 
we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
at times such investments may be in excess of the fdic limit 
however  senior management continually reviews the financial stability of these financial institutions 
we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers  most of which are municipalities  and  as a result  believe that our trade accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
we do not require collateral from our customers 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash position and working capital we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  at december  compared with  at december  at december   we had working capital of  compared with a working capital deficit of  at december  our net worth at december  was  compared with  at december  the  increase in cash is primarily due to i our private stock placement on january  that raised  net of expenses  and ii proceeds of  net of expenses  received from our placement of  in senior secured convertible notes on may  reduced by the repayment of existing debt of  and the return of  to the noteholders upon their exercise of their right to put back of the debt to the company at the end of the year 
these net proceeds were offset by iii cash used in our operations in the year of  and iv investments in capitalized systems of  which are expected to generate revenue in future periods 
the increase in net worth was primarily the result of the private stock placement discussed above offset by our twelve month net loss of  excluding stock compensation charges of  we continue to seek additional sources of equity and debt financing to fund operations and to position ourselves to capitalize on new market and growth opportunities  however  there can be no assurance that the funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
historically  we have raised capital by through a series of privately placed debt and equity transactions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   the company sold  shares of its common stock to fifteen accredited investors at per share raising  net of expenses and issued warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock exercisable at per share expiring on january  the company used  of the proceeds to immediately retire the heil secured promissory note 
among the purchasers was silver star partners  an affiliate of the company  which purchased  shares and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares 
on may   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with several institutional and accredited investors to sell  of units consisting of five year  senior secured convertible promissory notes  convertible into shares of the company s common stock  and five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  in a private placement pursuant to regulation d under the securities act of the transaction was closed on may  on march   the company entered into a note purchase agreement  which will be effective as of april   pursuant to which accredited investors some of whom are affiliates of the company agreed to purchase million of the company s variable rate senior notes due may  the speed notes  which speed notes are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the company s assets which are directly and exclusively used for the implementation and performance of existing entered into after october  and future contracts for fixed and mobile automated speed enforcement units 
speed note holders will receive interest payments equal to a per paid citation issued with the equipment for as issued contracts  b per paid citation for as paid contracts and c of amounts collected for fixed fee contracts  subject to a minimum return of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears 
payments will be made based upon citations issued from speed units per million in aggregate outstanding principal on all notes 
once the company has entered into contracts for the operation of speed units  the company may  but is not obligated to  sell an additional million of speed notes 
the speed notes will mature on may   at which time the company will pay all unpaid principal together with all accrued but unpaid interest 
the company may at any time redeem the speed notes at of face value plus accumulated but unpaid interest 

table of contents the proceeds from the speed notes will be used  either prospectively or retrospectively  to fund the purchase price or cost of design  engineering  installation  construction  configuring  maintenance  or operation or improvement of property or equipment used in contracts signed after october  at a customer site  including without limitation  costs of site analysis and preparation 
the foregoing is a summary only of the note purchase agreement and the speed notes 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual note purchase agreement with the form of speed note attached thereto in its entirety attached to this annual report as exhibit 
we continue to seek additional sources of equity and debt financing to fund system installations and to position ourselves to capitalize on new market and growth opportunities  however  there can be no assurance that the funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its cash flow in future periods payments due in operating leases senior convertible notes senior secured convertible notes debt interest total thereafter primarily facility lease obligations in providence  ri and los angeles  ca 
as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
for the twelve months ended december   we invested  in capitalized systems and no system costs were expensed under a sales type lease for delaware approaches compared to  invested in capitalized systems and  delaware system costs expensed in the same period last year 
management expects that nts will make substantial future commitments for systems related to our crossingguard contracts 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating results  including as a percentage of revenue  for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  restated lease service fees sales royalty revenue total revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses  excluding impairment charges impairment charge for long lived assets loss from operations loss gain on debt other income expense derivative instrument expense debt discount expense net loss analysis of the years ended december  and december  revenue during the year ended december   revenue increased  or  to  from  in the comparable period in the increase in overall revenue was primarily the result of a increase in lease and service fees offset by no product sales in lease and service fee revenues totaled  in  as compared with  in  an increase of  or  primarily due to additional revenue generating approaches 
for the year  our red light business began the year with revenue generating approaches and ended with revenue generating approaches 
during the year  we installed revenue generating approaches and did not decommission any 
in  we started the year with revenue generating approaches  installed revenue generating approaches  had installed approaches decommissioned and acquired approaches on august from transol usa 
the decommissioned approaches resulted from i on june  approaches in falls church and vienna  virginia were turned off due to the expiration of the enabling law in virginia  and ii the conclusion of a contract with one customer with approaches 
additionally  average monthly revenue generated from approaches installed in and before  decreased in as violation rates declined  which typically occurs due to modified driver behavior 
there were no direct product sales or product sales recognized from sales type leases for crossingguard roadside systems in as compared to  in the period 
prior year direct product sales were with one customer for  and product sales recognized from sales type leases were primarily attributable to twenty delaware approaches being completed and funded under sales type leasing during the year 
these product sales are unique and are one time  non recurring in nature 
residual royalty streams from two customers relating to technology licenses to ibm and ncs accounted for product royalty revenues of  and  in and  respectively 

table of contents cost of sales for the year ended december   cost of sales totaled  an increase of  or  compared to  in the increase in cost of sales is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized systems and associated direct processing and support costs for more revenue generating red light approaches and speed units 
the twelve months of also includes higher costs related to our transol contracts  which we acquired in september as well as indirect costs for our poliscan speed business which is not yet profitable 
these increases in costs are partially offset by the decline in product cost of sales as a result of no one time  nonrecurring sales in gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit declined  or  to  from  in  while gross margin decreased by four percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to a higher mix of lower margin sales type leases in versus  particularly related to our acquired transol contracts and initial investment in our speed business 
operating expenses total operating expenses amounted to  in  an increase of  or  over total operating expenses of  in the increase is primarily due to the recording of a  nonrecurring non cash impairment charge in the year relating to our long lived assets mostly associated with our transol contracts acquired in  and the adoption of fasr in by recording a  non cash stock compensation charge  offset by steps taken to reduce costs including the reduction in salaries to most employees by during the year including management under employment contract  and terminating nine employees in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the severance cost of these actions was  and is primarily included in operating expense during the year 
in march  the company took steps to reduce costs including the reduction in salaries to most employees by including management under employment contract  and terminated nine employees 
the severance cost of this action was  and primarily affected our operating expenses 
in november  we instituted additional operational cost reductions in an internal reorganization intended to focus the company s operations on program delivery and support and reduce current operating expense levels 
the reorganization resulted in the reduction of employees  or approximately of the workforce  which is expected to result in an annual payroll reduction of over million 
the cost savings of the actions taken in the fourth quarter of actions are not expected to begin to affect our financial results until the first quarter of engineering and operations expenses totaled  in the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  in excluding the  stock compensation charge recorded in  the increase in costs related to supporting our increased install base partially offset by the impact of the march cost reduction program 
research and development expenses totaled  in the year ended december   a decline of  compared with  in the comparable year of excluding the  stock compensation charge recorded in  research and development expenses declined  the transition of our red light technology from analog to digital as well as the commercialization of our mobile speed enforcement technology was substantially completed in resulting in a decline in r d costs in the latter half of the year 
we expect research and development costs to continue to decline in selling and marketing expenses totaled  in the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared with  in excluding the  stock compensation charge recorded in  sales and marketing costs were relatively flat with the prior year 

table of contents general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared with  in excluding the  stock compensation charge recorded in  general and administrative expenses declined slightly primarily due to the reduction in legal expenses associated with the conclusion of a patent infringement case in june we assess potential impairment of our long lived assets on an annual basis or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
our long lived assets are primarily capitalized systems  property and equipment  and our identifiable intangibles such as goodwill and customer contracts 
we determine such impairment by measuring the estimated undiscounted future cash flow generated by the assets  comparing the result to the asset carrying value and adjust the asset to the lower of its carrying value or fair value and charging current operations for the measured impairment 
the determination of the asset fair value is subject to significant judgment 
in the second quarter of  the company recorded a  impairment charge relating to two of our red light contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a  impairment charge primarily relating to long lived assets associated with underperforming contracts we acquired from transol  inc in these impairment charges had no impact on our operating covenants associated with our debt agreements 
derivative instrument income expense derivative instrument income for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to income of  for the year ended december  the changes were attributable to changes in the fair market value of embedded derivatives issued with our convertible debt 
the fair value of the derivatives will fluctuate based on our stock price at particular points in time  the debt conversion price  the volatility of our stock price over a period of time  changes in the value of the risk free interest rate  and the remaining time to maturity of the outstanding debt 
the major factors contributing to the change for the year ended was due to the decline in the fair market value of our derivative instrument liabilities relating to our convertible debt due to the passage of time and a decline in our stock price 
debt discount expense debt discount expense for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  the increase in year ending december  is primarily due to higher debt discounts associated with the sale of our senior secured convertible notes  and higher debt discounts on the extension of our senior convertible notes in may these debt discounts are established at the time a derivative is bifurcated from the host debt agreement at issuance and amortized over the life of the note 
loss on debt refinancing during december  the company retired a laurus convertible note issued in may in the face amount of  which resulted in a loss on retirement of  related to the write off of the discount applied to the note for the value of the warrants originally issued with the note 
the note was retired in conjunction with the issuance of a new  non convertible note to laurus with a face value of  other expense net other expense  net totaled  in the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared with other expense  net of  in the increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of interest expense on the new senior secured convertible notes 

table of contents net loss for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  or per share  an increase of  compared with a net loss of  or per share  in the increase in net loss was primarily due to the recording of a  nonrecurring non cash impairment charge in the year relating to our long lived assets mostly associated with our transol contracts acquired in  the adoption of fasr in by recording a  non cash stock compensation charge   higher debt discount amortization   higher other expense  primarily interest  offset by  of higher derivative instrument income in the year 
the increase in net loss per share was primarily due to the increase in our net loss discussed above  partially offset by the increase in outstanding shares 
during the year ended december   there were  basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared with  for the year ended analysis of the years ended december  and december  revenue during the year ended december   revenue increased  or  to  from  in the comparable period in the increase in overall revenue was primarily the result of an increase in lease and service fees and product sales 
lease and service fee revenues totaled  in  as compared with  in  an increase of  or  primarily due to additional revenue generating approaches 
for the year  we began the year with revenue generating approaches and ended with revenue generating approaches 
during the year we installed revenue generating approaches  had installed approaches decommissioned  and acquired approaches on august from transol usa 
the decommissioned approaches resulted from i on june  approaches in falls church and vienna  virginia were turned off due to the expiration of the enabling law in virginia  and ii the conclusion of a contract with one customer with approaches 
in  we started the year with revenue generating approaches  installed approaches  and ended the year with revenue generating approaches 
additionally  average monthly revenue generated from approaches installed in and before  decreased in as violation rates declined  which typically occurs due to modified driver behavior 
product sales recognized from sales type leases for crossingguard roadside systems  totaled  in the period  compared with  in the period  an increase of  or 
this primarily represents delivery of roadside systems in the year  compared to delivery of roadside systems in the year
