the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview prospect capital is a publicly traded mezzanine debt and private equity firm that provides investment capital to micro to middle market companies 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of companies in need of capital for acquisitions  divestitures  growth  development  project financing and recapitalization 
we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted proforma cash flows 
the total portfolio value of our investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the fiscal year  our net cost of investments increased by  or  as we invested in new investments  while two of our investments repaid their loans during the year 
for the fiscal year ended june   our net assets increased by  or 
the change in net assets is as a result of an increase of  of proceeds from the issuance of new shares of our stock and  from net operations  offset by  in dividend distributions to our shareholders 
out of the  from net operations  our investment income accounted for  and realized gain on investments of  reduced by  in unrealized depreciation of investments 
the decrease in unrealized value was mainly associated with write downs in our investments in advantage oilfield group  ltd 
advantage  esa environmental specialists  inc esa  genesis coal corporation genesis  unity virginia holdings llc unity  whymore coal company  inc whymore and worcester energy company  inc weco 
however  there were significant write ups in our investments in gas solutions holdings  inc gshi and nrg manufacturing  inc nrg 
we seek to be a long term investor with our investment companies 
as of june   we continue to pursue our investment strategy and of our net assets are invested in long term investments 
our disciplined approach of investment has allowed us to invest primarily in industries related to the industrial energy economy 
however  we continue to strategically focus our disciplined approach in other sectors of the economy to diversify our portfolio holdings 
this is further evidenced by the change of our corporate name 
some of the companies in which we invest have relatively short or no operating histories 
these companies are and will be subject to all of the business risk and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise  including the risk that these companies may not reach their investments objective or the value of our investments in them may decline substantially or fall to zero 
after a robust global debt market during the earlier part of  beginning in june  signs of strain emerged as fears of increasing defaults in the subprime mortgage lending market caused a broader loss of investor confidence beyond the subprime mortgage lending market and into the corporate leveraged loan and high yield debt markets 
collateralized loan obligations clos and hedge funds  in particular  have been a driving force in the excess liquidity that existed in the debt capital markets 
the loss of investor confidence in many of these highly leveraged investment vehicles has significantly constrained the market for new clo issuance 
consequently  since june  there has been a significant reduction in liquidity in the corporate debt capital markets and several transactions in the high yield and leveraged loan markets have recently been cancelled  postponed  or restructured 
the extra supply and meaningfully less demand has shifted the dynamics between buyers and sellers and caused several hundred billion dollars of corporate loans and bridge loan commitments to remain on the balance sheets of financial institutions and remain undistributed 
we believe that  as of today  this reduction in liquidity remains technically driven and has caused increased market volatility in the secondary prices of existing leveraged loans and high yield bonds  driving many leveraged loan and bond market quotes to below the primary market offer price without regard to underlying fundamental performance of many of these issuers 
the valuation of securities held within our portfolio has not been adversely affected by these events because we have not participated in the syndicated loan market to date to any meaningful extent 
if we were to enter into these markets  we would be able to lend money at higher rates of interest and would be able to purchase loans at greater discounts than prior to the occurrence of these events  in turn these events also could increase our cost of financing 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or  gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ 
the following are significant accounting policies consistently applied by prospect capital we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and they are consistently applied by us investments a security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis 
b valuation investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
short term investments which mature in days or less  such as united states treasury bills  are valued at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
the amortized cost method involves valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of the difference between the principal amount due at maturity and cost 
short term securities which mature in more than days are valued at current market quotations by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
investments in money market mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation 
it is expected that most of the investments in the company s portfolio will not have readily available market values 
debt and equity securities whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value  with the assistance of an independent valuation service  using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process which is under the direction of our board of directors 
the factors that may be taken into account in fairly valuing investments include  as relevant  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the sensitivity of the investments to fluctuations in interest rates  the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates  comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies and other relevant factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of these investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments  and any such differences could be material 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued a new pronouncement addressing fair value measurements  statement of financial accounting standards number  fair value measurements fas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
c realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
d interest income adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income 
e dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
f structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned  usually when paid 
structuring fees  excess deal deposits  net profits interests and overriding royalty interest are included in other income 
in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june   the audit committee met on august   and considered valuations from the independent valuation firm and from management having an aggregate range of  to  our portfolio had an annualized current yield of and across all our long term debt and certain equity investments as of june  and june   respectively 
this yield includes interest from all of our long term investments as well as dividends from gshi 
we expect the current yield to decline over time as we increase the size of the portfolio 
monetization of other equity positions that we hold is not included in this yield calculation 
in each of our portfolio companies  we hold equity positions  ranging from minority interests to majority stakes  which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns 
many of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns  preferred distributions  flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns  as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity  in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections

as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual owns more than or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
as of june   we held a controlling interest in advantage  gshi  genesis  nrg  r v industries  inc  whymore and weco

accordingly  marginal spot prices for coal have fallen  at times  below operating costs for many of the coal producers in that region  including whymore  genesis and unity 
however  whymore and genesis are selling coal under a utility contract at above current spot market prices 
these developments have continued the risks associated with these investments and the risks of loss of capital 
however  cost cutting and revenue enhancing efforts have intensified  which  together with recent warmer weather and market production cuts  may improve the pricing situation 
we are looking at opportunities to take advantage of the current depressed pricing environment through acquisitions at favorable prices 
with respect to unity  discussions have been underway between prospect capital  the second lien holder  the senior lender texas capital  whose exposure has been reduced to  and unity regarding liquidating the last remaining saleable property in the collateral package which consists of land  coal inventory  and the refuse area 
according to unity  the sale could yield up to prospect capital believes that unity principals would then have to pay off the remaining debt to texas capital  making prospect capital the senior most secured lender
