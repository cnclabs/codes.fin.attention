overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical products to better diagnose  treat and manage patients 
we have four therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials targeting conditions such as depression  alzheimer s disease  cardiovascular disease and obesity 
in addition  we have two imaging agents in various stages of clinical development 
our blood pool imaging agent  vasovist is approved for marketing in the european union  canada  iceland  norway  switzerland and australia  and is currently marketed in europe 
we also have collaborations with smithkline beecham corporation glaxosmithkline  amgen inc  cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  and bayer schering pharma ag  germany formerly known as schering ag 
the focus of our therapeutic drug discovery and development efforts is on the two classes of drug targets known as g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  and ion channels 
gpcrs and ion channels are classes of proteins embedded in the surface membrane of all cells and are responsible for mediating much of the biological signaling at the cellular level 
we believe that our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach addresses many of the inefficiencies associated with traditional gpcr and ion channel targeted drug discovery 
by integrating computer based  or in silico  technology with in house medicinal chemistry  we believe that we can rapidly identify and optimize highly selective drug candidates 
we focus on gpcr and ion channel drug targets whose role in disease has already been demonstrated in clinical trials or in preclinical studies 
in each of our four clinical stage therapeutic programs  we used our drug discovery technology and approach to optimize a lead compound into a clinical drug candidate in less than ten months  synthesizing fewer than compounds per program 
we moved each of these drug candidates into clinical trials in less than months from lead identification 
we believe our drug discovery technology and approach enables us to efficiently and cost effectively discover and develop gpcr and ion channel targeted drugs 
on august   we completed our acquisition of predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc pursuant to the terms of that certain agreement and plan of merger  dated as of april  as amended on july   by and among us  epix delaware  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and predix  as amended 
pursuant to the merger agreement  predix merged with and into epix delaware  inc and became a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
the merger with predix was primarily a stock transaction valued at approximately million  including the assumption of net debt at closing 
as part of the merger  we also assumed all outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of predix 
the purchase price includes a million milestone payment to the holders of predix stock  options and warrants payable in cash  stock or a combination of both 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  million of the milestone was paid in cash on october  the remaining million of the milestone payment will be paid primarily in shares of epix common stock on october   except to the extent that such shares would cause the former predix shareholders  warrant holders and option holders to receive more than of outstanding shares measured as of the closing date immediately after such milestone payment when combined with all shares of epix common stock issued in the merger and issuable upon exercise of all predix options and warrants that we assumed in the merger 
the portion of the million milestone that cannot be paid in shares will be paid in cash with interest accrued at a rate of 
in addition  in connection with the merger  we effected a for reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 

table of contents our product candidates through the application of our gpcr and ion channel drug discovery expertise  over the past four years we have created a pipeline of drug candidates designed to address diseases with significant unmet medical needs and commercial potential across a range of therapeutic areas 
in addition  we have two imaging agents in various stages of clinical development 
the following chart summarizes the status of our clinical drug development programs picture therapeutics prx for alzheimer s disease prx is a novel  highly selective  small molecule ht agonist that we are developing for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
prx is being developed to provide improved cognition and to slow alzheimer s disease progression 
we initiated a phase trial of prx in combination with an approved drug for alzheimer s disease the cholinesterase inhibitor aricept donepezil in patients with alzheimer s disease in the fourth quarter of this randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multiple ascending dose trial is expected to enroll approximately patients with mild alzheimer s disease 
the two primary endpoints of the trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of prx in patients with alzheimer s disease when dosed orally once daily for days alone and in combination with donepezil  and to assess the effect of prx on brain wave activity  as was performed in the phase b clinical trial 
secondary endpoints of the trial include assessing the effects of repeat doses of prx on a battery of standardized cognitive function tests  as well as evaluating the pharmacokinetic effect of prx on donepezil concentrations in patients with mild alzheimer s disease 
we completed a phase b clinical trial in alzheimer s disease patients with prx in september prx was well tolerated in this trial and also in two additional phase clinical trials in healthy adult and elderly volunteers 
in the day phase b clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease  treatment with prx resulted in changes in brain wave activity in these patients that are consistent with those seen in clinical trials with currently approved drugs for alzheimer s disease 
in several pre clinical animal models  prx enhanced cognition and exhibited trends towards reduced levels of beta amyloid  or a  a protein that is believed to be associated with alzheimer s disease progression 
in addition  in a pre clinical animal model of memory impairment  prx demonstrated synergistic activity when combined with two different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  which are approved by the fda for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
these results are based on pre clinical animal studies and a small 
table of contents number of patients in phase clinical trials and are not necessarily predictive of results in later stage clinical trials with larger and more diverse patient populations 
on december   we entered into a development and license agreement with smithkline beecham corporation  doing business as glaxosmithkline  and glaxo group limited to develop and commercialize medicines targeting four gpcrs for the treatment of a variety of diseases  including an option to license prx and other medicines arising from the four research programs 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  we granted glaxosmithkline an option to obtain exclusive  worldwide license rights to complete the development and to commercialize the product candidates initially developed under each of the four research programs 
prx for pulmonary hypertension prx is a novel  highly selective  small molecule inhibitor  or antagonist  of a specific gpcr known as htb 
we are developing prx for the treatment of two types of pulmonary hypertension pulmonary arterial hypertension  and pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
pulmonary hypertension or ph in general is a serious  often fatal cardiovascular disease characterized by elevation of pulmonary blood pressure and progressive thickening and narrowing of the blood vessels of the lungs  often leading to heart failure 
we initiated a phase trial of prx in pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd in august this randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial is expected to enroll approximately patients with ph associated with copd 
the primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the effect of prx compared to placebo on systolic pulmonary artery pressure in patients with ph associated with copd following two weeks of treatment 
the trial is also designed to assess the safety and tolerability of prx during the course of therapy 
this study has been amended to include an open label extension where up to ten subjects will receive prx and be followed for safety for up to four additional weeks 
we have completed three phase clinical trials of prx in healthy volunteers  including a phase b clinical trial in athletes conditioned to exercise at high altitudes 
results from the phase b trial showed that  compared with placebo  prx caused a statistically significant reduction in the increase in systolic pulmonary blood pressure observed during exercise in volunteers breathing low oxygen 
in the two earlier phase trials as well as the phase b trial  prx was well tolerated  with a half life of approximately hours  supporting once daily oral dosing 
to date  there have been no serious adverse events associated with treatment with prx prx for depression we are currently developing prx  a novel  highly selective  small molecule hta agonist for the treatment of depression 
in march  we initiated a phase b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of prx in patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder mdd who also have concurrent anxiety 
the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial is expected to enroll approximately adult patients with mdd and is designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with up to mg of prx twice daily for eight weeks as determined by change from baseline in the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs compared with placebo 
all patients randomized to the drug treatment will begin with mg prx twice daily  and increase the dose  if tolerated  to a maximum of mg twice daily within the first week 
changes in the hamilton anxiety score ham a  clinical global impressions improvement scale cgi i and clinical global severity of illness scale cgi s will also be measured 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a dose escalating study of prx in healthy volunteers where we explored doses up to mg  either as a single daily dose or as mg given twice per day for three weeks 
prx was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or discontinuations 
this study indicated that prx at doses up to mg per day may be well tolerated  and we anticipate utilizing doses up to this level in future clinical trials 
we plan to initiate a randomized  blinded phase clinical trial of prx in major depression in the first half of in september we completed a pivotal phase clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with prx results from this trial demonstrated that prx did not achieve a statistically 
table of contents significant improvement over placebo for the primary endpoint of efficacy with respect to generalized anxiety disorder at the dose tested mg once daily 
the trial was statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of prx compared to placebo as measured by the change from baseline in the hamilton rating scale for anxiety or ham a 
the ham a scale is the accepted standard for the evaluation of anti anxiety drug activity by the us food and drug administration or fda 
effects of prx on symptoms of depression  which was a secondary endpoint of the phase clinical trial  were assessed using the montgomery asberg depression rating scale or madrs  an fda recommended assessment for depression 
the data from this trial showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline with prx treatment compared to placebo in the madrs score  indicating that prx reduced symptoms of depression present in the patients in this trial 
in this phase trial  prx was well tolerated  and the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was very low with prx vs 
with placebo 
to date  there have been no serious adverse events associated with treatment in more than subjects who have received prx based on the phase trial results  we have discontinued clinical development of prx at a dose of mg once daily in generalized anxiety disorder 
we are currently focusing our development efforts for this drug candidate on depression 
the phase trial in moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder was a double blind  placebo controlled  multi center study with approximately patients 
while patients with co morbid depressive symptoms were allowed to enroll in this trial  patients with a primary diagnosis of major depression were not enrolled 
the trial included sites in the united states 
patients were randomized equally into one of two arms treatment with prx  or placebo 
the trial protocol was oral dosing with prx at mg once daily for the first three days  followed by mg once daily for the remainder of the study 
the primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of prx as measured by the change from baseline in the ham a scale compared to placebo after eight weeks  with additional evaluations of ham a at two  four and six weeks 
the trial was statistically powered to detect an approximately two point difference in the change from baseline in ham a score with prx treatment vs 
placebo 
patients were not permitted to take any other psychiatric medications during the trial 
the preliminary phase trial data indicate the mean ham a score change from baseline to week eight with prx treatment was  compared to a mean ham a score change of from baseline to week eight with placebo 
this result corresponds to a measure of probability  or p value  of p  which is not statistically significant 
a p value represents the probability that a difference observed between groups during an experiment happened by chance 
for example  a p value of p means there is a probability that the result occurred by chance 
in general  clinical scientists regard p values of less than to be statistically significant  and p values greater than to be insignificant 
on the pre specified secondary endpoint of change in madrs  an index of depressive symptoms  there was a highly statistically significant p change from baseline to week eight with prx treatment compared to placebo 
there was also a trend toward improvement in symptoms of depression by week four  but this result did not reach statistical significance p 
other assessments of drug activity on anxiety and depression hospital anxiety and depression scale hads and profile of mood states scale poms also showed positive trends in efficacy  with hads data showing more effect on symptoms of depression than on anxiety  these effects were not statistically significant  however 
patients in the trial with high madrs scores at baseline upper half had a statistically significant improvement on symptoms of depression  as demonstrated by a mean madrs reduction of with prx treatment at week compared to a mean madrs reduction of with placebo p 
while these data are preliminary and continue to be analyzed  we believe that the data from this trial are encouraging regarding the potential efficacy of prx for the treatment of major depression 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a dose escalating study in healthy volunteers where we explored doses up to mg  either as a single daily dose or as mg given twice per day for three weeks 
the drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or discontinuations 
this study indicated that prx at doses up to mg per day may be well tolerated  and the company anticipates utilizing doses up to this level in future clinical trials 

table of contents prx for obesity  alzheimer s disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia prx is a novel  highly selective  small molecule antagonist of a specific gpcr known as ht prx is being developed for the treatment of obesity  alzheimer s disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia 
in october  we initiated a phase multiple ascending dose clinical trial to study the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of prx administered once daily for days in a population of otherwise healthy obese adults with body mass indices  or bmi  between and kg m normal bmi is less than kg m preliminary safety and tolerability data from a single ascending dose phase trial completed in healthy adult male and female volunteers indicated that single doses of prx were well tolerated up to mg  the highest dose tested 
in addition  prx demonstrated adequate absorption  with drug exposures increasing with increasing doses and a half life of to hours  which we believe may make prx suitable for once daily oral dosing 
pre clinical animal models of obesity suggest that this drug candidate may reduce both food intake and body weight 
in addition  pre clinical animal models of memory impairment suggest that prx may have cognitive enhancing properties 
imaging agents vasovist vasovist is an internally discovered  injectable intravascular contrast agent that is designed to provide improved imaging of the vascular system using magnetic resonance angiography or mra 
our target indication for vasovist is for use in mra imaging of peripheral vascular disease  with a goal of improving the physician s ability to visualize the human vascular system and thereby enhance disease diagnosis and treatment 
vasovist reversibly binds to the human blood protein albumin  allowing imaging of the blood vessels for approximately an hour after administration 
with a single injection  vasovist enables the capture of three dimensional images of arteries and veins in the body 
vasovist may make it possible for physicians to detect vascular disease earlier  more safely and less invasively than with x ray angiography  and for physicians to provide an improved evaluation of potential therapeutic options including percutaneous intervention and vascular surgery 
in october  the european medicines agency granted marketing approval of vasovist for all member states of the european union 
bayer schering pharma ag  germany  our strategic partner for vasovist  began marketing vasovist in europe in the second quarter of vasovist is currently marketed in the netherlands  norway  sweden  denmark  united kingdom  austria and germany 
in  vasovist was also approved for marketing in switzerland  australia  iceland  norway and  most recently  canada in december  we submitted a new drug application or nda to the fda for the use of vasovist in detection of vascular disease 
in january  we received an approvable letter from the fda for vasovist pending additional clinical trials 
in may  we submitted a response to the fda  which was accepted as a complete response the following month 
we received a second approvable letter from the fda in november we met with the fda twice in early to discuss the approvable letters and the path forward for vasovist in the united states 
after considering the parameters of the additional clinical trials requested by the fda  we filed a formal appeal with the fda requesting approval of vasovist  as well as the use of an advisory committee as part of the appeal process 
in august  we received a letter from the fda denying our formal appeal to approve vasovist and our request for an advisory committee to review vasovist 
in its response letter  the office of new drugs of the fda also suggested that if we decide to conduct additional clinical research to support approval  then rather than relying on a blinded re read of previously submitted data and data from a new clinical trial  a safer course of action would be to conduct two new clinical trials to support the application for approval 
we have met with the fda after receiving the august response letter and in february we filed a second formal appeal with the fda requesting approval of vasovist  as well as the use of an advisory committee as part of the appeal process 
the fda informed us that the response to our appeal regarding vasovist will extend beyond the originally anticipated day period 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding the appeals process 
we cannot assure you that the appeal process will 
table of contents be successful either in whole or in part  or that we will be able to reach agreement with the fda on an acceptable path forward for any approval of vasovist in the united states 
ep r we have developed a second targeted contrast agent product candidate  ep r  which is designed to enable the identification of blood clots using mri 
finding blood clots is of critical medical significance in the evaluation and diagnosis of patients with possible stroke  transient ischemic attack  chest pain  heart attack  irregular heartbeat  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism 
we designed ep r to bind reversibly to fibrin  the dominant protein found in blood clots 
epr entered a phase clinical trial in april  which was subsequently amended to include additional patient safety monitoring based on a review by the fda of observations from a day  repeat dose pre clinical toxicology study 
we completed this phase a clinical trial of ep r in the second quarter of in this study  we saw encouraging images  which may be indicative of ep r s potential utility for identifying patients at risk of acute thrombotic events  such as stroke and transient ischemic attack 
the data from the phase a clinical trial was presented at the annual meeting of the radiological society of north america in november in the study  ep r was able to detect blood clots not previously seen on mri and enhanced the images of clots previously seen on mri 
results also showed that ep r was well tolerated and able to detect or enhance clots on mri images in all six of the body systems studied pulmonary  deep vein  carotid artery  cardiac atria  left ventricle  thoracic aorta 
in  we completed phase clinical trials of ep r in which it was well tolerated in healthy volunteers 
in pre clinical studies  ep r has been shown to enhance the ability of mri to image clots throughout the vascular system 
we granted bayer schering pharma  ag germany an option to license and develop ep r  which  in  it determined not to exercise 
we do not intend to conduct additional clinical studies on ep r utilizing internal resources and  accordingly  we are pursuing a partner for the continued development of ep r 
our therapeutic drug discovery technology and approach we have developed a novel and proprietary in silico protein structure based approach to gpcr and ion channel targeted drug discovery that allows us to benefit from the structure based approach in the absence of experimentally determined structures for these targets 
our predict technology combines genomic information the amino acid sequence of the target protein with physical and chemical properties of the cell membrane environment to determine the most stable d structure of a membrane bound protein 
the use of our predict technology to determine a d structure of the target protein is the foundation and first step in our novel system of discovery and optimization for gpcr and ion channel targeted drugs 
we maintain our gpcr and ion channel structures as trade secrets  which  when combined with our proprietary software and the know how required to use the predict technology  we believe creates a strong barrier to entry for our competitors 
using our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach requires the successive application of the following five steps using our predict technology to identify the most stable d structure of the desired gpcr or ion channel drug target  bypassing the need for x ray crystallography  analyzing the resulting d structure and identifying a potential binding site on the target structure for drug interaction  performing in silico screening using the computer to virtually fit more than two million drug like compounds into this drug site  ensuring that both the shape and chemical properties of the binding site and the compound match  selecting the approximately compounds that best match the binding site on the target and testing their activity in vitro in the laboratory and identifying the most active and novel chemical compounds  referred to as lead compounds  and then subjecting these lead compounds to an integrated structure based lead optimization process 
the predict generated d structure of the target protein as well as other d protein structures many of which are also generated by predict and more traditional medicinal chemistry efforts 
table of contents are used to steer lead optimization along the most efficient path  transforming lead compounds into drug candidates expeditiously 
our discovery and optimization process is outlined in the following steps predict d in silico modeling 
we have developed novel proprietary algorithms which we use in our predict technology to model the d structure of targets of interest gpcrs and ion channel proteins from their primary amino acid sequence 
predict uses algorithms that explore a large number of possible structures of the target and then selects the biologically relevant one 
it takes into account specific interactions between the target protein and the membrane  specific interactions within the target protein itself  and addresses the limitations that hamper homology based modeling of gpcrs and ion channel proteins 
the predict software code and many of its algorithms are kept as trade secrets  making it difficult to copy or reverse engineer 
we filed patent applications for predict version in the current version of predict has evolved considerably from the original version and includes numerous new algorithms and capabilities 
predict bypasses the need for x ray crystallography structures of the gpcr or ion channel protein target to initiate a structure based so called rational drug discovery program 
virtual libraries 
our libraries consist of in silico versions of approximately four million drug like compounds which are available for purchase from commercial vendors worldwide 
these virtual libraries reduce the need for us to synthesize or purchase  store and maintain tens or hundreds of thousands of actual compounds for the initial screening 
rapid in silico screening 
the process of in silico screening requires the computer to perform trillions of operations in trying to fit numerous drug like compounds into the binding site of the target protein  matching both shape and chemical properties 
we perform high throughput in silico screening with a combination of proprietary and commercially available public software to identify compounds that may bind to a target gpcr or ion channel protein 
ranking of screening results 
we have developed proprietary algorithms for ranking our in silico screening results using internally developed tools  which we believe enables us to select the most promising compounds for in vitro testing 
integrated structure based lead optimization 
the most promising novel lead compounds  identified in silico and shown to have binding affinity and functionality in vitro  are optimized into drug candidates using an integrated structure based approach 
this process makes use of the predict d structures of the drug target and related off target proteins as well as many other in silico tools that we have created to enable efficient structure based lead optimization  leading to highly selective drug candidates 
these tools allow us to overcome challenges frequently encountered during lead optimization  such as selectivity  blood brain barrier penetration and herg ion channel binding  in a fraction of the time and cost compared to traditional lead optimization efforts 
using these in silico tools  our computational and medicinal chemists are able to select for actual synthesis the most promising subset of suggested compounds for further optimization 
in each of our clinical stage programs  this approach has allowed us to synthesize fewer than of the compounds that we believe would have been synthesized if we were to follow the traditional methods of lead optimization 
strategic alliances and collaborations glaxosmithkline on december   we entered into a development and license agreement with smithkline beecham corporation  doing business as glaxosmithkline  and glaxo group limited to develop and commercialize medicines targeting four g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  for the treatment of a variety of diseases  including an option to license our ht partial agonist  prx  and other medicines arising from the four research programs

the parties each have the right to terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or commits an uncured material breach of the collaboration agreement 
in addition  glaxosmithkline has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety  and to terminate its rights to any program developed under the collaboration agreement on a regional or worldwide basis  in each case without cause 
upon a termination of the collaboration agreement  depending upon the circumstances  the parties have varying rights and obligations with respect to the grant of continuing license rights  continued commercialization rights and continuing royalty obligations 
amgen on july   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with amgen inc to develop and commercialize products based on our pre clinical compounds that modulate the sp receptor and compounds and products that may be identified by or acquired by amgen and that modulate the sp receptor 
the sp receptor is a cell surface gpcr found on white blood cells and in other tissues that is associated with certain autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 
pursuant to the license agreement  we granted amgen an exclusive worldwide license to our intellectual property and know how related to the compounds in our sp program that modulate the sp receptor  for

cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated in march  we entered into a research  development and commercialization agreement with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  or cfft  the drug discovery and development affiliate of the cystic fibrosis foundation 
in august  we expanded the research  development and commercialization agreement with cfft 
through december  we have received approximately million from cfft under this agreement  consisting of a million upfront payment  approximately million of reimbursed research and development costs and milestone payments totaling approximately million 
the milestone payments  which were earned in july and august  relate to the first development program described 
table of contents below 
including the payments already received  we may be eligible for up to an aggregate of million from cfft under this agreement 
the agreement involves two development programs as follows the first program is focused on correcting a malfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  or cftr  ion channel protein 
we are using our proprietary structure based technologies to model the structure of this ion channel protein target and identify binding sites in the channel for therapeutic intervention 
once these sites are identified  we aim to use our drug discovery capabilities to discover a drug that restores proper functionality to the channel in patients with cystic fibrosis 
if the preliminary program is successful  we and cfft have agreed to negotiate towards a follow on agreement under which we will explore a structure based approach for the discovery and commercialization of a drug that will target cftr  with the financial support of cfft and subject to a royalty payable to cfft 
the second program is focused on the discovery of a small molecule agonist to the g protein coupled receptor known as py  which plays a role in cystic fibrosis  using our proprietary structure based drug design system 
we retain the right to develop and commercialize any drug candidates discovered through this second program  and are obligated to make aggregate royalty payments of up to million to cfft for the first drug candidate that reaches particular regulatory and sales milestones 
the agreement expires with respect to the first program on august  and with respect to the second program on march   unless extended by the parties or terminated by either party beforehand 
the second program has been extended through december  cfft may terminate either or both programs without cause upon days notice or if we suspend or discontinue our business 
either party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach 
technology agreements tyco in august  we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with mallinckrodt inc subsequently acquired by tyco international ltd  involving research  development and marketing of mri vascular contrast agents developed or in licensed by either party 
in june  in connection with the exclusive license that we granted to bayer schering pharma ag  germany under our strategic collaboration agreement  we amended our strategic collaboration with tyco 
the amendment enabled us to sublicense certain technology from tyco to bayer schering pharma ag  germany which allowed us to enter into the strategic collaboration agreement for vasovist with bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
pursuant to that amendment  we also granted to tyco a non exclusive  worldwide license to manufacture vasovist for clinical development and commercial use on behalf of bayer schering pharma ag  germany in accordance with a manufacturing agreement entered into in june between tyco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
in connection with this amendment  we paid tyco an up front fee of million and are obligated to pay up to an additional million in milestone payments  of which million was paid following nda filing in february and million will be paid upon us product approval 
we will also pay tyco a share of our vasovist operating profit margins in the united states and a percentage of the royalty that we receive from bayer schering pharma ag  germany on vasovist gross profits outside the united states 
bracco in september  pursuant to a settlement and release agreement and worldwide license agreement  we granted bracco a worldwide  non exclusive royalty bearing sub license to certain of our patents 
under the terms of the license fee  we received million in and are entitled to receive royalty payments from bracco on their sales of multihance 
the royalty on sales of multihance expires on the patent expiration date in each country in which multihance is sold 
we expect to receive our final royalty payment in the first quarter of 
table of contents competition we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding  both in the united states and abroad 
some of these competitors are pursuing the development of product candidates that target the same indications that we are targeting for our clinical and pre clinical programs 
even if we and our collaborators are successful in developing our clinical stage candidates  the resulting products will compete with a variety of established products 
significant competitors in the area of gpcr focused drug discovery include arena pharmaceuticals  acadia pharmaceuticals and tm pharma  and for ion channels our competitors include vertex pharmaceuticals and sucampo pharmaceuticals 
in addition  most large pharmaceutical companies have drug discovery programs that target gpcrs and ion channels 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and product development experience and resources than we do 
these companies also have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do  and have significantly greater experience than we do in preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products  and in obtaining fda and other regulatory clearances 
our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer  more effective  have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop 
if our clinical stage drug candidates are approved  they will compete with currently approved drugs and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications  including the following prx if approved  prx  the drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as actelion pharmaceuticals ltd  glaxosmithkline plc  pfizer inc and united therapeutics corporation  and may compete with drug candidates in clinical development by other companies  such as encysive pharmaceuticals inc and gilead sciences  inc 
prx if approved  prx  the drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of depression  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  pfizer inc 
and wyeth  and may compete with drug candidates in clinical development from other companies  including sanofi aventis  neurocrine and glaxosmithkline plc licensed from fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc prx if approved  prx  the drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  inc  johnson johnson  novartis ag and pfizer  inc  and may compete with drug candidates in clinical development from other companies  including myriad genetics  inc and neurochem inc 
we are developing prx in combination with approved products  particularly aricept which is marketed by pfizer inc prx if approved for the treatment of obesity  alzheimer s disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia  prx will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as abbott laboratories and roche holding ltd  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development by other companies  such as sanofi aventis and arena pharmaceuticals  inc if approved for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with alzheimer s disease or schizophrenia  prx will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  johnson johnson  novartis ag and pfizer  inc  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development from other companies  including glaxosmithkline plc and saegis pharmaceuticals  inc vasovist and ep r 
there are a number of general use mri agents approved for marketing in the united states and in certain foreign markets that  if used or developed for mr angiography  are likely to compete with vasovist 
such products include magnevist and gadovist by bayer schering pharma 
table of contents ag  germany  dotarem by guerbet  sa  omniscan by ge healthcare  prohance and multihance by bracco and optimark by tyco international ltd 
we are aware of five agents under clinical development that have been or are being evaluated for use in mra bayer schering pharma ag  germany s gadomer and shuc  guerbet  sa s vistarem  bracco s b  ferropharm gmbh s code vsop c  and advanced magnetics  inc s ferumoxytol 
we are not currently aware of any mri contrast agent other than ep r being developed for use in imaging blood clots 
in addition to competition within the mri field  we also face competition from other imaging technologies  including ct scans  ultrasounds  and x ray scans 
our success will depend on physician acceptance of mri as a primary imaging modality for certain vascular and other applications 
intellectual property we actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business  including chemical species  compositions and formulations  their methods of use and processes for their manufacture  as new intellectual property is developed 
in addition to seeking patent protection in the united states  we plan to selectively file patent applications in certain additional foreign countries in order to further protect the inventions that we consider important to the development of our foreign business 
we also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information 
as of march   our patent portfolio included a total of issued us patents  issued foreign patents  two allowed us patent awaiting issuance and pending patent applications in the united states and other countries with claims covering the composition of matter and methods of use for all of our clinical stage candidates 
in addition to patents  we rely where necessary upon unpatented trade secrets and know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we seek to protect our proprietary information  in part  using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our collaborators  employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
in addition  we license  and expect to continue to license  third party technologies and other intellectual property rights that are incorporated into some elements of our drug discovery and development efforts 
set forth below are our significant license agreements 
ramot our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach is in part embodied in technology that we license from ramot at tel aviv university ltd  the technology transfer company of tel aviv university 
pursuant to this license  we have exclusive  worldwide rights to certain technology developed at tel aviv university to develop  commercialize and sell products for the treatment of diseases or conditions in humans and animals 
the licensed technology  as continually modified  added to and enhanced by us  consists in large part of computer based models of biological receptors and methods of designing drugs to bind to those receptors 
all of our current clinical stage therapeutic drug candidates  prx  prx  prx and prx  were  at least in part  identified  characterized or developed using the licensed technology  and we would be required to make payments to ramot  as described below  as and when rights to any such drug candidates are ever sublicensed or any such drug candidates are commercialized 
in addition  we have used the licensed technology in all of our preclinical stage programs and would expect to make payments to ramot if rights to any drug candidates were ever commercialized from any of these programs 
one of our former employees and a current employee  oren becker  former chief scientific officer  and sharon shacham  vice president of product leadership  respectively were inventors of the technology that we license from ramot 
we believe that ramot shares a portion of any royalty income received with the respective inventors and  accordingly  dr 
becker and dr 
shacham receive a portion of the amounts we pay ramot 

table of contents we paid ramot an upfront fee of  upon the grant of the license 
under the license  we have an obligation to make royalty payments to ramot on our net sales of products that are identified  characterized or developed through the use of the licensed technology that are either or of such net sales depending upon the degree to which the product needed to be modified after being identified  characterized or developed through the use of the licensed technology and decrease as the volume of sales increases 
the royalty obligation for each product expires on a country by country basis twelve years after the first commercial sale 
there is also an annual minimum royalty payment obligation of  per year 
we also are required to share between and of the consideration we receive from parties to whom we grant sublicenses of rights in the ramot technology or sublicenses of rights in products identified  characterized or developed with the use of such technology and between and of consideration we receive from performing services using such technology 
in connection with our collaborations with glaxosmithkline  amgen and cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  we have to date paid  in total royalties to ramot primarily for the total payments received to date for the upfront payments and milestone payments received to date under these license agreements 
the license may be terminated by either party upon a material breach by the other party unless cured within days  in the case of a payment breach  and days in the case of any other breach 
the license may also be terminated by either party in connection with the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party 
the license expires upon the expiration of our obligation to make payments to ramot 
therefore  since we have an ongoing obligation to pay annual minimum royalties to ramot as described above  the license may not expire and may only terminate upon a breach by  or bankruptcy of  a party 
massachusetts general hospital in july  we entered into a license agreement with massachusetts general hospital mgh pursuant to which mgh granted us an exclusive worldwide license to patents and patent applications which relate to vasovist 
the mgh license imposed certain due diligence obligations with respect to the development of products covered by the license  all of which have been fulfilled to date 
the mgh license requires us to pay royalties on the net sales of products covered by this license  including primovist  multihance and vasovist 
we have paid mgh approximately  in royalty payments  primarily related to the sale of primovist and multihance  through under this license agreement 
the license agreement expires on a country by country basis when the patents covered by the license agreement expire 
the majority of the patents covered by this license agreement expired in november the license agreement does not contain a renewal provision 
we believe that the expiration of these patents does not compromise our proprietary position with respect to vasovist because vasovist is covered by composition of matter patents independent of our license with mgh 
these composition of matter patents extend into in the united states  although the life of these patents may be extended 
prince in november  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with dr 
martin r 
prince  an early innovator in the field of magnetic resonance angiography relating to dynamic magnetic resonance angiography  which involves capturing magnetic resonance angiography images during the limited time  typically to seconds  available for imaging with extracellular agents 
under the terms of the intellectual property agreement  dr 
prince granted us certain discharges  licenses and releases in connection with the historic and future use of vasovist by us and agreed not to sue us for intellectual property infringement related to the use of vasovist 
in consideration of dr 
prince entering into the agreement  we agreed to pay him an upfront fee of  and royalties on sales of vasovist consistent with a non exclusive early stage academic license and delivered to him  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately million based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the agreement 
in addition  we agreed to supply dr 
prince with approximately  worth of vasovist per year during the term of the agreement 
the agreement expires upon the expiration of the last patent under the agreement 
the agreement is subject to termination by either party upon the incurred material branch of the agreement by the other party 
as of december  no vasovist product has been requested by or provided to dr 
prince 

table of contents marketing  sales and distribution we currently have no marketing  sales or distribution capabilities 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates or imaging products  we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties 
in selected indications where we believe that our products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited but focused group of physicians  we may commercialize our products in the united states 
for example  we believe that pulmonary specialists who treat pulmonary hypertension  and the centers in which they practice  are sufficiently concentrated to enable us to effectively promote prx  if approved by the fda  to this market in the united states with a small internal sales force 
in therapeutic or diagnostic areas that require a large sales force selling to a large and diverse prescribing population and for markets outside of the united states  we plan to establish collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for commercialization of our drug candidates 
with respect to vasovist  we have granted bayer schering pharma ag  germany an exclusive license to co develop and market vasovist worldwide under our strategic collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
with respect to prx  we have granted glaxosmithkline an exclusive option to obtain exclusive  worldwide license rights to complete the development and commercialize prx with respect to our preclinical compounds that modulate the sp receptor  we have granted amgen an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of those compounds 
manufacturing we outsource and plan to continue to outsource manufacturing responsibilities to third parties for our existing and future drug candidates for clinical development and commercial purposes 
we are currently working with our contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product in each of our programs for our planned clinical trials in if one of our manufacturers for our therapeutic product candidates should become unavailable to it for any reason  we believe that there are a number of potential replacements as our processes are not manufacturer specific  though we may incur some added cost and delay in identifying or qualifying such replacements  including delays associated with the need for fda review and approval of the new manufacturer  as well as those associated with the new manufacturer s ability to establish the manufacturing process 
bayer schering pharma ag  germany is responsible for the manufacture of vasovist 
bayer schering pharma ag  germany relies on tyco as the sole manufacturer of vasovist for human clinical trials and commercial use 
together with bayer schering pharma ag  germany  epix is considering alternative manufacturing arrangements for vasovist for commercial use  including the potential transfer of manufacturing to bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
in the event that tyco fails to fulfill its manufacturing responsibilities satisfactorily  bayer schering pharma ag  germany has the right to purchase vasovist from a third party or to manufacture the compound itself 
we currently rely on aptuit  inc and metrics  inc 
for our therapeutic drug product manufacturing and testing  and on evotec  ltd 
and johnson matthey pharma services for the manufacture and testing of our active therapeutic pharmaceutical ingredients 
our agreements with these suppliers generally operate on a work order basis  with no minimum purchase requirements and are generally terminable by us upon days and days prior written notice  respectively 
small amounts of material used for pre clinical research and development purposes are synthesized in house 
the production of our drug candidates prx  prx  prx and prx uses small molecule synthetic organic chemistry procedures that are standard in the pharmaceutical industry 
there are no complicated chemistries or unusual equipment required in the manufacturing process of these drug candidates 
prx  prx  prx and prx are all currently administered as unformulated drug products 
a commercially viable formulation will need to be developed  manufactured and certified for each of these drug candidates 
the final commercial formulation may not prove to be bioequivalent to the current formulation 
this may result in the need to initiate additional clinical trials to define new dosing regimes 
furthermore  the development and implementation of a new formulation and commercial process for cgmp manufacturing may add significant delays to additional clinical trials  regulatory filings and commercial launch 

table of contents government regulation and product approval the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of our products 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other actions that could affect our product candidates or us 
any failure to comply with regulatory requirements  to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
the process required by the fda before drugs may be marketed in the united states 
generally involves the following preclinical laboratory and animal studies  submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  and fda approval of a new drug application  or nda 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage 
during preclinical studies  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of the drug candidate in animals  both healthy and with the targeted disease 
also  preclinical tests evaluate the safety of drug candidates 
preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations 
in some cases  long term preclinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing 
prior to commencing a clinical trial  we must submit an ind to the fda 
the ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
our submission of an ind may not result in fda authorization to commence a clinical trial 
all clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice regulations 
these regulations include the requirement that all subjects provide informed consent 
further  an institutional review board  or irb  at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap phase the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the disease and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
these studies are intended to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the product and provide  if appropriate  an adequate basis for product labeling 

table of contents in the case of some products for severe or life threatening diseases  especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers  the initial human testing is often conducted in patients 
because these patients already have the target disease  these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in phase clinical trials  and thus these trials are frequently referred to as phase clinical trials 
the fda or an irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
concurrent with clinical trials and preclinical studies  companies also must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cgmp requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality  purity and potency of the final drugs 
additionally  appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life 
a sponsor of an ind may request that the fda evaluate within days certain protocols and issues relating to the protocols 
such special protocol assessments  or spas  may be requested for clinical protocols for phase clinical trials whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim if the trials had been the subject of discussion at an end of phase pre phase meeting 
if the sponsor and the fda reach a written agreement regarding the protocol  the spas will be considered binding on the fda and will not be changed unless the sponsor fails to follow the agreed upon protocol  data supporting the request are found to be false or incomplete  or the fda determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began 
even if a spa is agreed to  approval of the nda is not guaranteed since a final determination that an agreed upon protocol satisfies a specific objective  such as the demonstration of efficacy  or supports an approval decision  will be based on a complete review of all the data in the nda 
the results of product development  preclinical studies and clinical studies  along with descriptions of the manufacturing process  analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug  results of chemical studies and other relevant information are submitted to the fda as part of an nda requesting approval to market the product 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
it may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
in this event  the nda must be resubmitted with the additional information 
the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the fda accepts it for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
the submission of an nda is subject to the payment of user fees  but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain circumstances 
the fda may refuse to approve an nda if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data 
even if such data is submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
the fda has various programs  including fast track  priority review and accelerated approval that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints 
generally  drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions  those with the potential to address unmet medical needs  and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments 
for example  priority review applies to new drugs that have the potential for providing significant improvements compared to marketed products in the treatment or prevention of a disease 
although priority review does not affect the standards for approval  fda will attempt to expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review 
we do not know whether our drugs will be eligible for  or whether we will apply for  any of these programs 
even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs  we cannot be sure that the time period for fda review will be shortened 

table of contents satisfaction of fda requirements or similar requirements of state  local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes at least several years and the actual time required may vary substantially  based upon  among other things  the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
even if a product receives regulatory approval  the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
delays in obtaining  or failures to obtain regulatory approvals for any drug candidate could substantially harm our business and cause our stock price to drop significantly 
in addition  we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future us or foreign governmental action 
any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including  among other things  record keeping requirements  reporting of adverse experiences with the drug  drug sampling and distribution requirements  notifying the fda and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes  complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with fda promotion and advertising requirements 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the pharmaceutical cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation  which might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the us or abroad 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the us orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
orphan drug exclusivity  however  also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the fda or if our product is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease 
we intend to file for orphan drug designation for those diseases that meet the criteria for orphan designation  including for prx for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension 
there is no guarantee that we will be awarded orphan exclusivity for prx or for any other products or indications 
in addition  obtaining fda approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may not provide us with a material commercial advantage 
the fda modernization act of included a pediatric exclusivity provision that was extended by the best pharmaceuticals for children act of pediatric exclusivity is designed to provide an incentive to manufacturers for conducting research about the safety of their products in children 
pediatric exclusivity  if granted  provides an additional six months of market exclusivity in the us for new or currently marketed drugs 
under section a of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  six months of market exclusivity may be granted in exchange for the voluntary completion of pediatric studies in accordance with an fda issued written request 
the fda may issue a written request for studies on 
table of contents unapproved or approved indications  where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population  or part of the pediatric population  may produce health benefits in that population 
we have not requested or received a written request for such pediatric studies  although we may ask the fda to issue a written request for such studies in the future 
to receive the six month pediatric market exclusivity  we would have to receive a written request from the fda  conduct the requested studies and submit reports of the studies in accordance with a written agreement with the fda or  if there is no written agreement  in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles 
there is no guarantee that the fda will issue a written request for such studies or accept the reports of the studies 
the current pediatric exclusivity provision is scheduled to end on october  and it may not be reauthorized 
reimbursement sales of our product candidates depend in significant part on the availability of third party reimbursement 
we anticipate third party payors will provide reimbursement for our therapeutic and imaging products 
it is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third party payors 
reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of  or the mma  imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries  which may affect the marketing of our products 
the mma also introduced a new reimbursement methodology  part of which went into effect in at this point  it is not clear what effect the mma will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for new drugs approved after january  moreover  while the mma applies only to drug benefits for medicare beneficiaries  private payors often follow medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates 
any reduction in payment that results from the mma may result in a similar reduction in payments from non governmental payors 
in addition  in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
employees we believe that our success will depend greatly on our ability to identify  attract and retain capable employees 
as of december   we had fulltime employees  including a total of employees who hold md or md degrees 
of our employees  of our employees are primarily engaged in research and development activities  and are primarily engaged in general and administrative activities 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we believe our relations with our employees are good 
research and development during the years ended december    and we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million respectively 
included in our research and development expense is a nonrecurring charge of million for the acquisition of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of predix 
the in process research and development charge represents the fair value of purchased in process technology of predix for research projects that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
risks related to our business a substantial portion of our future revenues will be dependent upon our agreements with glaxosmithkline  amgen inc and bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
we expect that a substantial portion of our future revenues will be dependent upon our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and with amgen inc the agreement with glaxosmithkline encompasses the development and commercialization of medicines targeting four g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  for the treatment of a variety of diseases  including an option to license our ht partial agonist  prx  and other medicines arising from the four research programs 
the agreement with amgen encompasses the development and commercialization of products based on our pre clinical compounds that modulate the sp receptor and compounds and products that may be identified by or acquired by amgen and that modulate the sp receptor 
we are substantially dependent upon bayer schering pharma ag  germany to commercialize vasovist  our lead imaging product candidate  in the united states and europe 
if these collaborators were to terminate their agreements with us  fail to meet their obligations or otherwise decrease their commitment there under  our future revenues could be materially adversely affected and the development and commercialization of our product candidates would be interrupted 
in addition  if we do not achieve some or any of the development  regulatory and commercial milestones or if glaxosmithkline or amgen does not achieve certain net sales thresholds  in each case  as set forth in the respective agreements  we will not fully realize the expected benefits of the agreements 
further  the achievement of certain of the various milestones under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline  amgen and bayer schering pharma ag  germany will depend on factors that are outside of our control and most are not expected for several years  if at all 
moreover  our receipt of revenues under our agreements with these collaborators will be directly affected by the level of efforts of such collaborators and we cannot control whether they will devote sufficient resources to development or commercialization of the technology under their respective agreement or whether they will elect to pursue the development or commercialization of alternative products or services 
for instance  bayer schering pharma ag  germany currently markets imaging agents for other technologies that will compete against vasovist  and bayer schering pharma ag  germany will be responsible for setting the price of the product candidate worldwide 
accordingly  bayer schering pharma ag  germany may not set prices in a manner that maximizes revenues for us 
disagreements with our collaborators could delay or terminate the continued development and commercialization of the licensed products under our agreements or result in litigation  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations overall 
in addition  bayer schering pharma was recently formed through the merger of bayer ag and schering ag 
if the strategy of bayer schering pharma ag  germany after the merger differs from 
table of contents that of schering ag s prior strategy with respect to the marketing of vasovist  our expectations regarding the marketing of vasovist could be negatively impacted  which could have a material adverse effect on our imaging business 
if any of our agreements with glaxosmithkline  amgen or bayer schering pharma ag  germany is terminated prior to expiration  we would be required to enter into other strategic relationships or find alternative ways of continuing our product development programs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into similar agreements with other companies with sufficient product development capabilities to commercialize our product candidates  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
we anticipate future losses and may never become profitable 
our future financial results are uncertain 
we have experienced significant losses since we commenced operations in our accumulated net losses as of december  were approximately million 
these losses have primarily resulted from expenses associated with our research and development activities  including pre clinical studies and clinical trials  acquired in process research and development from the merger with predix and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will remain significant in the future and we expect to incur losses over at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts  pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
in particular  we believe that we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain approval from the fda for any of our product candidates  including vasovist which trials would be expensive and which could contribute to our continuing to incur losses 
in addition  as a result of our merger with predix  our expenses have increased as a result of the addition of our newly acquired therapeutic research and development and commercialization efforts 
as a result  we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all  and if we do  we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the timeframe expected by investors  the market price of our common stock may decline and consequently our business may not be sustainable 
our prior stock option practices may result in significant liability 
as described in the explanatory note to this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements  in december  our board of directors created a special committee of independent directors to conduct  with the assistance of outside legal counsel and outside forensic accounting consultants  an investigation of our historical stock option practices 
the special committee has completed its investigation and has concluded that certain employees  including certain of our former senior management  prior to the change in our senior management in connection with the merger with predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc on august   participated in retrospective date selection for the grant of certain stock options and re priced  as defined by financial accounting standards  certain options during the period from through accordingly  our audit committee has concluded that  pursuant to accounting principles board no 
apb and related interpretations  the accounting measurement date for the stock option grants for which those members of our former senior management had restrospectively selected grant dates for certain grants awarded between february and february  covering options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock  differed from the measurement dates previously used for such stock awards 
in addition  we determined that  certain of our former senior management re priced  as defined by financial accounting standards  to different prices approximately million stock options awarded during the period between june and march in addition  during the course of the option review  we identified approximately million options in which other dating errors resulted in stock options with grant dates that failed to meet the measurement date criteria of apb as a result  revised measurement dates were applied to the option grants with administrative errors and option grants for which certain of our former senior management retrospectively selected grant dates for the grant and for options that were re priced  as defined by financial accounting standards we revised our accounting for such re priced awards from accounting for the grants as fixed awards to accounting for the grants as variable awards 
accounting for a variable award requires us to revalue the re priced option to its then intrinsic value at the end of each reporting period until such option has been exercised or canceled 
in addition  we have recorded adjustments to our financial 
table of contents statements to record compensation expense for approximately  stock options granted to non employees to recognize the fair value of such options 
we also recorded compensation expense for approximately  stock options for which we modified the original terms of the stock award 
as a result of these adjustments  we have recorded million in additional stock based compensation expense for the years through the amount of compensation expense recorded for stock awards in which we revised measurement dates is net of forfeitures related to employee terminations 
the additional stock based compensation expense for stock awards in which the company s former senior management retrospectively selected dates for the grant is being amortized over the service period relating to each option  typically five years 
the company has accrued payroll tax expense of approximately million relating to employer and employee payroll taxes  interest and penalties it estimates it will owe as a result of the modifications to exercised options previously considered incentive stock options that should have been taxed as non qualified stock options 
our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements expose us to greater risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 
the securities and exchange commission has advised us that it has commenced an informal investigation regarding our stock option grants 
we are cooperating with that investigation 
in the event of any litigation or regulatory proceeding involving a finding or assertion by the securities and exchange commission  other federal or state governmental agencies  or any third party that our past stock option practices violated the federal securities laws or other laws  we may be required to pay fines  penalties or other amounts  may be subject to other remedies or remedial actions  and or may be required to further restate prior period financial statements or adjust current period financial statements 
in addition  considerable legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 
we have not been in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and may continue to face compliance issues with both 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  there may be a material adverse effect on the company and our stockholders 
due to the special committee investigation and resulting restatement  we could not file our annual report on form k with the sec on time and face the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global market 
on april   we received a nasdaq staff determination letter indicating that the we are not in compliance with marketplace rule c  which requires timely filing of periodic reports with nasdaq for continued listing  and we expect to file our request for a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel within the prescribed time period 
with the filing of this annual report on form k  we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
however  if the sec has comments on this annual report on form k or other reports that we previously filed that require us to file an amended report  or if the nasdaq listing qualifications panel does not concur that we are in compliance with applicable listing requirements  we may be unable to maintain an effective listing of our stock on a national securities exchange 
if this happens  the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we would not be able to issue stock options or other equity awards to our employees or allow them to exercise their outstanding options  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  although our convertible senior notes do not mature until  noteholders may require us to repurchase these notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events including  but not limited to  the termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
if we are unsuccessful in our appeal process for vasovist with the fda  we may never obtain approval to market and sell vasovist in the united states and our revenues will be materially harmed 
vasovist has not been approved for marketing and sale in the united states by the fda 
in connection with a new drug application  or nda  that we submitted for vasovist in december  we received an approvable letter from the fda in january in which the fda requested additional clinical trials prior to 
table of contents approval 
in may  we submitted a response to the fda approvable letter  which was accepted by the fda as a complete response in june in november  the fda provided us with a second approvable letter which indicated that at least one additional clinical trial and a re read of images obtained in certain previously completed phase trials will be necessary before the fda could approve vasovist 
we believe that these trials would require a substantial period of time to complete 
we have had three meetings with the fda since receiving the second approvable letter to discuss the path forward for vasovist in the united states 
after considering the parameters of the additional clinical trials requested by the fda  we filed a formal appeal with the fda asking the fda to approve vasovist and to utilize an advisory committee as part of the appeal process 
in august  the fda denied our appeal and suggested that we conduct two new clinical trials for vasovist 
in february  we filed our second formal appeal with the fda asking the fda to approve vasovist and to utilize an advisory committee as part of the appeal process 
the fda informed us that the response to our appeal regarding vasovist will extend beyond the originally anticipated day period 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding the appeals process 
the approval  timeliness of approval or labeling of vasovist are subject to significant uncertainties related to a number of factors  including the process of reaching agreement with the fda on the clinical data and on any clinical trial protocol required for regulatory approval of vasovist  a re read  or reanalysis  of images obtained from completed phase trials by a new group of radiologists  the timing and process of conducting any clinical trials that may be ultimately required if the appeal process ultimately ends in denial of our suggested path forward  obtaining the desired outcomes of any required clinical trials  and fda s review process and conclusions regarding any additional vasovist regulatory submissions 
we cannot assure you that the appeal process will be successful or that we will be able to reach agreement with the fda on the design or clinical endpoints required for additional clinical trials or re read of images from the completed phase trials that may be required if the appeal process ultimately ends in the denial of our suggested path forward 
further  we cannot assure you that any such agreed upon clinical trials will be feasible for us to conduct or whether such trials will be completed in a commercially reasonable timeframe  if at all 
any further clinical trials that are required could take several years to complete 
if the fda does not approve vasovist  then we will not receive revenues based on sales of vasovist in the united states 
even if ultimately approved  we do not expect revenues from the commercial sales of any of our product candidates  other than vasovist  for at least several years 
we have never had a commercially available product in the united states and we may never succeed in developing marketable products 
we have never had any product candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale in the united states and do not expect to have any commercial therapeutic products available in the united states for at least the next several years  if at all 
in september  results from our pivotal phase clinical trial of our prx product candidate for generalized anxiety disorder demonstrated that prx did not achieve a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary endpoint with respect to generalized anxiety disorder 
prior to obtaining results from this trial  prx was our most advanced therapeutic drug candidate 
based on these trial results  however  we have discontinued our development efforts with respect to prx in anxiety and currently are focusing our development efforts for this product candidate in depression 
prx has not been tested in patients with a primary diagnosis of major depression and will require significant further additional clinical testing for that indication 
in addition  although our vasovist imaging product has been approved for commercial sale in the european union  australia  switzerland  iceland  norway and canada  and is currently being marketed in europe by bayer schering pharma ag  germany  we have not obtained approval of vasovist in the united states and do not expect any significant income or royalties as a result of sales of vasovist for the foreseeable future 
in august  the fda denied our formal appeal to approve vasovist and suggested that we conduct two new clinical 
table of contents trials for vasovist 
accordingly  the approval of vasovist by the fda is subject to significant uncertainty and we may never obtain regulatory approval to market vasovist in the united states 
in addition to prx and vasovist  each of our four other clinical stage drug candidates in the united states require additional clinical studies prx for the treatment of two types of pulmonary hypertension pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  which began a phase clinical trial in august  and pulmonary arterial hypertension  prx for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  which entered a phase clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  prx for the treatment of obesity and cognitive impairment  which commenced phase clinical trials in june  and ep r  a contrast agent designed to enable the identification of blood clots using mri  which completed a phase a clinical trial in june prior to the initiation of our phase clinical trial  prx had never been tested in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has never been tested in patients with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension 
prx is currently being tested in patients with obesity and has never been tested in patients with cognitive impairment 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early stage clinical development 
for example  sanofi aventis discontinued the development of its product candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease designed to target the ht protein receptor due to lack of efficacy 
this compound is believed to have the same mechanism of action as prx  was more advanced in clinical development and was more potent in in vitro assays 
accordingly  the results from the completed and ongoing studies and trials for our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage clinical trials 
in addition  bayer schering pharma ag  germany declined to exercise an option to exclusively license ep r and  as a result  there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future clinical development plan of ep r and depends upon many factors  including our ability to enter into a collaboration to continue the development of ep r 
if we are unable to find a new collaborative partner  we may bear the expenses of further clinical development ourselves  and these expenses would be significant 
if we are unable to develop one or more marketable products in the united states  or elsewhere  our results of operations  business and future prospects would be materially harmed 
if we are unable to obtain required regulatory approval of our therapeutic product candidates  we will be unable to market and sell our therapeutic product candidates and our business will be materially harmed 
our existing therapeutic product candidates and any other product candidates we may discover or acquire and seek to commercialize are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and similar regulatory agencies in other countries relating to development  clinical trials  manufacturing and commercialization 
in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions  rigorous pre clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review process must be successfully completed before a new product candidate can be sold 
satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly  time consuming  uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays 
the time required to obtain approval by the fda is unpredictable but typically exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials  depending upon many factors  including the complexity of the product candidate 
we initiated clinical trials for prx  prx  prx and prx in may  february  december and june  respectively  and thus far  these therapeutic product candidates have been studied in only a small number of patients 
early stage clinical trials in small numbers of patients are often not predictive of results in later stage clinical trials with a larger and more diverse patient population 
even product candidates with favorable results in late stage pivotal clinical trials may fail to get approved for commercialization for many reasons  including our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for a particular indication  our inability to demonstrate that a product candidate s benefits outweigh its risks  our inability to demonstrate that the product candidate presents a significant advantage over existing therapies  
table of contents the fda s or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreement with the manner in which we and our collaborators interpret the data from pre clinical studies or clinical trials  the fda s or comparable foreign regulatory authorities failure to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities or the processes or facilities of our collaborators  or a change in the approval policies or regulations of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the relevant regulatory authorities may not approve any of our applications for marketing authorization relating to any of our product candidates  or additional applications for or variations to marketing authorizations that we may make in the future as to these or other product candidates 
among other things  we have had only limited experience in preparing applications and obtaining regulatory approvals 
if approval is granted  it may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of the product candidate 
if approval of an application to market product candidates is not granted on a timely basis or at all  or if we are unable to maintain our approval  our business may be materially harmed 
it is possible that none of our product candidates or any other product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them  which would materially harm our business 
our clinical trials may not yield results that will enable us to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
we will only receive regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or the applicable foreign regulatory agency  in well designed and conducted clinical trials  that the product candidate is safe and effective and otherwise meets the appropriate standards required for approval for a particular indication 
clinical trials are lengthy  complex and extremely expensive processes with uncertain results 
for example  results from our recently completed phase clinical trial of prx in generalized anxiety disorder  which was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prx as measured by the change from baseline in the hamilton rating scale for anxiety compared to placebo  demonstrated that prx did not achieve a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary endpoint with respect to generalized anxiety disorder 
based on these results  we have discontinued our development efforts of prx in anxiety 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  including filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to gain approval by the fda 
our nda for vasovist has not been  and may never be  approved by the fda and we have not submitted an nda to the fda for any of our other product candidates 
this limited experience may result in longer regulatory processes in connection with our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates 
with respect to both our current product candidates in human clinical trials and our research product candidates which may be suitable for testing in human clinical trials at some point in the future  we face risks including that the product candidate may not prove to be safe and efficacious  the dosage form of the product candidate may not deliver reproducible amounts of product to patients  patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested  the results of later stage clinical trials may not confirm the positive results of earlier trials  the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory agencies for approval  and the fda or other regulatory agencies may require additional or expanded trials 
of the large number of product candidates in development  only a small percentage result in the submission of an nda to the fda and even fewer are approved for commercialization 
if we fail to 
table of contents demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  we will not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to commercialize these product candidates 
the results from pre clinical testing of a product candidate that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials 
in addition  the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale  advanced stage clinical trials 
our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may seek to develop in the future may never complete the clinical testing necessary to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals for us to begin selling them 
if clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged or delayed  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis  which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales 
we may encounter problems with our completed  ongoing or planned clinical trials for our product candidates that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them 
a number of events  including any of the following  could delay the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval or enter into collaborations for  or market or sell  a particular product candidate  including any of our current clinical stage product candidates conditions imposed on us by the fda or any foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  delays in obtaining  or our inability to obtain  required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials  delay in developing a clinical dosage form  insufficient supply or deficient quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials  negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials  or results that are inconsistent with earlier results  that necessitate additional clinical study  serious and or unexpected product related side effects experienced by subjects in clinical trials  or failure of our third party contractors or our investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner 
regulatory authorities  clinical investigators  institutional review boards  data safety monitoring boards and the hospitals at which our clinical trials are conducted all have the power to stop our clinical trials prior to completion 
our clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin as planned  may need to be restructured  and may not be completed on schedule  if at all 
for example  in september  after discussions with the fda  we expanded our initial target indication for vasovist from one specific body region  the aortoiliac region  to a broader indication that included the entire body s vascular system  except for the heart 
this expansion required us to add two new clinical trials to our then existing phase clinical trial program 
this change to the phase clinical trial program and the associated delay in the startup of new clinical centers resulted in an approximate month delay in our nda submission and an increase in costs associated with the program 
delays in clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates 
in addition  if our clinical trials for our product candidates are delayed  our competitors may be able to bring product candidates to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced 
in addition  the number and complexity of clinical trials needed to achieve regulatory approval for our therapeutic drug candidates  including but not limited to prx  our product candidate for the treatment of depression  and prx  our product candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  could be significant 
achieving primary efficacy endpoints in depression and anxiety trials is difficult due to the significant placebo effect commonly observed in trials in these patient populations 
for example  results from our recently completed phase clinical trial of prx demonstrated that the product candidate did not achieve a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary endpoint with respect to 
table of contents generalized anxiety disorder 
based on these results  we have discontinued our development efforts with respect to prx in anxiety and expect to focus our efforts with respect to prx in depression 
in addition  we must also submit the results of a two year carcinogenicity study of prx prior to its approval 
we have not yet initiated this study and intend to conduct this study prior to submitting an nda to the fda 
if the clinical development of prx is delayed as a result of these matters  additional requirements set forth by the fda  including requirements related to confirming the correct dose for prx  or otherwise  the time and cost of the development of prx could increase significantly 
we have never generated positive cash flow  and if we fail to generate revenue  it will have a material adverse effect on our business 
to date  we have received revenues from payments made under licensing  royalty arrangements and product development and marketing agreements with strategic collaborators 
in particular  our revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million and consisted of million of product development revenue from bayer schering pharma ag  germany and cfft  million of royalty revenue related to the bracco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany agreements  and million of license fee revenue related to the bayer schering pharma ag  germany  amgen  tyco  glaxosmithkline  cfft  and bracco agreements 
in addition to these sources of revenue  we have financed our operations to date through public stock and debt offerings  private sales of equity securities and equipment lease financings 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance with the terms of our collaboration and licensing agreements  the revenues derived from them are subject to fluctuation in timing and amount 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under our existing collaboration or licensing agreements  these agreements may be subject to disputes and  additionally  these agreements may be terminated upon certain circumstances 
therefore  to achieve profitable and sustainable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  introduce  market and sell products 
we may not receive revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates for the next several years because we  and our partners  may not successfully complete our product development efforts  obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner  if at all  manufacture our product candidates at an acceptable cost and with acceptable quality  or successfully market any approved products 
as a result  we may never generate revenues from sales of our product candidates and our failure to generate positive cash flow could cause our business to fail 
we depend on our strategic collaborators for support in product development and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates and  if approved  for product marketing 
our product development programs and potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses 
our strategy includes collaborating with leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology or other companies to assist us in further developing and potentially commercializing our product candidates requiring large commercial sales and marketing infrastructures 
we may also seek to enter into such collaborations for our other product candidates  especially for target indications in which the potential collaborator has particular expertise or that involve a large  primary care market that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  we depend  and expect to continue to depend  on strategic collaborators for support in a variety of other activities including manufacturing  marketing and distribution of our product candidates in the united states and abroad  if the fda and corresponding foreign agencies approve our product candidates for marketing 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and these collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate and document 
for instance  in may  we concluded a research collaboration with bayer schering pharma ag  germany for the development of certain potential imaging product candidates 
we are in discussions  and expect to continue discussions  with bayer schering pharma ag  germany regarding the disposition of the research products under this research collaboration 
we cannot predict how the disposition or winding down of 
table of contents the individual research programs will occur  or whether we will be able to take forward any of these research programs ourselves or find alternative partners for these programs 
we may not be able to enter into any such collaboration on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if that were to occur  we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate  reduce or delay one or more of our development programs or potential commercialization  or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense 
for instance  on july   bayer schering pharma ag  germany notified us that it decided not to exercise its option to exclusively license ep r 
as a result  we intend to pursue a collaboration for the continued development of ep r with new potential partners  who may negotiate provisions that allow them to terminate their agreements with us prior to the expiration of the negotiated term under certain circumstances 
if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development  potential regulatory approval or commercialization activities on our own  we will need to obtain additional capital  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we do not obtain sufficient funds  we will not be able to complete clinical development of our product candidates or bring our product candidates to market 
further  our receipt of revenues from strategic alliances is affected by the level of efforts of our collaborators 
our collaborators may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of a product candidate in their respective territories  or they may not successfully market product candidates 
if we encounter difficulties enrolling subjects in our clinical trials for our product candidates  or subjects drop out of trials in progress for our product candidates  our trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected 
the timing of completion of clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and the availability of alternative treatments 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and prolonged clinical development 
in addition  patients may withdraw from a clinical trial for a variety of reasons 
if we fail to accrue and maintain the number of patients into one of our clinical trials for which the clinical trial was designed  the statistical power of that clinical trial may be reduced which would make it harder to demonstrate that the product candidates being tested in such clinical trial are safe and effective 
we may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of qualified patients in a timely or cost effective manner 
for example  we experienced difficulty in enrolling healthy elderly volunteers in our phase clinical trial for prx any future delays in patient enrollment could result in increased costs and longer development times 
enrollment of patients in our clinical trials for our product candidates is affected by many factors  including the limited size of the patient population and the availability of commercial products for certain target indications  including pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  the nature and design of the trial protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of other effective treatments for the relevant disease whether approved or experimental  the eligibility criteria for enrollment in our clinical trials  perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study  and competing studies or trials 
in addition  the fda could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our product candidates 
if we have difficulty enrolling or retaining a sufficient number of patients to participate and complete our clinical trials for our product candidates as planned  we may need to delay or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials 
delays in enrolling patients in these clinical 
table of contents trials or the withdrawal of subjects enrolled in these clinical trials would adversely affect our ability to develop and seek approval for our product candidates  could delay or eliminate our ability to generate product candidates and revenue and could impose significant additional costs on us 
we may need to raise additional funds necessary to fund our operations  and if we do not do so  we may not be able to implement our business plan 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through our public offerings of common stock  private sales of equity securities  debt financing  equipment lease financings  product development revenue  and royalty and license payments from our strategic partners 
although we believe that we have adequate funding to fund our operations through  we may need to raise substantial additional funds for research  development and other expenses through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances or otherwise 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both us and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our product candidates gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing and any new research and development programs  the extent to which we are required to pay the remaining million portion of the milestone payment in connection with the predix merger in cash  changes in our strategy or our planned activities  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our product candidates  and the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we incur additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  thus limiting funds available for our business activities 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  when we desire them  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our software products  services and hosted solutions  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
our therapeutic product candidates are currently unformulated 
all of our therapeutic product candidates  including prx  prx  prx and prx  are currently unformulated 
the lack of an optimized and commercially viable formulation during clinical trials may have a significant impact in the overall development and commercialization of these therapeutic product candidates  including the current dosage may not provide reproducible amounts of product  the pharmaceutical development of a commercially viable formulation may add significant cost and time to our clinical development programs for therapeutics  
table of contents additional trials may be required if the new formulation is not bioequivalent to formulations already used in clinical trials  future clinical trials may be delayed in order to identify  develop  optimize  manufacture and certify a commercially viable formulation  and regulatory filings  and or commercial launch may be delayed due to the lack of a commercial process for cgmp manufacturing of the new formulation 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially harm our business 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for our product candidates could prevent us from selling our product candidates in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement for marketing our product candidates outside the united states vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing 
we have no experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates 
although the use of vasovist has been approved in the european union  as well as canada  iceland  norway  switzerland and australia  bayer schering pharma ag  germany is responsible for obtaining foreign regulatory approvals for vasovist 
the time required to obtain approvals outside the united states may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the fda 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our product candidates 
our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements even if they receive marketing approval  and if we fail to comply with requirements  we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be temporarily or permanently suspended 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate  the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements  including requirements relating to manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping 
in addition  as clinical experience with a product expands after approval because it is typically used by a greater number of patients after approval than during clinical trials  side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre approval clinical trials 
we are required to maintain pharmacovigilance systems for collecting and reporting information concerning suspected adverse reactions to our product candidates 
in response to pharmacovigilance reports  regulatory authorities may initiate proceedings to revise the prescribing information for our product candidates or to suspend or revoke our marketing authorizations 
procedural safeguards are often limited  and marketing authorizations can be suspended with little or no advance notice 
both before and after approval of a product  quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform to cgmp 
regulatory authorities  including the european medicines agency  or emea  and the fda  periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp 
accordingly  we and our contract manufacturers will need to continue to expend time  funds  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda  the emea and other applicable us and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved commercial products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other setbacks  including restrictions on the products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes  warning letters  civil or criminal penalties  fines  
table of contents injunctions  product seizures or detentions  import bans  product recalls and related publicity requirements  unanticipated expenditures  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications 
the imposition on us of any of the foregoing could materially harm our results of operations 
in addition to regulations adopted by the emea  the fda  and other foreign regulatory authorities  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other federal  state  and local regulations 
we are focusing our therapeutic product discovery and development efforts on g protein coupled receptor and ion channel targeted product candidates  which have historically had a high incidence of adverse side effects 
despite commercial success  many g protein coupled receptor  or gpcr  and ion channel targeted products have been associated with a high incidence of adverse side effects due in part to poor selectivity in binding to their target protein  resulting in also binding to other off target proteins 
we believe we are designing our therapeutic product candidates to be highly selective and as a result to have a favorable side effect profile 
however  all of our therapeutic product candidates are in early stages of development  and although our clinical therapeutic product candidates have to date exhibited acceptable side effect profiles in clinical trials in a limited number of subjects  we cannot assure you that these results will be repeated in larger scale trials 
if serious side effects occur in later stage clinical trials of our therapeutic product candidates  we may not receive regulatory approval to commercialize them 
even if any of our therapeutic product candidates receive regulatory approval  if they do not exhibit a more favorable side effect profile than existing therapies  our competitive position could be substantially diminished 
the application of our in silico therapeutic product discovery technology and approach may be limited to a subset of therapeutically useful proteins  which may reduce the opportunities to develop and commercialize product candidates against other important therapeutic targets 
to date  our technology and approach has generated clinical therapeutic product candidates  including prx  prx  prx and prx  which mimic the activity of a small molecule  serotonin  within a class of gpcr proteins known as serotonergic receptors 
the activity is achieved through binding of the ligand  serotonin  to a particular region of the protein that spans the cell membrane 
these gpcrs and mechanisms of interaction represent a small subset of all known therapeutically relevant gpcrs 
the application of our in silico technology to other known therapeutically relevant gpcr targets based on large molecule ligands and other interactions is unknown 
ion channels can consist of multiple protein subunits that have complex and subtle mechanisms of activation and inactivation 
therefore  it may be difficult to apply our proprietary product discovery technology to small molecule ion channel targets 
although we believe that the in silico technology platform can be utilized and developed to discover such small molecules  we cannot ensure that our in silico technology and approach will generate clinical candidates for all gpcrs and ion channels that are important targets for therapeutic intervention 

table of contents integrating our organization with predix may divert management s attention away from our operations and  if we are unsuccessful in integrating our companies  we may not be able to operate efficiently after the merger 
achieving the benefits of our merger with predix will depend in part on the successful integration of our operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process requires coordination of different development  regulatory  administrative and commercial teams  and involves the integration of systems  applications  policies  procedures  business processes and operations 
this may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on scientific and regulatory matters 
problems in integrating financial reporting could result in control issues  including unplanned costs 
delays in successfully integrating and managing employee benefits could lead to dissatisfaction and employee turnover 
in addition  the combination of our organizations may result in greater competition for resources and elimination of research and development programs that might otherwise be successfully completed  especially in light of the difference in our current imaging business and therapeutic business 
if we cannot successfully integrate our operations and personnel  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger 
moreover  the diversion of management s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could result in delays in the companies clinical trial programs and could otherwise harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our competitors may develop products that are less expensive  safer or more effective  which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any future products that we may commercialize 
competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and expected to increase 
we face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in product discovery activities or funding  both in the united states and abroad 
some of these competitors have therapeutic products or are pursuing the development of therapeutic product candidates that target the same diseases and conditions that are the focus of our clinical stage therapeutic product candidates  including the following prx if approved  prx  the product candidate we are developing for the treatment of depression  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  pfizer inc 
and wyeth  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development from other companies  including sanofi aventis and fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc 
we believe that there are over therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials or that have been submitted for approval for the treatment of depression 
prx if approved  prx  the product candidate we are developing for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  inc  johnson johnson  novartis and pfizer  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development from other companies  including myriad genetics and neurochem 
we believe that there are over therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
prx if approved  prx  the product candidate we are developing for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension  will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as actelion  glaxosmithkline plc  pfizer inc and united therapeutics corporation  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development by other companies such as encysive pharmaceuticals inc and gilead sciences  inc we believe that there are approximately ten therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials or that have been submitted for approval for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and or pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
prx if approved for the treatment of obesity  prx will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as abbott laboratories and roche holding ltd  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development by other companies  such as sanofi aventis and arena pharmaceuticals  inc 
we believe that there are over therapeutic 
table of contents product candidates in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity 
if approved for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with alzheimer s disease or schizophrenia  prx will compete with approved products from such pharmaceutical companies as forest laboratories  inc  johnson johnson  novartis ag and pfizer inc  and may compete with several therapeutic product candidates in clinical development from other companies  including glaxosmithkline plc and saegis pharmaceuticals  inc we believe that there are over therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with alzheimer s disease or schizophrenia 
we expect that many patents covering commercial therapeutic products for these indications will expire in the next four to nine years  which will result in greater competition in these indications resulting from companies producing generic versions of the commercial products 
many of our competitors have therapeutic products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may develop superior technologies or methods to identify and validate therapeutic product targets and to discover novel small molecule products 
our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any therapeutic products that we may develop 
in addition  there are a number of general use mri agents approved for marketing in the united states  and in certain foreign markets that  if used or developed for magnetic resonance angiography  are likely to compete with vasovist 
such products include magnevist and gadovist by bayer schering pharma ag  germany  dotarem by guerbet  sa  omniscan by ge healthcare  prohance and multihance by bracco and optimark by tyco international ltd 
we are aware of five agents under clinical development that have been or are being evaluated for use in magnetic resonance angiography bayer schering pharma ag  germany s gadomer and shuc  guerbet  sa s vistarem  bracco s b  ferropharm gmbh s code vsop c  and advanced magnetics inc ferumoxytol 
moreover  there are several well established medical imaging methods that currently compete and will continue to compete with mri  including digital subtraction angiography  which is an improved form of x ray angiography  computed tomography angiography  nuclear medicine and ultrasound  and there are companies that are actively developing the capabilities of these competing methods to enhance their effectiveness in vascular system imaging 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in the future in developing therapeutic or imaging products that are more effective than any that we are developing 
we believe that our ability to compete in developing commercial products depends on a number of factors  including the success and timeliness with which we complete fda trials  the breadth of applications  if any  for which our product candidates receive approval  and the effectiveness  cost  safety and ease of use of our product candidates in comparison to the products of our competitors 
in addition  these companies may be more successful than we are in developing  manufacturing and marketing their imaging products 
in addition  many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater capital  research and development resources  manufacturing  sales and marketing experience and capabilities 
smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors  particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies 
our competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing products that are more effective  safer  more affordable or more easily administered than our product candidates and may achieve patent protection or commercialize product candidates sooner than us 
any inability to compete successfully on our part will have a materially adverse impact on our business and operating results 
if the market does not accept our technology and product candidates  we may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability 
the commercial success of our product candidates  even if approved for marketing by the fda and corresponding foreign agencies  depends on their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
market acceptance  and thus sales of our products  will depend on several factors  including safety  cost effectiveness relative to alternative therapies  methods or products  
table of contents availability of third party reimbursement  ease of administration  clinical efficacy  and availability of competitive products 
if any of our product candidates  when and if commercialized  do not achieve market acceptance  we may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  market acceptance of our imaging product candidates will also depend on our ability and that of our strategic partners to educate the medical community and third party payors about the benefits of diagnostic imaging with vasovist enhanced magnetic resonance angiography compared to imaging with other technologies 
while we believe that contrast agents are currently used in an estimated to of all mri exams  there are no mri agents approved by the fda for vascular imaging 
furthermore  clinical use of magnetic resonance angiography has been limited and use of magnetic resonance angiography for some vascular disease imaging has occurred mainly in research and academic centers 
vasovist represents a new approach to imaging the non coronary vascular system  and market acceptance both of magnetic resonance angiography as an appropriate imaging technique for the non coronary vascular system  and of vasovist  is critical to our success 
we may not be able to keep up with the rapid technological change in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  which could make any of our future approved therapeutic products obsolete and reduce our revenue 
biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
we believe that our proprietary therapeutic product discovery technology and approach enables structure based discovery and optimization of certain gpcr and ion channel targeted drug candidates 
however  our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing gpcr and ion channel targeted drug discovery approaches or the development of new or different approaches 
in addition  any future therapeutic products that we develop  including our clinical stage therapeutic product candidates  prx  prx  prx and prx  may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing those therapeutic product candidates  which may require that us to raise additional funds to continue our operations 
we are currently focusing our imaging development efforts primarily on vasovist and will have limited prospects for successful imaging operations if it does not prove successful 
since the merger with predix  we are focusing our imaging development efforts on our lead imaging product candidate  vasovist 
accordingly  we have decided to cease work on our research projects related to imaging and are seeking a partner to continue development of ep r 
we are no longer allocating resources to any imaging research or clinical programs other than the efforts required to continue to pursue fda approval of vasovist 
our efforts may not lead to commercially successful imaging products for a number of reasons  including the inability to be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  the lack of regulatory approvals or obtaining regulatory approvals that are narrower than we seek  inadequate financial resources to complete the development and commercialization of our imaging product candidates or their lack of acceptance in the marketplace 
our product candidates require significant biological testing  pre clinical testing  manufacturing and pharmaceutical development expertise and investment 
we rely primarily on external partners to complete these activities 
we have limited in house biological and pre clinical testing capabilities 
therefore  we rely heavily on third parties to perform in vitro potency  in vivo functional efficacy  animal toxicology and pharmacokinetics testing prior to advancing our product candidates into clinical trials 
we also do not have internal expertise to formulate our therapeutic product candidates 
in addition  we do not have  nor do we currently have plans to 
table of contents develop  full scale manufacturing capability for any of our products candidates  including vasovist 
we currently rely on evotec ltd  and johnson matthey pharma services for our therapeutic product substance manufacturing and testing  and on aptuit  inc and metrics  inc 
for our therapeutic product manufacturing and testing 
although we believe that we could replace these suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  if any of these third parties fail to fulfill their obligations to us or do not successfully compete the testing in a timely or acceptable manner  our therapeutic product development efforts could be negatively impacted and or delayed 
we rely on tyco as the primary manufacturer of vasovist for any future human clinical trials and commercial use 
together with bayer schering pharma ag  germany  we are considering alternative manufacturing arrangements for vasovist for commercial use  including the transfer of manufacturing to bayer schering pharma ag  germany tyco currently manufactures imaging agents for other technologies that will compete with vasovist 
in the event that tyco fails to fulfill its manufacturing responsibilities satisfactorily  bayer schering pharma ag  germany has the right to purchase vasovist from a third party or to manufacture the compound itself 
however  either course of action could materially delay the manufacture and development of vasovist 
bayer schering pharma ag  germany may not be able to find an alternative manufacturer 
in addition  bayer schering pharma ag  germany may not be able to manufacture vasovist itself in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities 
if we experience a delay in manufacturing of vasovist or any of our product candidates  it could result in a delay in their clinical testing  approval or commercialization and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain key management and other personnel  it would hurt our ability to compete 
our future business and operating results depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified directors  senior management and key technical personnel 
michael g 
kauffman  md  md  andrew md uprichard  md and kimberlee c 
drapkin  cpa  our chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer  respectively  are expected to play key roles moving forward 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain dr 
kauffman  dr 
uprichard  ms 
drapkin or any of our other key management and scientific personnel 
the loss of any of our key management and other personnel  or their failure to perform their current positions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to achieve our business objectives or to operate or compete in our industry may be seriously impaired 
competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
if we were to lose these employees to our competition  we could spend a significant amount of time and resources to replace them  which would impair our research and development or commercialization efforts 
gadolinium based imaging agents  such as vasovist and ep r  may cause adverse side effects which could limit our ability to receive approval for these product candidates and our ability to effectively market these product candidates  if approved 
vasovist and ep r  both mri contrast drugs  contain gadolinium 
in may  the danish medicines agency announced that it was investigating a possible link between the use of omniscan  an imaging agent containing gadolinium  and the development of a very rare skin disease in patients with severely impaired renal function who had been administered the imaging agent 
although the danish medicines agency stated that a causal relationship between omniscan and the skin changes had not been documented  they are conducting further investigations with respect to all mri contrast media containing gadolinium 
recent reports indicate that the disease also has developed following the administration of two other gadolinium containing agents optimark and magnevist  and has sometimes developed in patients with moderate renal impairment following administration of an agent 
it also has been reported that the disease  nephrogenic systemic fibrosis  may affect internal anatomy as well as the skin 
to date  over cases have been reported world wide 
the danish medicines agency has stated that a european committee on medicines safety has advised warnings regarding the disease be added to all gadolinium agents  and other agencies  including fda and health canada  have issued advisories regarding the use of gadolinium containing agents in patients with moderate to severely impaired renal function 
although we have reviewed our safety databases for vasovist and ep r and have found no instances of this rare disease  our databases 
table of contents may be too small to show such an effect  if it exists 
in the event gadolinium based imaging agents such as vasovist and ep r are linked to this very rare disease or other unanticipated side effects  such safety concerns could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain marketing approval for vasovist and or ep r or any such approval for use may be revoked 
any safety concerns could also materially harm our and our partners ability to successfully market vasovist or ep r 
our research and development efforts may not result in product candidates appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
we have historically spent significant resources on research and development and pre clinical studies of product candidates 
however  these efforts may not result in the development of product candidates appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
for example  our research may result in product candidates that are not expected to be effective in treating diseases or may reveal safety concerns with respect to product candidates 
we may postpone or terminate research and development of a product candidate or a program at any time for any reason such as the safety or effectiveness of the potential product  allocation of resources or unavailability of qualified research and development personnel 
the failure to generate high quality research and development candidates would negatively impact our ability to advance product candidates into human clinical testing and ultimately  negatively impact our ability to market and sell products 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates  and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities 
accordingly  these third party contractors may not complete activities on schedule  or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our trial design 
if our contract research organizations and other similar entities with which we are working do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may be required to replace them 
although we believe that there are other third party contractors we could engage to continue these activities  it may result in a delay of the affected trial 
accordingly  our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our product candidates may be delayed 
if we fail to get adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our product candidates after they are approved in the united states and abroad  we may have difficulty commercializing our product candidates 
we believe that reimbursement in the future will be subject to increased restrictions  both in the united states and in foreign markets 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the health care industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by us 
these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage on which drugs they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new products 
as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products 
we might need to conduct post marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of any future products to such payors satisfaction 
such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
our future products might not ultimately be considered cost effective 
there can be no assurance  in either the united states or foreign markets  that third party reimbursement will be available or adequate  that current reimbursement amounts will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for our product candidates or our ability to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our product candidate to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for the procedures in which our product candidate would be used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our product candidate and  consequently  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we obtain the necessary foreign regulatory approvals  market acceptance of our product candidates in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we and our strategic partners intend to seek international reimbursement approvals  although we cannot assure you that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our product candidate in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
we could be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent any such changes affect reimbursement for procedures in which our product candidates would be used 
us and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare 
for example  in some foreign markets  the government controls the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls 
in addition  recent changes in the medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future  which would limit our revenue and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals might change before our product candidates are approved for marketing 
adoption of such legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
we deal with hazardous materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
the nature of our research and development processes requires the use of hazardous substances and testing on certain laboratory animals 
accordingly  we are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes as well as the use of and care for laboratory animals 
although we are not currently  nor have we been  the subject of any investigations by a regulatory authority  we cannot assure you that we will not become the subject of any such investigation 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  state or federal authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations 
in addition  we could be liable for any civil damages that result  which may exceed our financial resources and may seriously harm our business 
due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we generate  we have determined that the cost to secure insurance coverage for environmental liability and toxic tort claims far exceeds the benefits 
accordingly  we do not maintain any insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials 
additionally  an accident could damage  or force us to shut down  our operations 
in addition  if we develop a manufacturing capacity  we may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations and would be subject to the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in our manufacturing process 
furthermore  current laws could change and new laws could be passed that may force us to change our policies and procedures  an event which could impose significant costs on us 
product liability claims could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 
the clinical testing of our products and the manufacturing and marketing of any approved products may expose us to product liability claims and we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we 
table of contents currently have limited product liability insurance for the use of our approved products and product candidates in clinical research  which is capped at million  but our coverage may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or adequate for liabilities we actually incur 
we do not have product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our product candidates  but intend to obtain such coverage when and if we commercialize our product candidates 
however  we may not be able to obtain adequate additional product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage  or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us  may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
political and military instability and other factors may adversely affect our operations in israel 
we have significant operations in israel and regional instability  military conditions  terrorist attacks  security concerns and other factors in israel may directly affect these operations 
our employees in israel are primarily computational chemists and are responsible for the computational chemistry for all of our therapeutic discovery stage programs 
accordingly  any disruption in our israeli operations could adversely affect our ability to advance our therapeutic discovery stage programs into clinical trials 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel  and in particular since  there has been an increased level of violence between israel and the palestinians 
any armed conflicts or political instability in the region could harm our operations in israel 
in addition  many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty  and  in the event of a war  military or other conflict  our employees could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time 
our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of time of one or more of our key employees or a significant number of our other employees due to military service 
furthermore  several countries restrict business with israel and israeli companies  and these restrictive laws and policies could harm our business 
intellectual property risks we depend on patents and other proprietary rights  and if they fail to protect our business  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the protection of our proprietary technologies is material to our business prospects 
we pursue patents for our product candidates in the united states and in other countries where we believe that significant market opportunities exist 
we own or license patents and patent applications on aspects of our core technology as well as many specific applications of this technology 
as of march   our patent portfolio included a total of issued us patents  issued foreign patents  two allowed us patent awaiting issuance  and pending patent applications in the us and other countries with claims covering the composition of matter and methods of use for all of our clinical stage product candidates 
we also exclusively license technology embodied in patent applications from ramot at tel aviv university ltd  the technology transfer company of tel aviv university 
physiome sciences  inc  a predecessor of predix  received us patent  which covers a computational system and method for modeling the heart 
this patent expires in even though we hold numerous patents and have made numerous patent applications  because the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms  including our patent positions  generally include complex legal and factual questions  our patent positions remain uncertain 
for example  because most patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing  we cannot be certain that the named applicants or inventors of the subject matter covered by our patent applications or patents  whether directly owned or licensed to us  were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
third parties may oppose  challenge  infringe upon  circumvent or seek to invalidate existing or future patents owned by or licensed to us 
a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid  not infringed or unenforceable and we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future 
even if we have valid patents  these patents still may not provide sufficient protection against competing products or processes 
if we are unable to successfully protect our proprietary methods and technologies  or if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  
table of contents we may not be able to prevent other companies from practicing our technology and  as a result  our competitive position may be harmed 
we depend on exclusively licensed technology from ramot at tel aviv university ltd 
and massachusetts general hospital and  if we lose either of these licenses  it is unlikely we could obtain such technology elsewhere  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach is in part embodied in technology that we license from ramot at tel aviv university ltd  the technology transfer company of tel aviv university 
all of our current clinical stage therapeutic drug candidates  prx  prx  prx and prx  were  at least in part  identified  characterized or developed using the licensed technology 
we are required to make various payments to ramot  as and when rights to any such drug candidates are ever sublicensed or any such drug candidates are commercialized 
because we have an ongoing obligation to pay annual minimum royalties to ramot and the license expires upon the expiration of such obligation  the license may not expire 
the license may  however  be terminated upon a breach by us or our bankruptcy 
in addition  under the terms of a license agreement that we have with mgh  we are the exclusive licensee to certain imaging technology  which relates to royalties we receive and to vasovist 
the license agreement imposes various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other obligations on us 
the license agreement expires on a country by country basis when the patents covered by the license agreement expire 
the majority of these patents expired in november one of these patents has been extended through supplementary protection certificates for primovist through may in certain european countries 
the license agreement does not contain a renewal provision 
if we fail to comply with our obligations under either of these license agreements  the respective license could convert from exclusive to nonexclusive  or terminate entirely 
it is unlikely that we would be able to obtain the technology licensed under either of these agreements elsewhere 
any such event would also mean that  with respect to our mgh license  we would not receive royalties from bracco for multihance or bayer schering pharma ag  germany for primovist and that we or bayer schering pharma ag  germany could not sell vasovist and  with respect to our ramot license  that we would not be able to sublicense or commercialize any of our current clinical stage therapeutic drug candidate  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  which could result in our incurrence of substantial costs and which could result in the forfeiture of these rights 
we may need to bring costly and time consuming litigation against third parties in order to enforce our issued or licensed patents  protect our trade secrets and know how  or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of proprietary rights of others 
in addition to being costly and time consuming  such lawsuits could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these lawsuits could also result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications 
we may not prevail and a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of an opposing party in any such lawsuits 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
in addition  the cost of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
other rights and measures that we rely upon to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to protect our products and services and could reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
while we require employees  collaborators  consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements  where appropriate  any of the following could still occur the agreements may be breached  
table of contents we may have inadequate remedies for any breach  proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors  or others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies 
if  as a result of the foregoing or otherwise  our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated  it would harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position 
moreover  several of our management and scientific personnel were formerly associated with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions 
in some cases  these individuals are conducting research in similar areas with which they were involved prior to joining us 
as a result  we  as well as these individuals  could be subject to claims of violation of trade secrets and similar claims 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others  and if we are unable to do so  we may not be able to sell our products 
our commercial success will depend  to a significant degree  on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents of others in the united states and abroad 
there may be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us relating to technologies we use in the development or use of certain of our contrast agents 
if any judicial or administrative proceeding upholds these or any third party patents as valid and enforceable  we could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the owners of each such patent  or to redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement 
for example  in november  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with dr 
martin r 
prince relating to dynamic magnetic resonance angiography 
under the terms of the intellectual property agreement  dr 
prince granted us certain discharges  licenses and releases in connection with the historic and future use of vasovist by us and agreed not to sue us for intellectual property infringement related to the use of vasovist 
we were required to pay an upfront fee of  royalties on sales of vasovist and approximately  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately million based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the agreement 
in addition  we agreed to supply dr 
prince with approximately  worth of vasovist annually throughout the patent life of vasovist 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional licenses if required in the future 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around these or any third party patents  we may be unable to sell our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if mri manufacturers are not able to enhance their hardware and software sufficiently  we will not be able to complete development of our contrast agent for the evaluation of cardiac indications 
although mri hardware and software is sufficient for the evaluation of non coronary vascular disease  which is our initial target indication  we believe that the technology is not as advanced for cardiac applications 
our initial nda filing for vasovist is related to non coronary vascular disease 
based on feasibility studies we completed in  however  the imaging technology available for cardiac applications  including coronary angiography and cardiac perfusion imaging  was not developed to the point where there was clear visualization of the cardiac region due to the effects of motion from breathing and from the beating of the heart 
in  we initiated phase feasibility trials of vasovist for cardiac indications using available software and hardware that can be adapted for coronary and cardiac perfusion data acquisition  and preliminary review of the data indicates that we have not resolved the technical issues related to this use of vasovist 
we have collaborated with a number of leading academic institutions and with ge healthcare  siemens medical systems and philips medical systems to help optimize cardiac imaging with vasovist 
we do not know when  or if  these techniques will enable vasovist to provide clinically relevant images in cardiac indications 
if mri device manufacturers are not able to enhance their scanners to perform clinically useful cardiac imaging  we will not be able to complete our development activities of vasovist for that application  thereby reducing the potential market for a product in this area 

table of contents risks related to our securities our stock price is volatile  which could subject us to securities class action litigation 
the market prices of the capital stock of medical technology companies have historically been very volatile and the market price of the shares of our common stock fluctuates 
the market price of our common stock is affected by numerous factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovation or new commercial products by us or our competitors  new collaborations entered into by us or our competitors  developments with respect to proprietary rights  including patent and litigation matters  results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  the timing of our achievement of regulatory milestones  conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other technology industries  adoption of new accounting standards affecting such industries  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  perceptions of the value of corporate transactions  and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions 
since the closing of our merger with predix and our for share reverse stock split on august   the closing price of our common stock ranged from to per share 
the last reported closing price for our common stock on march  was 
significant declines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital  attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of similarly staged companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  shareholders have often brought class action securities litigation against that company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
for example  in january  a securities class action was filed in us district court for the district of massachusetts against us and certain of our officers on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock between july  and january  the complaint alleged that we and the other defendants violated the securities exchange act of  as amended  by issuing a series of materially false and misleading statements to the market throughout the class period  which statements had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of our securities 
in january  the us district court for the district of massachusetts granted our motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute the shareholder class action lawsuit against us 
the dismissal was issued without prejudice after a hearing  which dismissal does not prevent another suit to be brought based on the same claims 
we significantly increased our leverage as a result of the sale of convertible senior notes due  and may be unable to repay  repurchase or redeem these notes if  and when  required 
in connection with the sale of convertible senior notes due  we have incurred indebtedness of million 
each  of senior notes is convertible into shares of our common stock representing a conversion price of approximately per share 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to regulatory approvals and sales of our products  as well as other financial and business factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
the amount of our indebtedness could  among other things make it difficult for us to make payments on the notes  make it difficult for us to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes on favorable terms  if at all  
table of contents make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
in addition  although our convertible senior notes do not mature until  noteholders may require us to repurchase these notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events under the notes  which include a change of control of us or termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
the definition of change in control set forth in the indenture governing the notes does not include certain mergers and similar transactions that are not deemed a change in control 
while we believe that our merger with predix did not constitute a change of control of us under the indenture  we cannot assure you that we will not become obligated to repurchase these notes  in whole or in part  as a result of the merger 
based on the current trading price of our common stock  we anticipate that in such event most  if not all  of the noteholders would tender their notes for repurchase 
we may not have enough funds or be able to arrange for additional financing to repurchase the notes tendered by the holders upon a designated event or otherwise 
any failure to repurchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might also constitute a default under the terms of our other debt 
if we are required to repurchase or redeem these notes prior to their maturity  whether as a result of the merger or otherwise  the financial position of the combined company would be materially adversely affected and the anticipated benefits of the merger would be significantly diminished 
future sales of common stock by our existing stockholders and former security holders of predix may cause the stock price of our common stock to fall 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders and former predix stockholders in the market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at an appropriate time and price 
certain anti takeover clauses in our charter and by laws and in delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  the possible issuance of preferred stock could discourage a proxy contest  make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of our board of directors 
a staggered board of directors and certain provisions of our by laws and of the state of delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
we are subject to section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which  subject to certain exceptions  restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us without action by the stockholders and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of our stock

table of contents the current lease at hayetzira street  israel expires october  we believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs until the expiration of the leases 
item legal proceedings from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits  claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us 
intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which  if imposed against us  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  or results of operations 
from time to time  third parties have asserted and may in the future assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology 
the sec is conducting an informal inquiry into our stock option grants and practices and related accounting 
we could be required to pay significant fines or penalties resulting from the inquiry 
on december   we created a special board committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our historical stock option practices 
the special committee has completed its investigation and has concluded that certain employees  including certain members of our former senior management  prior to the change in our senior management in connection with the merger with predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc on august   had retrospectively selected dates for the grant of certain stock options and re priced  as defined by financial accounting standards  certain options during the period from through as a result of this review  we restated our financial statements to record additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related payroll tax effects  with regard to certain past stock option grants 
our past stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements expose us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory  or other proceedings  as a result of which we could be found liable for damages  fines or other civil or other remedies or remedial actions  or be required to further restate prior period financial statements or adjust current period financial statements 
in addition  considerable legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 
due to the special committee investigation and the resulting restatement  we did not file on time this annual report on form k 
as a result  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter  dated april   stating that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements of marketplace rule c and  therefore  that our stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
we have filed a notice and requested a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
in addition  although our convertible senior notes do not mature until  noteholders may require us to repurchase these notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events including  but not limited to  the termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
with the filing of this annual report on form k  we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
however  we cannot predict whether the sec will review this annual report on form k and  if so  whether the sec will have comments on this annual report on form k or other reports that we previously filed that may require us to file amended reports with the sec 
in addition  we cannot predict whether the nasdaq listing qualifications panel will concur that we are in compliance with all relevant listing requirements 
if either of these events occur  we might be unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  and  therefore  we might be unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market or any other national securities exchange

overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical products to better diagnose  treat and manage patients 
we have four therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials targeting conditions such as depression  alzheimer s disease  cardiovascular disease and obesity 
in addition  we have two imaging agents in various stages of clinical development 
our blood pool imaging agent  vasovist  is approved for marketing in the european union  canada  iceland  norway  
table of contents switzerland and australia  and is currently marketed in europe 
we also have collaborations with smithkline beecham corporation glaxosmithkline  amgen  inc  cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  and bayer schering pharma ag  germany formerly known as schering ag 
the focus of our therapeutic drug discovery and development efforts is on the two classes of drug targets known as g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  and ion channels 
gpcrs and ion channels are classes of proteins embedded in the surface membrane of all cells and are responsible for mediating much of the biological signaling at the cellular level 
we believe that our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach addresses many of the inefficiencies associated with traditional gpcr and ion channel targeted drug discovery 
by integrating computer based  or in silico  technology with in house medicinal chemistry  we believe that we can rapidly identify and optimize highly selective drug candidates 
we focus on gpcr and ion channel drug targets whose role in disease has already been demonstrated in clinical trials or in preclinical studies 
in each of our four clinical stage therapeutic programs  we used our drug discovery technology and approach to optimize a lead compound into a clinical drug candidate in less than ten months  synthesizing fewer than compounds per program 
we moved each of these drug candidates into clinical trials in less than months from lead identification 
we believe our drug discovery technology and approach enables us to efficiently and cost effectively discover and develop gpcr and ion channel targeted drugs 
on august   we completed our acquisition of predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc predix pursuant to the terms of that certain agreement and plan of merger  dated as of april  as amended on july   by and among us  epix delaware  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and predix  as amended 
pursuant to the merger agreement  predix merged with and into epix delaware  inc and became a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
the merger with predix was primarily a stock transaction valued at approximately million  including the assumption of net debt at closing 
as part of the merger  we also assumed all outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of predix 
the purchase price includes a million milestone payment to the holders of predix stock  options and warrants payable in cash  stock or a combination of both 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  million of the milestone was paid in cash on october  the remaining million of the milestone payment will be paid primarily in shares of epix common stock on october   except to the extent that such shares would cause the former predix shareholders  warrantholders and optionholders to receive more than of outstanding shares measured as of the closing date immediately after such milestone payment when combined with all shares of epix common stock issued in the merger and issuable upon exercise of all predix options and warrants that we assumed in the merger 
the portion of the million milestone that cannot be paid in shares will be paid in cash with interest accrued at a rate of 
in addition  in connection with the merger  we effected a for reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
the following information has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results  which is more fully described in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the impact of the restatement on our net loss was a decrease in the loss of million in and an increase in the net loss of million in the adjustments did not affect our previously reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods 
the adjustments relate exclusively to stock option practices that predate the merger between us and predix 
we believe that our current procedures  controls and accounting practices ensure that the granting and exercising of options are executed in accordance with our stock option plan requirements and accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
previously filed annual reports on form k  form k a and quarterly reports on form q affected by the restatement have not been amended and should not be relied on 
findings of the stock option review on december   our board of directors formed a special committee of the board comprised solely of independent directors who had not served on our board prior to the merger with predix in august the purpose of the special committee was to investigate matters relating to our stock option grants 
the 
table of contents special committee has completed its investigation  having investigated both matters relating to the exercise of stock options by our former executive officers and other employees as well as our historical stock option granting practices 
during its investigation  the special committee retained outside legal counsel to assist it in its investigation 
in turn  legal counsel retained forensic accounting consultants to assist it and the special committee with accounting matters in connection with the investigation 
the investigation conducted by the special committee consisted  in part  of the review of voluminous hard copy and electronic files obtained from us as well as from other sources totaling approximately million documents 
in addition  interviews of twenty four of our current and former officers  directors  and employees and other persons totaling separate interviews were conducted in the course of the investigation 
from our initial public offering through march  our option grant processes and procedures were not consistently followed 
option grants during this period were either approved by the then chief executive officer or compensation committee of the board of directors 
all of the stock option grants requiring adjustment were granted during the years through which pre dates our merger with predix 
our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer joined epix in connection with the merger with predix 
none of the members of our current senior management participated in the approval  modification  retrospective price selection or re pricing of any stock option grants requiring adjustment 
stock option grants approval process prior to merger with predix during the period from our initial public offering through march  pursuant to authority delegated to him by the compensation committee  the then chief executive officer who had that position from december until he left the company in september approved stock option grants below a certain number of shares to employees who were not executive officers or members of our board of directors 
stock option grants to executive officers and to employees receiving option awards over certain thresholds required approval by the compensation committee 
stock option grants to outside directors were granted at fixed times each year in accordance with a stock option plan relating to stock option awards to independent directors 
evidence collected by the special committee indicates that the grant date associated with many of these stock options granted prior to our merger with predix in had been selected by certain employees  including certain members of our former senior management  retrospectively after the date indicated on the documents approving these options 
as a result of the evidence collected by the special committee  we concluded that the grant dates associated with these grants differed from the measurement date for these grants for financial accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles  as set forth in apb or in certain grants  resulted in re pricing of the stock options requiring us to account for these option grants as variable awards 
variable awards require revaluation of the option awards to their then intrinsic value at each reporting period until the option has been exercised or canceled 
in addition  in part as a result of such evidence of retrospective selection of grant dates with respect to certain grants  we also determined that adjustment of the measurement date for accounting purposes was appropriate for certain other grants for which we lacked information confirming that the grants had been approved on the date reflected in the documents approving each such grant 
all of our current executive officers  with the exception of dr 
andrew cg uprichard  joined epix in connection with the august  merger with predix 
dr 
uprichard joined epix in in march  dr 
uprichard was granted  stock options which were approved by the compensation committee 
subsequent to their approval  certain members of our former senior management re priced these options and all other options granted by the compensation committee on that same date 
dr 
uprichard was never part of the stock option approval process 
there were no other stock options granted to current executive officers that required a change in measurement date or resulted in the company recording compensation expense 
since the merger with predix  we have revised our stock option grant processes and procedures 
as a result  we have adopted a formal  written policy for stock option awards 
we believe that since our merger 
table of contents with predix  our current equity granting processes and practices have been consistently adhered to  and are accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our current stock option grant policy mandates the following stock option grants made in connection with our annual performance review will occur on the same fixed date or dates each year  such date or dates to be set by the board of directors to occur promptly after an announcement of our annual financial results stock options to executive officers and individual option awards of  options or greater must be approved by the compensation committee and all option grants that are not awarded in connection with our annual performance review  such as new hire and promotion grants  must be priced and granted on the last trading day of the month in which they were approved 
stock option grants requiring approval by the compensation committee cannot be approved via unanimous written consent  but may be approved only at an official meeting of the compensation committee at which minutes are recorded 
all three members of our compensation committee are independent directors 
our chief executive officer has the authority to approve stock option awards in certain circumstances if the individual grant is for less than  options and is not to an executive officer 
adjustments to measurement dates arising from evidence of retrospective selection of grant dates during the course of the special committee s stock option review  we identified approximately million stock options with grant dates that failed to meet the measurement date criteria of apb due to the retrospective selection of grant dates 
the measurement date for these twelve option grants covering approximately million shares was adjusted in compliance with apb as a result of evidence indicating that the grant date had been selected retrospectively  after the date reflected in the documents approving these grants 
of these grants  options to purchase approximately million shares were granted to former executive officers and options to purchase approximately million shares were granted to other employees 
adjustments to the apb measurement dates for these grants resulted in the recording of additional stock based compensation of million 
none of the approximately million stock options requiring measurement date adjustments due to the retrospective selection of the grant date were made to any of our current executive officers 
each grant in question was evaluated individually based on its particular facts and circumstances in each case  in light of the electronic and hard copy documentation and other evidence including information obtained from interviews of current and former employees  officers  directors  among others available to the special committee 
that documentation and information considered in connection with the measurement date adjustments that we have made included  but was not limited to minutes of compensation committee meetings  unanimous written consents signed by compensation committee members  and evidence relating to the date such consents were circulated for signature and or signed  information found in personnel files maintained for optionees  electronic mail messages and other electronic files maintained in our computer system and in backup media  documentation prepared in connection with our annual performance reviews of employees as part of the process of determining the allocation of stock option grants to individual employees  information as to the date of hire of the optionee  including if the grant was a new hire grant the date of any employment agreement or offer letter correspondence and other documentation supporting the option grant including  without limitation  memoranda  sec form filings  information concerning the date or dates on which the stock option was entered into our stock option tracking system  equity edge  and information obtained during interviews conducted by the special committee of numerous individuals  including former officers  directors  employees  and outside professionals 

table of contents based on the relevant facts and circumstances  electronic and other documentation  and other available information relevant to each grant  we applied the appropriate accounting standards to determine the proper measurement date for each grant at issue 
if the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects 
re priced stock options evidence collected by the special committee also indicated that during the period june through march  certain employees  including certain former members of our senior management  participated in the re pricing  as defined by financial accounting standards  of certain stock option grants subsequent to their approval by the compensation committee 
approximately million stock options were considered to be re priced and resulted in the recording of compensation expense during the years through totaling approximately million 
these options were considered to be re priced  as defined by financial accounting standards  as the prices at which these options were granted were selected by certain employees  including former members of our senior management after the award had been approved by the compensation committee and at prices different than original price on the date the option had been approved 
the accounting for stock awards that are re priced requires the option to be accounted for as a variable award and requires revaluation of the option to its intrinsic value at the end of each reporting period 
of these approximately million re priced options  options to purchase approximately million shares were granted to former executive officers  and options to purchase approximately million shares were granted to other employees 
other than a grant to dr 
uprichard discussed above  none of the re priced grants requiring adjustment of measurement dates for financial accounting purposes were made to any of our current executive officers 
each grant in question was evaluated individually based on its particular facts and circumstances in each case  in light of the electronic and hard copy documentation and other evidence including information obtained from interviews of current and former employees  officers  directors  among others available to the special committee 
for a description and discussion of the documentation and information considered by the committee and the company  see the section above entitled adjustments to measurement dates arising from evidence of retrospective selection of grant dates 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  electronic and other documentation  and other available information relevant to each grant  we applied the appropriate accounting standards to determine the proper accounting for the re priced options 
if the exercise price of the option granted was different than the fair value of our stock on the day the grant was approved and was selected after such approval  the option was considered to be re priced and was accounted for as a variable option award 
other dating errors in addition  during the course of the stock option review  we identified certain instances in which other dating errors resulted in stock options with grant dates that failed to meet the measurement date criteria of apb of these  the measurement date for nine option grants covering approximately million shares was adjusted in compliance with apb as a result of evidence indicating that the grant date selected failed to meet the measurement date criteria for apb the compensation expense resulting from the change in measurement dates for these million stock options was approximately million  which is net of forfeitures related to terminations 
the additional stock based compensation expense for the options with revised measurement dates resulting from other dating errors is being amortized over the service period relating to each option  typically five years 
none of these option grants were made to executive officers 
included in these nine stock option grants that we determined to require measurement date adjustment as a result of other dating errors is one grant for approximately  stock options made to two members of our board of directors  one former and one current 
in this instance  the grant date used was the day before the option grant was approved by our board of directors and the difference in our stock price on the two dates differed only by per share 
this was determined by us to be an administrative error 

table of contents other adjustments in addition  during the course of the stock option review  we identified certain instances in which adjustments to stock based compensation expense were required that were not related to changes in measurement dates  as follows grants made to consultants were erroneously accounted for under apb as if they had been made to employees 
to correctly account for these grants in accordance with eitf  we recorded million in additional stock based compensation during through with respect to seven option grants totaling approximately  shares  modifications were made to previously granted employee and consultant stock options that were not accounted for in accordance with apb and related interpretations  eitf and fas  as applicable 
the modifications included the extension of the post service exercise period for vested stock options of terminated employees and or consultants 
we recorded million in additional stock based compensation expense during through  to properly account for these modifications 
in  we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense equal to the gain recognized by employees when those employees sold stock options that were deemed to be disqualifying dispositions 
disqualifying dispositions are potential tax deductions for companies and do not require recognition as expense in a company s statement of operations 
as this accounting is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the stock compensation expense was reversed 
financial impact of the stock option review number of shares amount retrospective selection of grant date re priced options other dating errors consultant grants stock option modifications correction of erroneous stock compensation charge employee income and payroll taxes the million total in stock compensation expense shown above represents the aggregate stock based compensation for the affected options as a result of our stock option review and if applicable  is net of subsequent forfeitures related to employee terminations 
as we have and continue to recognize a net loss annually  there were no income tax adjustments necessary in connection with the restatement of any prior year financial statements other than to record an increase in our gross deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance 
we have  however  in connection with this restatement  recorded approximately million in payroll tax expense relating to employer and employee payroll taxes  interest and penalties we estimate we will owe as a result of the modifications to exercised options previously considered incentive stock options that should have been taxed as non qualified stock options 
the circumstances requiring adjustment of measurement dates occurred entirely before our merger with predix all of the grant dates that failed to meet the measurement date criteria of apb and all stock option re pricings relate to options granted during the years through all of our current executive officers  
table of contents with the exception of our president  andrew cg uprichard  cg  joined epix in connection with the august  merger with predix 
dr 
uprichard joined epix in dr 
uprichard has never been part of our stock option granting approval process 
with respect to the members of the compensation committee  the special committee found no evidence of intentional backdating or re pricing of option grants during the period relevant to the special committee s review 
certain members of our current compensation committee served on that committee prior to our merger with predix 
during the review  we determined that our option grant procedures and processes that existed prior to our merger with predix lacked adequate controls  and that documentation and recordkeeping relating to that granting process were insufficient in certain instances to verify measurement dates 
all of the epix employees responsible for making financial accounting judgments and decisions during the period prior to the merger with predix  which closed on august   had resigned on or before the merger closing date 
late sec filings and nasdaq delisting proceedings due to the special committee investigation and the resulting restatement  we did not file on time this annual report on form k 
as a result  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter  dated april   stating that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements of marketplace rule c and  therefore  that our stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
we have filed a notice and requested a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
with the filing of this annual report on form k  we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
however  sec comments on this annual report on form k or other reports that we previously filed or other factors could render us unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market or any other national securities exchange 
in addition  although our convertible senior notes do not mature until  noteholders may require us to repurchase these notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events including  but not limited to  the termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
restatement of our consolidated financial statements as a result of the findings of our stock option review  our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and have been restated 
the findings of our stock option review did not have a material effect on our interim and annual financial statements 
the restated consolidated financial statements include unaudited financial information for the interim periods of consistent with article of regulation s x

the effect on quarterly information was not material 
the restatement of our quarterly results for stock based compensation did not impact our previously reported revenue and did not significantly impact the trends in our financial condition or liquidity discussed in our previously filed quarterly reports on form q 
the impact of the restatement on our quarterly results is reflected in the quarterly information section of this item and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the stock compensation expense recorded during the quarterly periods in did impact the trends of our operating expenses during the period as the stock compensation charges resulting from the accounting for the re priced options changed the awards from fixed awards to variable which required us to remeasure the compensation charge for options 
table of contents at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
given the fluctuation in our stock price the charges varied accordingly 
the stock option review and the resulting stock compensation adjustments resulted in the following increases decreases in our operating costs during each of the four quarters of quarter ending march  june  september  december  research and development expense general and administrative expense total critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  research and development and employee stock compensation  as described below  require critical accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue relating to collaborations in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab 
revenue under collaborations may include the receipt of non refundable license fees  milestone payments  and research and development payments and royalties 
we recognize nonrefundable upfront license fees and guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development as revenue ratably over the development period  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
epix continually reviews such estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized 
milestone payments which represent a significant performance risk are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
milestone payments which are received at the time of initiation of a collaboration agreement or do not represent a significant performance risk are recognized ratably over the development period 
royalties are recognized as revenue when earned and reasonably estimable  which is typically upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee or cash 
reimbursements of research and development costs are recognized as revenue as the related costs are incurred 

table of contents product development revenue we recognize as revenue the cash consideration received from bayer schering pharma ag  germany for efforts provide by us in excess of our obligation under the agreement to expend of the costs to develop vasovist 
this revenue is recognized in the same period in which the costs are incurred 
with respect to payments due to bayer schering pharma ag  germany  if any  in connection with the vasovist development program  we would recognize such amounts as a reduction in revenue at the time bayer schering pharma ag  germany performs the research and development activities for which we are obligated to pay bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
on a monthly basis  we calculate the revenue or reduction in revenue  as the case may be  with respect to the collaboration with bayer schering pharma ag  germany for vasovist as follows we calculate our development costs directly related to vasovist 
we obtain cost reports  or an estimate of costs  from bayer schering pharma ag  germany for costs incurred by bayer schering pharma ag  germany related to the development of vasovist during the same period 
where estimates are used  we review the estimates and record  as necessary  adjustments in the subsequent quarter when we receive actual results from bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
to date  there have been no material adjustments 
we multiply our and bayer schering pharma ag  germany s development costs by approximately based on the contractual allocation of work contemplated under the agreement 
we then record the net difference as development revenue if the balance results in a payment to us and negative revenue if the balance results in a payment to bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
the result of this calculation is that we record revenue only for amounts we are owed by bayer schering pharma ag  germany in excess of of development expenses of the project in the particular period 
we would record a reduction to revenue for any amounts owed to bayer schering pharma ag  germany in the particular period 
to date  we have not been required to make any payments to bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
royalty revenue we earn royalty revenue pursuant to our sub license on certain of our patents to bracco imaging spa bracco 
with the expiration in of certain patents related to the sublicense with bracco  we received reduced royalty payments from bracco throughout the second half of  and we expect such payments to end in the first quarter of we are also entitled to receive a royalty on worldwide sales of primovist and on sales of vasovist outside of the united states by bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
royalty revenue is recognized based on actual revenues as reported by bracco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany to us in the period in which royalty reports are received 
license fee revenue we record license fee revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition 
pursuant to sab  we recognize revenue from non refundable license fees and milestone payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the period during which we have a substantial continuing obligation to perform services under the contract 
certain contracts require judgment to determine the period of continuing involvement by us and these estimates are subject to change based upon changes in facts and circumstances 
when milestone payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligations associated with the payment are completed 
research and development we account for research and development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  which requires that expenditures be expensed to operations as incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include employee 
table of contents salaries and related costs  third party service costs  the cost of preclinical and clinical trials  supplies  consulting expenses  facility costs and certain overhead costs 
in order to conduct research and development activities and compile regulatory submissions  we enter into contracts with vendors who render services over extended periods of time 
typically  we enter into three types of vendor contracts time based  patient based or a combination thereof 
under a time based contract  using critical factors contained within the contract  usually the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided  we record the contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which we estimate the service will be performed 
under a patient based contract  we first determine an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract  which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract 
we then record expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled during the period 
on a quarterly basis  we review the assumptions for each contract in order to reflect our most current estimate of the costs incurred under each contract 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
employee stock compensation we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas r  beginning january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  financial statements for periods prior to the adoption date are not adjusted for the change in accounting 
however  compensation expense is recognized  based on the requirements of sfas r  for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires us to make various judgments  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeiture rates 
in order to determine the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on treasury instruments whose term is consistent with the expected life of options 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our stock price volatility assumption is based on trends in both our current and historical volatilities of our stock and those of comparable companies 
we use the simplified method  as prescribed by the sec s sab no 
 to calculate the expected term of options 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of cancellations of share based compensation prior to vesting 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  we will record an adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
critical accounting policies and estimates applied to the restatement of epix s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our restated consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the amount of the recorded stock based compensation expense 
in certain instances the measurement date applied to an affected option grant was the date the grant was entered into our equity edge software system 
equity edge entry date in certain instances  the revised measurement date applied to an affected option grant was the date the grant was entered into our equity edge software system  which we used to monitor and administer our equity award programs from through present 
this methodology was used for certain option grants for which we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation confirming that the grant was approved on the 
table of contents indicated grant date  and where it could not be definitively determined when the grant actually had been approved 
when an option grant was entered into equity edge  the entry date was recorded by the system 
also  once option grants were entered into equity edge  individual grant information was generally printed and distributed to employees 
the equity edge entry date was used for two broad types of grants 
large grants for certain of the company s grants that were broad based  including those related to annual and mid year performance reviews  the evidence of the investigation supported a practice by the company of entering the grants into equity edge on a timely basis either at approval date or within a few business days 
although this was not the case for every large grant the company made  the company concluded that there is significant evidence of the company s timely entrance of these grants into equity edge soon after approval by the company s former chief executive officer 
the company believes  based on its analysis of all large grants  that for the large grants where the revised remeasurement date was the equity edge record added date  approval occurred on or around the date when grants were entered into equity edge 
as a result  the equity edge record added date serves as a close approximation of the measurement date 
had the company not used the equity edge record added date for such grants  but used either the date of the highest or lowest stock price during the period from the original grant date to the equity edge record added date  the total charge to operations would have been either a increase in expense of approximately  or an decrease in expense of approximately small grants for certain of the grants that were for limited numbers of employees  including promotion grants  there did not appear to be an observable consistent trend in the equity edge record added dates occurring soon after the grant approval date by the former chief executive officer for the small grants 
as such  the company has determined that  unlike the large grants  the equity edge record added dates were not in all cases a close approximation of the approval date for small grants 
however  we believe in most cases the equity edge entry date represents the earliest date when the terms of options to individual recipients are known with finality where the date of grant approval could not otherwise be determined by reference to the information available to us 
had the company not used the equity edge record added date for such grants  but used either the date of the highest or lowest stock price during the period from the original grant date to the equity edge record added date  the total charge to operations would have been either a increase in expense of approximately  or an decrease in expense of approximately with respect to option grants for which we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation corroborating that the grant date reflected in the approval documents was in fact the actual date of grant approval  we also considered using the indicated grant date as the measurement date under apb although this approach would have resulted in a substantially lower stock based compensation adjustment as compared to the methodology we used  we were not able to conclude that the indicated grant date represented the best approximation of the date the terms of the option were determined with finality 
re pricing of stock options for situations in which stock options were approved by the compensation committee and the stock option price used for the grant was selected after such approval by certain employees  including former members of our senior management  the accounting treatment for these options was to deem this selection of the price by certain employees  including former members of our senior management to be a re pricing for financial accounting purposes 
based upon the weight of the evidence obtained during the stock option investigation  the approval by the compensation committee members was deemed to be the measurement date for the grants as the compensation committee members had determined the number of shares to be granted  the recipients of the awards  and the related vesting provisions and believed the option grant would be granted on the closing price on the day the committee approved such grant 
the approximately million options granted on six different grant dates that were treated as re pricings for accounting purposes resulted in our accounting for these awards as variable awards 
all variable awards are remeasured on a quarterly basis to adjust the grants value to the intrinsic value at the end of the reporting period until such option is exercised or canceled 

table of contents results of operations research and development overview research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development activities  fees paid to contract research organizations to manage and monitor clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre clinical studies  fees paid to access chemical and intellectual property databases  costs of materials used in research and development and clinical studies  academic testing and consulting  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and costs of facilities and equipment  including depreciation  used in research and development activities 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expense to increase significantly excluding acquired in process research and development as a result of the merger with predix as we continue to expand our pipeline of drug candidates and to advance our existing drug candidates through the clinical trial process 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future pre clinical and clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test drug candidates in pre clinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we then conduct early stage clinical trials for each drug candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we currently have one imaging product  vasovist  which is currently approved for marketing in the european union  canada  iceland  norway  switzerland and australia 
we are currently appealing the us food and drug administration s fda decision to require additional clinical trials for approval of vasovist in the united states 
we also have one imaging agent  ep r  in clinical development 
we completed a phase a clinical trial of ep r in the second quarter of we do not intend to continue development of ep r and are actively pursuing a partner to continue further development 
future costs expected to be incurred for vasovist are currently limited to legal and consulting costs related to the on going fda appeal 
future costs expected to be incurred for ep are limited to consulting costs related to our partnering efforts 
in connection with our acquisition of predix  we incurred a charge of million for in process research and development the in process research and development charge represents the fair value of purchased in process technology of predix for research projects that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
this is a non recurring charge 
the in process research and development primarily represents the estimated fair value of the following drug candidates prx million that  as of the date of the merger  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  prx million that  as of the date of the merger had completed phase clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered phase clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with copd  and prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered phase clinical trials for the treatment of obesity 
in september we completed a pivotal phase clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with prx results from this trial demonstrated that prx did not achieve a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary endpoint of efficacy with respect to generalized anxiety disorder at the dose tested mg once daily 
the trial was statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of prx compared to placebo as measured by the change from baseline in the hamilton rating scale for anxiety or ham a 
the ham a scale is the accepted standard for the evaluation of anti anxiety drug activity 
table of contents by the fda 
effects of prx on symptoms of depression  which was a secondary endpoint of the phase clinical trial  were assessed using the montgomery asberg depression rating scale or madrs  an fda recommended assessment for depression 
the data from this trial showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline with prx treatment compared to placebo in the madras score  indicating that prx reduced symptoms of depression present in the patients in this trial 
in this phase trial  prx was well tolerated  and the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was very low with prx vs 
with placebo 
to date  there have been no serious adverse events associated with treatment in more than subjects who have received prx based on the phase trial results  we have discontinued clinical development of prx at a dose of mg once daily in generalized anxiety disorder 
we are currently focusing our development efforts for this drug candidate on depression 
we initiated a randomized  blinded phase clinical trial of prx in major depression in march the following summarizes the applicable disease indication and the clinical status of active program therapeutic drug candidates drug candidate disease indication clinical trial status prx pah copd phase a prx depression phase b prx alzheimer s disease phase a prx obesity cognitive impairment phase b completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary substantially according to a number of factors  including the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials  and therefore the amount and timing of our capital requirements  may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate 
we could incur increased clinical development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
in addition  we face significant uncertainty with respect to our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with respect to our drug candidates 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult to estimate the cost and length of a clinical trial 
we are unable to accurately and meaningfully estimate the cost to bring a product to market due to the variability in length of time to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines  but delays can occur for many reasons including those set forth above clinical estimate phase objective completion period phase establish safety in healthy volunteers and occasionally in patients  study how the drug works  is metabolized and interacts with other drugs years phase evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase further evaluate efficacy and safety of the drug candidate in a larger patient population years 
table of contents if we successfully complete phase clinical trials of a drug candidate  we intend to submit the results of all of the clinical trials for such drug candidate to the fda to support regulatory approval 
even if any of our drug candidates receive regulatory approval  we may still be required to perform lengthy and costly post marketing studies 
a major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization of our drug candidates is the ability to confirm safety and efficacy based on the data of long term clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals or will be successfully commercialized 
in order to achieve marketing approval  the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that our clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates 
if our clinical stage drug candidates are not successfully developed  future results of operations may be adversely affected 
we do not budget or manage our research and development costs by project on a fully allocated basis 
consequently  fully loaded research and development costs by project are not available 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  and many of our costs are not attributable to an individually named project but are directed to broadly applicable research projects 
as a result  we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our clinical and pre clinical projects on a project by project basis 
we estimates that  from the date we acquired predix  august  through december   the total payments we made to third parties for pre clinical study support  clinical supplies and clinical trials associated with prx  prx  prx and prx are as follows prx million prx million prx million prx million as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
financial results years ended december  and revenues the following table presents revenue and revenue growth decline for the years ended december   and years ended december  increase increase revenue decrease revenue decrease revenue product development revenue royalty revenue license fee revenue total our revenues in and have arisen principally from our collaboration agreements with bayer schering pharma ag  germany for vasovist  ep r and mri discovery research and cystic foundation therapeutics foundation cfft  from license fee revenues relating to our agreements with amgen  glaxosmithkline  bayer schering pharma ag  germany  cfft  tyco and bracco  and from royalties related to our agreements with bracco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
our mri discovery research collaboration with bayer schering pharma ag  germany concluded in may and our development agreement for ep r with schering concluded in august 
table of contents product development revenue decreased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the completion of the mri discovery research program in may and the ep r program in august  and the completion of the clinical trials for vasovist 
this decrease was partially offset by revenue of approximately million from the cfft program 
the decrease in royalty revenue of for the year ended december  compared to the prior year resulted from a reduction in the royalty rate on sales of multihance by bracco once total qualified sales of multihance exceeded a level established in the agreement and lower overall royalty eligible sales due to expiration of certain patents related to the sublicense with bracco 
due to the continuing expiration of patents  we expect royalty revenue from bracco to end in the first quarter of royalties from sales of vasovist in europe  which were first received in the third quarter of  were less than million but are expected to gradually increase as the product is introduced in additional markets where it has been approved 
license fee revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue from the amgen and glaxosmithkline agreements 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in revenue from the recognition of the bracco license fee as this fee was fully recognized by june royalty expenses royalty expenses of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of approximately million from the prior year 
the increase in royalty expenses during is primarily due to the royalty payment made to ramot at tel aviv university ltd 
resulting from the payments we received from glaxosmithkline in december relating to our agreement with them 
in connection with the execution of the glaxosmithkline agreement we received an up front payment and proceeds from an equity investment in our stock 
we paid ramot a royalty of approximately million relating to the glaxosmithkline up front payment 
all of our current clinical stage therapeutic drug candidates  prx  prx  prx and prx  were  at least in part  identified  characterized or developed using the licensed technology  and we would be required to make payments to ramot  as described below  as and when rights to any such drug candidates are ever sublicensed or any such drug candidates are commercialized 
in addition  we have used the licensed technology in all of our preclinical stage programs  and would expect to make payments to ramot if rights to any drug candidates were ever commercialized from any of these programs 
as such  we expect royalty expenses to increase significantly as we receive payments under our existing and future partnership agreements covering these programs 
we also are required to share between and of the consideration we receive from parties to whom we grant sublicenses of rights in the ramot technology or sublicenses of rights in products identified  characterized or developed with the use of such technology and between and of consideration we receive from performing services using such technology 
we would also be required to pay ramot royalties on sales of products developed with the use of such technology 
research and development expenses research and development expenses of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase from the prior year 
the increase in research and development expenses during is primarily due to external expenses of million associated with the clinical development programs as well as costs for the pre clinical programs and internal costs which began after the predix acquisition was completed on august  in connection with the predix acquisition  we shifted our focus away from the discovery and development of imaging agents to the discovery and development of therapeutics 
at the time of the merger  predix had four drug candidates in the clinic 
clinical program costs incurred since the acquisition included completion of a phase clinical trial for generalized anxiety disorder gad with prx  costs incurred for the completion of the phase i clinical trial and ongoing phase a clinical trial of prx for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  costs incurred for the ongoing phase a clinical trial of prx for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
table of contents copd  and costs incurred for completion of a single ascending dose clinical trial and the cost of the ongoing phase multiple ascending dose clinical trial of prx for the treatment of obesity and cognitive impairment 
in addition  we recognized non cash expense of approximately million resulting from our recognition of stock compensation related to the implementation of sfas r in as compared to a credit of million in based on the accounting for stock compensation under apb the credit in was primarily due to a reduction in expense for options that were subject to variable accounting as our stock price declined during as compared to in addition  in the third quarter of we recorded a charge of approximately million for our obligation under the settlement agreement reached with dr 
prince in to provide him with vasovist product for the life of the agreement 
the increased costs in as described above were partially offset by lower levels of spending on our vasovist and ep r development programs and from lower expenditures on our mri research programs 
in addition  we are no longer conducting pre clinical or clinical studies on any imaging product candidates 
spending during for vasovist primarily involved legal and consulting costs related to our appeal to the fda 
in addition  we completed a phase clinical trial for ep r the third quarter of and completed work on our mri discovery program in the second quarter of we do not intend to continue development of ep r and are actively pursuing a partner to continue further development 
in process research and development charge in connection with our acquisition of predix  we incurred a charge of million for in process research and development the in process research and development charge represents the fair value of purchased in process technology of predix for research projects that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
this is a non recurring charge 
the in process research and development primarily represents the fair value of the following drug candidates prx million that  as of the date of the merger  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of gad  prx million that  as of the date of the merger had completed phase clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered phase clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with copd  and prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered phase clinical trials for the treatment of obesity 
we anticipate that we will continue to spend a significant portion of our research and development budget on advancing these four drug candidates through additional clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to increased costs associated with the increase in personnel and infrastructure relating to the predix business that was acquired on august  in addition  legal expenses for patent related matters and general corporate items increased due to the increasing complexity of the post merger entity 
in addition  we recognized non cash expense of approximately million resulting from our recognition of stock compensation related to the implementation of sfas r as compared to a credit of million in based on the accounting for stock compensation under apb the credit in was primarily due to a reduction in expense for options that were subject to variable accounting as our stock price declined during as compared to in the first quarter of we expect to incur approximately million of legal and accounting fees associated with the stock option review 
restructuring costs restructuring costs amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs incurred in related to severance and benefits relating to the reduction in force 
in december  we reduced our workforce by employees  or approximately  in response to the fda s second approvable letter regarding vasovist 
the reductions  which were completed in january  affected both the research and development and the general and administrative areas of the company 
the costs included approximately related to the restructuring plan for additional 
table of contents severance costs as well as costs related to vacating certain leased space and the write off of leasehold improvements 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million for facility exit costs related to the consolidation of our cambridge  ma headquarters into the former predix headquarters in lexington  ma 
these costs primarily consist of future lease payments through the end of and the write off of leasehold improvements 
additional restructuring costs are expected to be incurred in for the consolidation of our leased laboratory facility in cambridge to our lexington location 
the timing and amount of the additional restructuring costs will depend upon the completion of laboratory construction at our lexington facility  which is currently anticipated to be in mid interest income and interest expense interest income of million for the twelve months ended december   represents an increase of from the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates on our invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during the period 
interest expense of million for the year ended december   represents an increase of from the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of million of interest related to the million milestone payment due to the former predix stockholders on october  the interest expense on the milestone primarily represents the increase in value from the date of acquisition of the embedded derivative included in the merger consideration payable which provides for the milestone payment to be paid in shares of our common stock based on of the day average closing price of our common stock ending on the trading day that is ten days prior to the payment date 
this embedded derivative is recorded at its fair value and changes in the fair value are recorded as interest expense 
under the terms of the merger agreement  if the milestone cannot be paid in shares of our common stock due to terms of the agreement  the payment plus interest will be made in cash 
the increase in interest expense in was partially offset by lower interest expense on our prior loan facility with bayer schering pharma ag  germany as that facility was terminated by both parties in january provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents italian income taxes related to the bracco agreement 
the amounts represent italian income taxes required to be withheld on bracco royalties for multihance sales 
we expect to have italian income taxes withheld on bracco royalties for the remainder of the agreement  which will end in early years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
revenues for consisted of million for product development revenue from bayer schering pharma ag  germany  million for royalty revenue related to the bracco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany agreements and million for license fee revenue related to the bayer schering pharma ag  germany  tyco and bracco agreements 
the decrease in total revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributed to lower product development and license fee revenues  partly offset by higher royalty revenue 
the lower product development revenue accounted for million of the decrease between the two periods and resulted from i revenue adjustments related to the overall increases in the costs and timeline to complete the ep r development program that were directly attributed to amending our phase ii proof of concept clinical trial protocols for ep r to include additional patient safety monitoring  ii lower costs incurred in compared to for the ep r development program resulting in lower recognition of revenue during  and iii lower reimbursable costs from bayer schering pharma ag  germany on the vasovist program 
the overall reduction in product development revenue related to the vasovist and ep r programs was partly offset by slightly higher revenue under the research collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
the increase in royalty revenue in was primarily attributed to the adjustment 
table of contents recorded by us at the end of to reflect bracco s revised determination of sales and its royalty overpayment assertion 
royalty revenue in included royalties from sales by bracco of multihance and bayer schering germany s sales of primovist 
the license fee revenue in was lower than in primarily because of a non repetitive bracco fda milestone that was recognized in and  to a lesser extent  changes made in to our estimate of the approval date for vasovist in the united states based on fda actions 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses in and primarily relate to development activities for vasovist and ep r and from our imaging discovery research programs 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the decrease in research and development expenses of million during the year ended december  resulted from lower spending for the vasovist and ep r development programs and lower stock based compensation expense of million  partly offset by higher spending for our mri and therapeutics research programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  benefits  outside professional services and related costs associated with our executive  finance and accounting  business development  marketing  human resources  legal and corporate communications activities  were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in spending of million by us resulted from lower marketing expenses related to vasovist and lower stock based compensation expense of million  which was partly offset by higher liability insurance premiums and higher corporate administration  primarily attributed to legal costs  combined with higher business development costs 
restructuring costs restructuring costs for the year ended december  were million as compared to for the year ended december  the restructuring costs related to planned actions taken by management to control costs and improve the focus of operations in order to reduce losses and conserve cash 
we announced a planned reduction in our workforce by employees  or approximately  in response to the fda s second approvable letter regarding vasovist 
the reductions  which were completed in january  affected both the research and development and the general and administrative areas of the company 
we reported a charge of approximately million for severance and related benefits as of december  substantially all payments related to the separation of employment were completed in the first quarter of interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during as a result of receipt of the net proceeds from the issuance of million convertible senior notes in june interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense of million for the year ended december  directly resulted from the issuance of convertible senior notes in june  partly offset by the reduction in the outstanding balance of interest bearing prepaid royalties from bracco and a reduction in interest expense resulting from management s decision not to drawdown the loan facility from bayer schering pharma ag  germany at the end of in january  we completed an agreement with bayer schering pharma ag  germany to terminate the loan facility

table of contents funding of ongoing operations and a net cash payment of million to former predix shareholders in connection with the merger with predix 
we used approximately million of cash to fund operating activities for year ended december   which compares to million to fund operations for the same period in the decrease in the cash used to fund operations in was primarily due to the receipt of million from glaxosmithkline in this increase in cash was partially offset by increased payments of accrued expenses in primarily related to the payment of accrued merger related liabilities that were assumed in the merger and a decrease in the contract advance account resulting from the offset of funds previously received from bayer schering pharma ag  germany for the vasovist  ep r and mri research programs 
our investing activities used million of cash during the year ended december  as compared to million of cash provided for the same period last year 
the primary uses of cash from investing activities in was the net cash paid of million in the predix merger as a result of the milestone payment of million less net cash acquired and the net purchase of marketable securities of million resulting from a strategy of purchasing an increasing amount of securities with a greater than three month maturity 
the primary source of cash from investing activities in was the net redemption of marketable securities of million which was partially offset by million of capital spending 
we generated million in cash from financing activities during the year ended december   which was attributable to million of common stock sold to glaxosmithkline partially offset by the payment of million of bridge loans assumed in the predix merger 
financing activities in used million in primarily from a net million repayment of the loan facility with bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
this loan facility was terminated in january our primary sources of cash include quarterly payments from cfft for research services  quarterly royalty payments from bracco from the sales of multihance and monthly interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities 
with the expiration in of certain patents related to the sublicense with bracco  we expect royalty payment from bracco to end in the first quarter of in the second half of  we began receiving royalty payments approximately  for from sales of vasovist by bayer schering pharma ag  germany following the commercial launch of the product in europe  which began on a country by country basis in the second quarter of we expect royalty payments from sales of vasovist to slowly increase as the product is introduced in other countries where it has been approved 
other potential cash inflows include milestone payments from our current strategic collaborators  glaxosmithkline  amgen  cfft and bayer schering pharma ag  germany  including a milestone payment of million from bayer schering pharma ag  germany  which is dependent on the fda s approval of vasovist 
known outflows  in addition to our ongoing research and development and general and administrative expenses  include the following million milestone payment to the former predix shareholders due on october  primarily payable in shares of our stock if certain conditions are met or otherwise payable in cash  interest on our million convertible notes at a rate of payable semi annually on june and december  semi annual royalties that we owe to mgh on sales by bracco of multihance  a milestone payment of million owed to tyco  which is dependent on the fda s approval of vasovist 
we estimate that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of december  and anticipated revenue we will earn in and  exclusive of any significant milestone payments or opt in fees  will fund our operations through our past stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements expose us to greater risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 
in the event of any litigation or regulatory proceeding involving a negative finding or assertion by the sec  us attorney  court of law or any third party claim related to our stock option practices  we may be liable for damages  fines or other civil or criminal remedies or remedial actions  or be required to further restate prior period financial statements or adjust current period financial statements 
in addition  considerable legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 

table of contents if holders of our convertible senior notes require redemption of the notes  we may be required to repay million  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events under the notes  which include a change of control of us or termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical and pre clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both us and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products  if any  gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing and new research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our potential products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending for the continued development of our pre clinical and clinical compounds  we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for at least the next several years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to government sponsored enterprises  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a change in the fair market value of our total portfolio of approximately  at december
