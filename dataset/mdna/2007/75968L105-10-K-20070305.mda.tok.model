item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview renaissance learning  inc is a leading provider of technology for personalizing reading  math  and writing practice for pre kindergarten through senior high pre k schools and districts 
our computerized assessment and progress monitoring tools accelerate learning and improve test scores by facilitating increased student practice of essential skills  helping educators motivate students  increasing the quality  quantity  and timeliness of performance data available to educators and providing student access to low cost computing solutions 
our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  computerized hardware products and related services 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of educational software and hardware 
revenue from sales of hardware are generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue recognition from sales of our software depends on whether the software is i off the shelf or customized and ii how it is licensed  ie  perpetual licence or subscription 
we recognize revenue from off the shelf perpetually licensed software sales upon shipment to customers 
subscription based software sales are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
sales of software that require substantial modification or customization are recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and deferred revenues from software that require substantial modification or customization are not significant in any of the years presented 
service revenue is primarily derived from i training seminars and conferences  ii software telephone support agreements  iii consulting services  iv technical services  v hosting and vi other remote services 
revenue from training seminars is recognized when the seminar or workshop is performed 
revenue from consulting and technical services is recognized as the services are performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
telephone support included with sales of perpetual software licenses has a duration of twelve months or less and is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from other product support agreements is initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  typically months 
deferred revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and services not yet performed  ii advance invoicing on contracts and iii that portion of product support agreements and subscription based product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
it is our practice to announce new products prior to when the products are ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in fluctuations in backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for training seminars are generally received from customers in advance of training events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive solution consisting of products and services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have higher revenue and higher revenue growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of our software and hardware products and the delivery of services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as our alphasmart laptops  optical mark card scanners  interactive response systems  educational products  training materials  manuals and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs and v other overhead costs 
we realize higher gross margins on our software product sales than on our hardware and service sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales  beginning when the product is available for general release  using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally estimated to be months 
acquisition and divestiture on june   we acquired alphasmart  inc  a provider of affordable  laptop computing solutions for k schools 
the results of alphasmart s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
alphasmart products are rugged  portable  easy to use  low total cost of ownership computing devices that can operate independently or complement existing computers 
models offered include the neo and dana 
alphasmart computing devices run curriculum specific software focused on skills improvement and real time formative assessment in writing  language arts  mathematics  science  keyboarding  social studies  technology literacy and special needs 
in addition  the devices perform word processing  function as a calculator  are expandable and feature advanced wireless capabilities  increasing student access to affordable portable computing 
the acquisition provides opportunities to achieve future long term synergies related to the complementary nature of alphasmart s hardware products and renaissance s software products 
alphasmart s products have the potential to run renaissance s software  thus enabling students greater access to our software where ready availability of computer access is currently a product use limitation 
in february  we consummated the sale of our generation subsidiary  a non core part of our business 
the results of generation  for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  are reflected as discontinued operations 
except as indicated  amounts referred to in this item relate to continuing operations 
results of operations our results of operations can be affected by many factors including the general economic environment  state and federal budgetary decisions and the length and complexity of the sales cycle for school districts 
revenue can be significantly impacted by the proportion of sales attributable to our subscription based product and service offerings relative to sales from non subscription based offerings  which can result in a portion of a period s sales being initially deferred and recognized as revenue in future periods over the subscription term 
we also believe our results of operations for were negatively impacted by transition activities and training needs related to a reorganization and expansion of our sales groups 
our renaissance place products are designed to meet the needs of entire school districts from a central server 
sales of products and services at a district level are more complex  have a longer sales cycle  and are typically for a larger dollar amount than sales made to individual schools 
thus  revenues from district sales can be more uneven and are more difficult to accurately predict 
consequently  our revenues and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the timing of large district orders 
since our renaissance place product and service offerings are typically sold on a subscription basis with a term of twelve months  a greater portion of our revenue is initially deferred and recognized into income over the subscription period 
this can cause our revenue to show a greater decline than it would have if these products had been sold as perpetual licenses  for which the revenue is recognized immediately upon shipment 
deferred revenue increased million and million  over the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in deferred revenue during was driven primarily by sales of subscription based enterprise software packages 
our net income and results of operations was impacted in by a million charge that was comprised of separation expenses  primarily for former executives 
other items that impacted were i the acquisition of alphasmart  ii the divestiture of generation  iii the sale of our madison  wisconsin office building and iv the tax benefit related to the settlement of certain state and federal tax positions in the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales  except that individual components of cost of sales and gross profit are shown as a percentage of their corresponding component of net sales for the years ended december  net sales products services total net sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit products services total gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative operating income other  net income continuing operations before income taxes income taxes continuing operations income continuing operations income discontinued operations net income years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales decreased by million or  to million in from million in revenues  excluding alphasmart laptops in both periods  declined by million or for the full year 
a significant portion of this decline was related to our customers transitioning their purchases to more subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader  as compared to last year 
revenues from subscription based products are initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the subscription period  generally one year  while the majority of revenues from non subscription based sales are recognized immediately upon delivery 
during  deferred revenue increased by million as compared to an increase of million in we believe that revenue excluding the impact of laptops is a useful metric for investors because it provides a basis upon which to compare the performance of our business  as it existed prior to the june  alphasmart acquisition  to earlier periods 
product revenue  including alphasmart in both periods  decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was driven by the transition to more subscription based sales discussed above and generally lower order rates which impacted most product lines  which were partially offset by the inclusion of alphasmart s results for the full year in as compared to a partial year in service revenue decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in service revenues were down due to decreased revenue from professional development services  primarily onsite events  which was partially offset by increases in remote services such as consulting and hosting 
revenue from onsite events was impacted in by reduced pricing as well as our increased emphasis on remote services 
for the past several years  including  we have held a national conference in the first quarter 
we will not be holding a national conference in  but instead will be hosting two new but smaller regional events in its place during the first quarter of cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products increased to in from in the product cost of sales percentage increased primarily due to a higher proportion of sales attributable to hardware in as compared to as we realize lower gross profit margins on hardware sales than on software sales 
the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in the higher cost of sales percentage is the result of personnel and infrastructure investments made in  and to reduced pricing of our onsite events 
our overall gross profit margin percentage decreased to in from in this resulted from the higher cost of sales percentages in  from both products and services  as discussed above 
product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses increased to in from in we capitalized product development expenses of  in compared to  in product development spending was higher in due to the inclusion of alphasmart for the full year as compared to only a partial year in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to our sales force expansion  partially offset by reduced marketing expenses as we focus on a more targeted direct marketing approach 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to i a million charge related to separation expenses  primarily for former executives  ii a million increase in share based compensation and iii the inclusion of alphasmart for a full year in as compared to a partial year in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs increased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from in due to the combined effect of the factors discussed above 
other income 
other income decreased million to million in from million in  primarily due to the sale of an office building which generated a million pre tax gain in income tax expense continuing operations 
income tax expense of million  from continuing operations  was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income  compared to million  or of pre tax income for in  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million related to the favorable resolution of certain state and federal tax positions  which was the primary reason for the point lower effective tax rate in discontinued operations 
in we realized a gain of approximately million on the sale of generation  which includes a one time tax benefit of million 
when combined with the operating losses incurred in january and february for that subsidiary  the net income from discontinued operations totaled approximately million in years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales increased by million or  to million in from million in the increase in sales is due to the inclusion of alphasmart revenues in the results of operations for partially offset by declines in other product and service offerings 
product sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in service revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in our service revenues grew over the prior year primarily driven by improvement in our newer service offerings such as guided implementation and installation services 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products increased to in from in the increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the impact in of the alphasmart hardware product sales which generate lower gross margins than our software sales 
the cost of sales of services decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services decreased to in from in the improved service margins are the result of i operating leverage in our newer service offerings for which we were ramping up costs ahead of revenue in and ii a more profitable national school renaissance conference 
our overall gross profit margin percentage decreased to in from in primarily driven by the increased cost of sales percentage on product sales as discussed above 
product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses increased to in from in product development expenses increased primarily due to the inclusion of alphasmart expenses in and in part to increases in product development expenditures related to new product offerings 
we capitalized product development expenses of  in compared to  in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were relatively unchanged at million in compared to million in we experienced lower selling and marketing expenses in the first half of than in due to comparatively lower levels of field sales personnel 
this was offset by higher expenses in the second half of due to the incremental inclusion of alphasmart s selling and marketing expenses in our results 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the inclusion of alphasmart expenses in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs increased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from in primarily due to the combined impact of the increased product development expenses and the lower gross margins related to the increased proportion of revenue from hardware sales which generate lower gross margins than our software sales 
other income 
other income increased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to the sale of our madison  wisconsin office building which generated a million pre tax gain in income tax expense continuing operations 
income tax expense of million  from continuing operations  was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income  compared to million  or of pre tax income for in  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million related to the favorable resolution of certain state and federal tax positions which was the primary reason for the point decrease in the effective tax rate 
discontinued operations 
we recorded a gain on the sale of generation of approximately million  including a one time tax benefit of million 
when combined with the operating losses incurred in january and february for that subsidiary  the net income from discontinued operations totaled approximately million in the net operating loss from generation in was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were million  down million from the december  total of million 
during  we generated operating cash flow of million and million in proceeds from a mortgage note  on our former facility in madison  wisconsin  that was prepaid to us in october at december   we had a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank which is available until may  the line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate based on the prime rate less  or a fixed rate for a period of up to days based on libor plus 
the rate is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank available until april  the line of credit bears interest based on the prime rate less 
as of december   the lines of credit had not been used 
on april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares under the stock repurchase program 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
repurchased shares will become treasury shares and will be used for stock based employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes 
during the period of january  through december   we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
since the original authorization in  we have repurchased million shares at a cost of million under this repurchase program 
depending on our stock valuation  cash availability and other factors  we may repurchase additional shares as a beneficial use of our cash to enhance shareholder value 
we declared a special cash dividend of per share on january   quarterly cash dividends of per share for each of the four quarters of and quarterly cash dividends of for each of the four quarters of and we intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends  subject to capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
we believe our strong cash position coupled with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations including contingent obligations  that would have a material effect on our financial results 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases  primarily for facilities that we occupy in order to carry out our business operations 
we utilize operating leases for some of our facilities to gain flexibility as compared to purchasing facilities outright and limit our exposure to many of the risks of owning commercial property  particularly with regard to international operations 
these agreements generally  are for terms of one to five years and cannot be terminated by either the lessor or us for reasons other than breach of the lease agreement 
we do not anticipate early termination of any of these agreements 
for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to these operating leases 
purchase obligations 
we enter into commitments with certain suppliers to purchase components for our hardware products  such as alphasmart computing devices  accelscan scanners and the know response system 
the majority of these obligations will be satisfied within one year 
as of december   our approximate contractual obligations for operating leases and purchase obligations by period due were as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total retirement plan 
we have established a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for the provision of retirement benefits to members of our senior management 
under the terms of the plan  participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and to hypothetically invest it in certain mutual fund investments 
upon a participant s retirement or certain other events  the company has an obligation to repay the participant s account balance  which is the net of the deferred compensation  a defined matching company contribution and the hypothetical market gain or loss of each participant s investment selections 
as of december   we have fully funded the million aggregate contractual obligation for future payments to serp participants 
the serp is more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
other obligations 
as of december   we did not hold any long term debt obligations  long term purchase obligations or material capital lease obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a list of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from our software products in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
under this accounting standard  revenue is recognized when the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for perpetually licensed off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii on the percentage of completion basis for software products which require significant customization or modification  iii as seminars are performed for training  iv straight line over the term of the support agreement for other software support agreements  v as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for technical and consulting services  and vi straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products 
accordingly  management is required to make judgments as to whether pricing is fixed and determinable  whether collectibility is reasonably assured and what the percentage of completion is as of the financial reporting date 
expenses are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements 
we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns or doubtful accounts to differ from historical experience 
changes in such allowances may be required if future returns or bad debt activity differs from our estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
management uses judgment when applying impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
examples of factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that impact the value of an asset 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimating fair value requires that we forecast future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
changes to these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
software support and product warranty obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of software support and hardware warranties at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based upon our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in the cost of providing telephone support and product return rates 
if the actual costs of fulfilling these obligations differ from our estimates  it could result in additional charges to cost of sales in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  the estimated amount of certain tax credits  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations  if the actual amount of tax credits varies from our estimates  or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation provides specific guidance on how enterprises recognize and measure tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for us on january  we have evaluated fin and have determined that its adoption will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and ii the decrease or increase in value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuer and from changes in general market conditions 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with our corporate investment policy as established by our board of directors 
the goals of the policy are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
our investment policy permits investments in obligations of the us treasury department and its agencies  money market funds  and high quality investment grade corporate and municipal interest bearing obligations 
the policy requires diversification to prevent excess concentration of issuer risk and requires the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels 
the policy precludes investment in equity securities except for the specific purpose of funding the obligations related to our supplemental executive retirement plan see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our investment securities had a market value of approximately million and a carrying value of million 
due to the type and duration of our investments we do not expect to realize any material gains or losses related to market risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  and indian rupee 
at this time  foreign exchange rate risk is not significant due to the relative size of our foreign operations and revenues derived from sales in foreign currency
