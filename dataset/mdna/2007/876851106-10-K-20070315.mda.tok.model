table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of banking services to our customers  with a primary focus on serving closely held businesses in the chicago metropolitan area and the people who own and manage them 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted common share  compared with million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the increased net income was primarily a result of the reversal of accrued income tax liabilities totaling million  or per diluted common share  relating to tax uncertainties in prior years 
these tax benefits were recognized in the second half of because of the expiration of the statute of limitations on our income tax return and the completion of certain taxing authority examinations 
pre tax income decreased million  or  during to million compared to million during the decrease in pre tax income was largely due to an increase in noninterest expense of million  or  and decrease in noninterest income of million  or 
these decreases in pre tax income were partly offset by higher net interest income of million  or 
total assets increased by million  or  from year end to billion at december  we reported net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted common share  compared with million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the increased net income applicable to common stockholders was primarily a result of higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan losses  while lower noninterest income was substantially offset by lower noninterest expense 
in addition  we had no preferred dividends in because we redeemed all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock in july net interest income increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared with the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for total assets increased by million  or  from year end to billion at december  capital transactions on august   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
on september   we issued an additional  shares in connection with an over allotment option granted to our underwriters 
we received million  after offering expenses  from this offering 
the offering helped increase our tangible equity to assets ratio and has had the effect of increasing the daily trading volume of our common stock 
we used million of the proceeds to reduce notes payable and the remainder of the proceeds have been retained at the holding company to support our continued growth 
in connection with our capital stock offering  the taylor family reduced their stock holdings in the company by selling  shares of common stock in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the taylor family 
as a result of the taylor family s sale of stock  the taylor family s ownership of the company has declined below 

table of contents on june   tayc capital trust ii  our wholly owned non consolidated subsidiary  issued million of trust preferred securities in a private placement 
tayc capital trust ii invested the proceeds  along with million received from us for the purchase of its common equity securities  in million of junior subordinated debentures issued by the company 
on july   we used the proceeds from the junior subordinated debentures to redeem all of our outstanding shares of series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the redemption price was the stated liquidation value of the series a preferred stock of per share  totaling million  plus  of accrued and unpaid dividends since the last dividend distribution date 
the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures after issuance costs and redemption of the series a preferred stock were used for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
our accounting policies are described in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and an unallocated allowance 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
the significant uncertainties surrounding our portfolio of borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments and competitive challenges as well as management and other changes greatly complicate the estimate of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 

table of contents as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
goodwill impairment we have goodwill of million that we recognized in connection with our acquisition of the bank 
we test this goodwill annually on july for impairment  or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of july  and we determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
the evaluation for impairment includes comparing the estimated fair market value of the bank to our carrying value for the bank 
because there is not a readily observable market value for the bank  the estimation of the fair market value is based on the market price of our common stock adjusted for the junior subordinated debentures and the notes payable at the holding company level 
income taxes at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves is reasonable 
a reserve is utilized or reversed once the applicable statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
it is likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and floor and collar agreements  to assist in our interest rate risk management 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of the hedge and quarterly thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivative flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 

table of contents the estimates of fair values of our derivatives are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate mid market valuations 
the fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and therefore can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in income statement volatility 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets  including investment securities and loans  and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million during these non gaap tax equivalent measures are discussed more fully below 
the net interest income increased as a result of higher average interest earning assets  partly offset by a decline in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during compared to during  a decrease of basis points 
the margin in was negatively impacted by competitive pricing pressure for loans and deposits  as well as changes in our earning asset and funding mix in as compared to the tax equivalent net interest spread  which is determined by subtracting the yield on interest earning assets from the cost of interest bearing liabilities  declined basis points during to compared to in while our yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to during from during  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased to a greater extent 
the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion for compared to billion for average loans increased million  or  to billion during compared to billion for average commercial loans accounted for most of the increase  as these balances increased million  or  between the two periods 
our portfolio of home equity and consumer loans decreased by million  or 
the yield earned on our loan portfolios benefited from the rising interest rate environment and the increase in the prime lending rate from june to june however  we experienced a decline in the interest rate spread above the prime lending rate on our prime based loans due to competitive pressures within our marketplace 
in addition  our investment portfolio was larger in and the yield on our investment securities is generally lower than the yield on our loans 
average investment balances increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the growth in average earning assets during was funded primarily with interest bearing deposits 
average interest bearing deposits balances were billion during  a million  or increase from average interest bearing deposit balances of billion in during  average money market balances increased million  or  and average brokered certificates of deposits cds increased million  or 
while these balances increased  the balances of our lower cost deposits  such as now accounts  savings accounts  and non interest bearing deposits  all decreased 
the shift in balances towards the higher rate deposit products contributed to the downward pressure on our net interest margin during see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned deposits below for further discussion on changes in deposit balances during 
table of contents we believe  based on our internal modeling using our balance sheet as of december   that our net interest margin would likely decline over the next year if our balance sheet remained static and there were no further increases in prevailing market interest rates  including the prime lending rate that we use for many of our loans 
our net interest margin would be subject to downward pressure as more of our interest bearing liabilities would reprice to current rates  while the yield on our interest earning assets largely reflects current rates 
additional factors  including those described above that negatively impacted the net interest margin  may put additional pressure on our net interest margin in see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on the impact of changes in interest rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million during the net interest income increased as a result of the increase in our average interest earning assets and in our net interest margin 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during compared to during our net interest margin benefited from the increase in market interest rates that began at the end of the second quarter of the net interest margin incorporates the impact on noninterest bearing funds 
because the average volume of earning assets was million greater than the volume of interest bearing liabilities and the yield on earning assets increased during  the net interest margin increased 
the tax equivalent net interest spread was unchanged at during both and the yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to during from during the cost of our interest bearing liabilities also increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion for compared to billion for average loans increased million  or  to billion during compared to billion for average commercial loans increased million  or  between the two periods  while our portfolio of home equity and consumer loans decreased by million  or 
the million increase in average earning assets from to was funded primarily with the million increase in deposits 
from to  average brokered and out of local market cds increased million  or  average money market accounts increased million  or  and average local customer cds increased million  or 
deposits in noninterest bearing and lower rate products  including now and savings accounts  declined 
tax equivalent measures 
as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments

our service charges are principally derived from deposit accounts 
service charges totaled million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
service charge income is impacted by a number of factors  including the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the decrease in service charge revenue over the last two years was primarily caused by a lower volume of deposit services rendered and an increase in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances to offset gross activity charges 
trust fees declined  or  to million in as compared to and declined million  or  in as compared to the decline in trust fees was a result of our discontinuation of certain trust services during  including the sale of our land trust operations during the first quarter of and the discontinuation of tax deferred exchange trust services during the fourth quarter of trust fees in were primarily from our offering of corporate trust services

in addition to selling the land and building  we sold approximately million of deposit balances and million of loans associated with the branch 
loan syndication fees totaled million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
these fees were earned through the syndication of certain commercial real estate development loans for our customers 
while we have earned syndication fees in each of the last three years  that opportunity is dependent on the level of activity in the real estate development market as well as our decisions with respect to balance sheet and credit capacity 
atm fees have declined since as the number of automatic teller machines we have deployed in our market has decreased 
we have investments in limited partnerships that specialize in providing low income housing in the chicago metropolitan area 
we account for our limited partnership investments under the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of partnership losses in noninterest income and the related low income housing tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense

total salaries and benefits in increased million  or  as compared to  as an increase in incentive compensation was partly offset by lower base salaries 
salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in the increase in base salaries during was primarily caused by our increased investment in our relationship and sales managers 
the reduction in base salaries from the decrease in the number of trust employees  was largely offset by higher medical insurance expense 
salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance decreased  or  to million in  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of lower severance expense and fewer employees in severance expense was  in   in and million in the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of compared to at the end of 
table of contents total incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in we reduced our accruals for cash based incentives for because certain performance targets were not achieved 
this decrease was partly offset by a million increase in cost of equity based compensation  primarily due to the adoption of new accounting requirements in that require the recognition of expense related to stock options granted to employees and directors 
compensation costs in included  of costs related to stock options 
beginning in  salaries and employee benefits expense was impacted by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 share based payment sfas r  which revised and reissued guidance on the accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r eliminated the intrinsic value method that we previously used to account for the granting of employee stock options 
we adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective method  recording compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remained outstanding at the date of adoption 
stock based compensation expense  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized against earnings for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated using a black scholes pricing model

table of contents operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services

investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to provide a source of income with minimal risk of loss  a source of liquidity and interest rate risk management opportunities 
in managing our investment portfolio within the composition of the entire balance sheet  we balance our earnings  credit  interest rate risk  and liquidity considerations  with a goal of maximizing longer term overall profitability

we consider our commercial loan portfolio to be our primary earning asset and use our investment portfolio primarily for liquidity and interest rate risk management 
our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to million at december  compared to million at year end we increased our investment portfolio during the first quarter of for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes 
in  we purchased million of mortgage related securities and million of tax exempt municipal securities 
the mortgage related securities were purchased at discounts to par and had an average life of approximately years 
the tax exempt municipal securities had average lives to the par call date of years 
the weighted average life of the investment portfolio was approximately five years at both december  and in connection with our liquidity risk management  we regularly assess the size of our investment portfolio to meet our liquidity needs 
see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned liquidity and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on liquidity and interest rate risk management 
the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio was million at the end of compared to an unrealized loss of million at the end of the unrealized loss is due to changes in market interest rates and not credit deterioration 
we manage our potential exposure to impairment within our investment securities portfolio by limiting the purchase of securities at a premium over par value and by subjecting all 
table of contents securities to interest rate shock testing prior to their acquisition 
no security is purchased if the result of the interest rate shock testing indicates a negative yield could result under any of the rate shocks 
in addition  we adjust premium amortization monthly based on current prepayment estimates and month rolling actual prepayment rates for all mortgage related securities 
at december   we had investment securities in an unrealized loss position 
of these securities  securities have been in a loss position for twelve months or more 
we believe that none of these unrealized losses represented other than temporary impairments of our investment portfolio 
we have both the intent and ability to hold all of these securities for the time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
our investment portfolio increased by million  or  to million at december  compared to million at year end during  we purchased approximately million in securities to replace maturities  sales and other cash flows from our existing securities portfolio 
in addition  beginning in september  we purchased million in securities as part of an interest rate risk management strategy to reduce potential exposure to declining interest rates

investments in us treasury securities and us government agency securities are generally considered to have low credit risk 
our mortgage backed securities holdings consist principally of direct pass through securities issued by the fannie mae and freddie mac 
these securities are also considered to have low credit risk  but do possess market value risk due to the prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
our cmos consist primarily of planned amortization class securities that are backed by fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
although cmos are guaranteed as to principal and interest by certain agencies  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac  they possess market risk due to the prepayment risk associated with the underlying collateral 
we generally invest in state and municipal obligations that are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating organizations 
however  certain municipal issues  which are restricted to our local market area  are not rated and undergo the bank s standard underwriting procedures for loan transactions 
we also have investments in federal reserve bank stock and fhlb stock which are required to be maintained for various purposes 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities  that exceeded of stockholders equity

consumer oriented loan products totaled million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
consumer loans have continued to decline as we discontinued origination of indirect auto and manufactured homes  de emphasized first mortgage products  and ceased acquiring home equity loans and lines from mortgage brokers 
commercial and industrial c i loans consist of loans to businesses or for business purposes that are either unsecured or secured by collateral other than the business real estate

a slowing real estate market is expected to continue to impact the growth in our commercial real estate and construction portfolios 
our portfolio of residential real estate mortgages continues to modestly decline as a result of our decision to de emphasize this product in at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
correspondingly  this portfolio has represented approximately of our total loan portfolio over the past three years 
while we do not actively seek to originate new home mortgage loans in the general chicagoland market  we do offer these products to our current customers  particularly to our business owner customers 
our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit also continues to decline as a result of our decision to discontinue the origination of third party sourced home equity products in at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million and million at december  and respectively 
correspondingly  this portfolio as a percentage of total loans decreased to at year end from at december  the percentage of our home equity loans and lines that exceed of the appraised value of the underlying real estate  after giving effect to any outstanding first mortgage loans  was at december  as compared to at year end the bank s general underwriting guidelines do not allow lines in excess of of appraised value

demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december  nonperforming assets and impaired loans our lending officers and their managers are responsible for the ongoing review of present and projected future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  an objective loan review process independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level 
the committee evaluates whether to place the loan on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
all loans past due days or more are evaluated to determine if the accrual of interest should be discontinued 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis for recognition of interest income when sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest 
generally  loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when principal and interest is contractually past due days  unless the loan committee determines that the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets restructured loans not included in nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets our nonperforming loans increased to their highest year end level in five years at december  the increase in nonperforming loans occurred primarily among loans for residential land development 
we believe the decline in residential home sales in the chicagoland market that began in has reduced demand for developed residential lots and vacant land and  as a result  has reduced cash inflows for many residential developers 
where there is reduced demand for new homes  residential developers may be required to hold land for longer periods of time which can lead to greater interest cost and lower or deferred cash flows 
these factors may result in higher credit risk for the lender 
we viewed the increase in our nonperforming loans as an indicator of increased credit risk in our loan portfolio in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming loans at december  included million of loans to two borrowers  both of whom were residential real estate developers 
loans totaling million to one of these borrowers were placed on nonaccrual status at the end of the second quarter in loans to a second borrower totaling million include one loan placed on nonaccrual status at year end and the other reported as days or more past due but still accruing interest 
the inability of a borrower to comply with the terms of a loan agreement often requires the loan to be recognized as contractually past due  and therefore  reported as nonperforming 
however  not all nonperforming loans are considered impaired loans 
a loan may be contractually past due with respect to its note maturity date but current on interest or otherwise performing such that we believe that it is probable that interest and principal will be paid in full 
a loan is considered impaired if  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we regard all nonaccrual loans as impaired  as well as those accruing loans that we believe to have higher risk of noncompliance with the contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
once we determine that a loan has been impaired  we then determine what we believe is the likely amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  our impairment analysis may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
generally  the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate 
however  collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 

table of contents information about our impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  at end of year average balance of impaired loans for the year interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year certain categories of loans that are more homogenous  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment 
therefore  we do not assign individual credit risk ratings to these loans and they are excluded from impaired loans 
the dollar amount of impaired loans can vary from period to period depending upon the size and number of loans deemed impaired 
total impaired loans were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  in addition to nonperforming and impaired loans  we also monitor performing loans where appropriate 
at december   a greater portion of the performing loans that we were actively monitoring were to residential development borrowers than in prior years 
diminished demand in the residential housing market may reveal specific project or borrower weaknesses that otherwise might have been mitigated by a stronger or more vibrant market 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial  which includes c i  commercial real estate  and real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification and in some cases by delinquency status 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans over loan to value  home equity loans equal to or less than  and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for 
table of contents other relevant factors affecting the segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during in comparison  net charge offs totaled million  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  during the allowance as a percentage of total loans has declined from at december  to at december  the reduced net charge off experience over the past two years favorably impacted our estimates of probable losses inherent in our portfolio at december  as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses

we will move our employees that are currently located at our west washington location in downtown chicago to the new space when the west washington lease expires in december however  we plan to continue to maintain the banking center on the first floor of the existing west washington location 
we expect to incur expenditures for the leasehold improvements  furniture  and equipment associated with the build out of the new space

a significant portion of the increase in money market accounts resulted from an increase in higher rate market priced money market balances 
our in market money market deposits include deposits from what we describe as deposit rich customers 
these customers include title companies  downstream correspondent banks and a tax deferred exchange company  among others 
within this customer group  there were three customers with combined deposit balances of million at december  on january   we completed the sale of our broadview banking center 
in addition to selling the physical land and building  we sold approximately million of deposits 
the deposits sold consisted of million of noninterest bearing demand deposits  million of interest bearing demand deposits and million of cds 
the sale of these deposits did not have a material impact on our funding 
we utilize out of market cd s to fund the portion of our earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
while these time deposits generally carry higher interest rates  prudent use of these alternatives is part of our strategy for the management of our overall cost of funding 
when we evaluate the rate paid on a particular in market deposit product  we quantify the cost of the increase and weigh it against the alternative of maintaining the rate and exposing ourselves to potential balance runoff  which then must be funded through alternative sources 
this in market deposit pricing strategy has been critical for us in the management of our cost of total funding 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts of  or less as the purchasers seek to

we also issue brokered cds 
the balance of our brokered cds was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may fund brokered cds without prior regulatory approval  and the bank is currently categorized as well capitalized 
adverse operating results at the bank or changes in industry conditions or overall market liquidity could lead to our inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which could result in higher costs to  or reduced asset levels at  the bank 
in addition  brokered money market deposits were augmented by a new funding source in total brokered money market balances were million at december  brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and the remaining unamortized fair value adjustments that resulted from the termination of interest rate exchange agreements that were associated with brokered cds previously accounted for as fair value hedges

we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by extending and laddering the maturity of these liabilities and pledging collateral 
we manage the risk associated with volatility in our customers deposit balances by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
for example  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
under this program  at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral with a lendable value of million

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we 
table of contents had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
historically  approximately of available consumer and commercial loan commitment amounts are drawn 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees

we have used interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  and interest rate floors and collars to manage the interest rate risk associated with our commercial loan portfolio and our portfolio of fixed rate brokered cds 
at both december  and  we had two interest rate floors  each with a million notional amount 
these agreements  which are scheduled to mature in  are based upon the prime lending rate and 
table of contents have interest rate floors of and 
we use these interest rate floors to help manage interest rate risk associated with certain commercial loans that are tied to the prime lending rate by protecting interest income in the event that the prime lending rate declines below the floor level 
the company did not receive any payments in or from these floors 
during  both of the floors were designed as cash flow hedges 
as a result  the change in the fair value of the derivative is reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
during  we removed the hedge designation on the floor 
therefore   of change in the fair value of derivative subsequent to its de designation was reported directly in noninterest income in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  since we removed the hedge designation  the prior balance in accumulated other comprehensive income  which was comprised of the change in fair value since inception less amortization of the original floor cost  net of tax  is being amortized to loan interest income over the remaining four year term of the floor 
during   of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income was reclassified as a reduction in loan interest income and  of the remaining balance is expected to be reclassified in the floor remains classified as a cash flow hedge 
the premium on this floor is amortized to loan interest income in proportion to the expected value of the floor  calculated at inception  in each of the future periods 
during  loan interest income was reduced by  for amortization of the floor premium  and  of amortization is expected for during  we entered into two interest rate collar agreements  each with a notional amount of million  to hedge the variability in cash flow on certain prime based commercial loans

the interest rate swap was scheduled to mature in the million cost to terminate the swap was deferred and is being amortized against loan interest income over what would have been the remaining life of the swap 
during   of this deferred loss was amortized as a reduction in loan interest income and the remaining  of the deferred loss will be amortized in in may  we terminated all of our interest rate swaps that had been used as fair value hedges against brokered cds cd swaps 
the notional amount of these terminated swaps was million 
at december   we had million notional amount of these cd swaps outstanding 
the termination of the swaps resulted in a  charge that was recorded in other derivative expense included in noninterest income 
the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged brokered cds at the time of termination  which was million  will be amortized into deposit interest expense over the remaining life of the related brokered cds using an effective yield method 
during   of this fair value adjustment was amortized as additional deposit interest expense  and  of this adjustment is expected to be amortized in during  we entered into swaps with a total notional amount of million  to hedge the variability of cash flows of certain prime indexed commercial loans and accounted for these transactions as cash flow hedges

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors and collars  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts are designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
net interest income at risk for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was million  or lower than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
our simulation modeling of the december  balance sheet  using the market interest rates in effect at period end the rates unchanged scenario  indicated our net interest margin would decline in future periods as 
table of contents many of our interest bearing liabilities would reprice to current rates as they mature or reprice under this scenario 
additional critical factors affecting our net interest margin that are not specifically measured as part of interest rate risk are the impact of competition on loan and deposit pricing as well as changes in our balance sheet such as the mix of our funding 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year we also model changes in the shape steepness of the yield curve  other parallel shifts in the yield  such as a basis point increase in interest rates  and balance sheet growth scenarios 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing under the different interest rate scenarios 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb federal reserve bank stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings notes payable fhlb advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
litigation we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business 
management knows of no such threatened or pending legal actions against us that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  liquidity or operating results
