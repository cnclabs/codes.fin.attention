dependence on a few sources of revenues the company typically derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a small number of properties  which usually generate revenues for only a limited period of time 
the company s revenues are highly subject to changing trends in the toy  game and entertainment businesses  causing dramatic increases and decreases from year to year due to the popularity of particular properties 
it is not possible to accurately predict the length of time that a property will be commercially successful and or if a property will be commercially successful at all 
due to these factors  the company must continually seek new properties from which it can derive revenues 
in addition  the company also does not control the timing of the release of products by licensees which can affect both the amount of licensing revenues earned and the periods during which such revenues are recognized 
two properties  yu gi oh and teenage mutant ninja turtles represented of consolidated net revenues for fiscal one licensee  konami corporation  represented of consolidated net revenues for fiscal for more information on revenues major customers  please see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
trademarks and copyrights except as provided below  the company generally does not own any trademarks or copyrights in properties which the company represents as a merchandising agent 
the trademarks and copyrights are typically owned by the creators of the properties or by other entities  which may have expended substantial amounts of resources in developing or promoting the properties 
the company owns the copyrights and trademarks to charlie chan and the wmac masters live action television series 
the company is also a joint copyright holder of the cubix cgi television series and the episodes of the teenage mutant ninja turtles and chaotic animated television series produced by kids productions 
the company is also a joint copyright holder of the new chaotic trading card artwork for the chaotic trading card game  scheduled to be released to the comic and hobby store distribution channel in spring the company also jointly owns the copyright to the chaotic trading card game as it relates to revisions to the original chaotic trading card game previously sold in denmark 
the company  through its ownership interest in tc websites  jointly owns the intellectual property rights to the website engine and related proprietary software which enables chaotic website visitors to play the chaotic trading card game online at www 
chaoticgame 
com 
seasonal aspects a substantial portion of the company s revenues and net income are subject to the seasonal and trend variations of the toy and game industry 
typically  a majority of toy orders are shipped in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the company s net revenues from toy and game royalties during the second half of the year have generally been greater than during the first half of the year 
additionally  advertising revenues derived from the sale of commercial time on kids tv is generally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher advertising rates derived from children s advertisers for advertising during the holiday season 
competition the company s principal competitors in the area of merchandise licensing are the large media companies eg  disney  time warner and nickelodeon  which is owned by viacom with consumer products merchandise licensing divisions  toy companies  other licensing companies  and numerous individuals who act as merchandising agents 
there are also many independent product development firms with which the company competes 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than the company and represent properties which have been commercially successful for longer periods than the properties represented by the company 
the company believes it would be relatively easy for a potential competitor to enter its market in light of the relatively small investment required to commence operations as a merchandising agent 
the company s advertising media and broadcast segment also operates in a highly competitive marketplace against large media companies eg  disney  time warner  cbs  nbc and nickelodeon  which is owned by viacom with substantially greater resources and distribution networks than the company 
the company s ability to derive advertising revenue from the sale of commercial time on kids tv depends  in substantial part  on the popularity of the television shows that the company broadcasts on kids tv 
the company also faces significant competition from other television broadcasters and cable networks  which also broadcast childrens television shows on saturday mornings 
the company s television and film production distribution segment competes with all forms of entertainment directed at children 
there are a significant number of companies that produce and or broadcast television programming and distribute theatrical motion pictures and home videos for the children s audience 
the company also competes with these companies to obtain creative talent to write  adapt  score  provide voice overs and produce the television programs and theatrical motion pictures marketed by the company and its subsidiaries 
the company s trading card and game distribution segment will also be operating in a highly competitive market against strong competition such as i wizards of the coast which is owned by hasbro and distributes the popular magic the gathering trading card game  ii upper deck  a company that distributes yu gi oh trading cards and sports cards  iii topps  a company that distributes sports cards  and iv nintendo of america and pok mon usa  inc  the companies that distribute the pok mon trading card game 
the chaotic website which is part of the company s trading card and game distribution segment will also be competing with popular online multiplayer game websites such as world of warcraft  the website run by blizzard entertainment  a subsidiary of vivendi 
employees as of march   the company had a total of full time employees in its domestic and international operations 
of the total  employees were primarily rendering services for the licensing segment  were primarily rendering services for the advertising media and broadcasting segment  were primarily rendering services for the television and film production distribution segment and were primarily rendering services for the trading card and game distribution segment

risk factors the following significant factors  as well as others of which we are unaware or deem to be immaterial at this time  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results in the future 
therefore  the following information should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the changing entertainment preferences of consumers could adversely affect our business 
our business and operating results depend upon the appeal of our properties  product concepts and programming to consumers 
consumer s entertainment preferences  as well as industry trends and demands are continuously changing and are difficult to predict as they vary over time 
in addition  as entertainment properties often have short life cycles  there can be no assurances that i our current properties  product concepts or programming will continue to be popular for any significant period of time  ii new properties  product concepts or programming we represent or produce will achieve and or sustain popularity in the marketplace  iii a property s life cycle will be sufficient to permit us to recover revenues in excess of the costs of advance payments  guarantees  development  marketing  royalties and other costs relating to such property  or iv we will successfully anticipate  identify and react to consumer preferences 
our failure to accomplish any of these events could result in reduced overall revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the volatility of consumer preferences could cause our revenues and net income to vary significantly between comparable periods 
revenues from our licensing segment are largely derived from a small number of properties and are subject to changing industry trends 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our licensing revenues from a small number of properties which usually generate revenues only for a limited period of time 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our licensing revenues from two properties 
our licensing revenues are also subject to the changing trends in the toy  game and entertainment industries 
consequently  our licensing revenues may be subject to dramatic increases and decreases from particular sources over time 
in addition  we do not control the timing of the release of products by licensees which can affect both the amount of licensing revenues earned and the periods during which such revenues are recognized 
a significant decrease in our licensing revenues could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenues from our licensing segment are directly impacted by the amount of retail shelf space dedicated to our properties 
as an exclusive merchandising agent  we grant licenses to third parties to manufacture and sell all types of merchandise based on the properties that we represent 
the ability of these third parties to design  manufacture  and ultimately market and sell this merchandise through various distribution channels has a direct impact on our revenues 
if these third parties are not successful in obtaining adequate shelf space for this merchandise at retail  the performance of certain properties could suffer which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating margins could be adversely impacted by the mix of properties we represent 
historically  the majority of the television episodes produced by our production studio were english language dubbed versions of previously produced foreign language programming 
we were able to license television broadcast rights  home video rights and merchandising rights to such foreign language programming for rights fees that were substantially below the cost of producing original programming 
over the past several years  we have begun shifting our strategic focus toward the production of more original animated programming in an effort to obtain a higher percentage of revenue from the series and build the value of our programming library 
the investment required to produce original animated programming is substantially greater than our historical cost of dubbing and adapting existing foreign language animated programming 
our production of original programming funded in whole or in part by us will result in a substantial increase in capitalized film costs that will be amortized based on overall market acceptance and projected revenues 
to the extent that a property performs at a level lower than our expectations  the ratio of amortization expense will increase and may adversely impact our operating margins and results of operations 
if our original programming is not successful  we may be required to write down millions of dollars of capitalized film costs associated with the unsuccessful series  which will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must continually seek new properties from which we can derive revenues 
it is difficult to predict whether a property will be successful  and if so  for how long 
because of this  we are constantly seeking new properties that are already successful or that we believe are likely to become successful in the future 
if we are unable to identify and acquire the rights to successful new properties  our revenues  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business is seasonal and highly dependent on our performance during the holiday season 
a high percentage of our annual operating results have historically depended on our performance during the holiday season 
sales of our licensed toy and game concepts are seasonal and most retail sales of these products occur during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
also  as a result of the increased demand for commercial time by children s advertisers during the holiday season  a significant portion of the revenues generated by kids ad sales occur during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the financial results of kids tv are also affected by how successful it is in attracting viewers during the holiday season 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our business  we would be significantly and adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and other unforeseen events during the holiday season  such as a terrorist attack or a military engagement  that negatively affect the retail environment or consumer buying patterns 
in addition  a failure by us to supply programming to kids tv during the holiday season could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace 
licensing 
our principal competitors in the area of merchandise licensing are the large media companies eg  disney  time warner and nickelodeon  which is owned by viacom with consumer products merchandise licensing divisions  toy companies  other licensing companies  and numerous individuals who act as merchandising agents 
there are also many independent product development firms with which we compete 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than we do and represent properties which have been commercially successful for longer periods than our properties 
we believe that it would be relatively easy for a potential competitor to enter into this market in light of the relatively small investment required to commence operations as a merchandising agent 
advertising media and broadcast 
our advertising media and broadcast segment also operates in a highly competitive marketplace against large media companies eg  disney  time warner  cbs  nbc and nickelodeon  which is owned by viacom with substantially greater resources and distribution networks than we have 
our ability to derive advertising revenue from the sale of commercial time on kids tv depends  in substantial part  on the popularity of the television shows that we broadcast on kids tv 
we also face significant competition from other television broadcasters and cable networks  which also broadcast children s television shows on saturday mornings 
broadcast television for children has been losing popularity over the last few years to the children s cable television channels such as nickelodeon  cartoon network and the disney channel 
in addition  the popularity of the internet  video on demand  digital video recording of programming and other trends have caused a fragmentation of the audience 
both of these trends have resulted in lower advertising revenues from our sale of our advertising time on kids tv 
this reduction of advertising revenues would adversely affect our business and the results of operations 
our agreement with fox for kids tv is set to expire at the end of the broadcast season 
there can be no assurance that fox will renew the agreement or that we will be able to negotiate an extension of the term of the agreement with fox 
if we were unable to extend the term of the agreement and were not able to secure substitute broadcast time for the broadcast of the programming produced by us for the broadcast season and beyond  many of our properties may not be able to get the regular television exposure that we believe is necessary to sustain the popularity of such properties 
consequently  a lack of regular television exposure could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
television and film production distribution 
our television and film production distribution segment competes with all forms of entertainment directed at children 
there are a significant number of companies that produce and or broadcast television programming and distribute theatrical motion pictures and home videos for the children s audience 
we also compete with these companies to obtain creative talent to write  adapt  score  provide voice overs and produce the television programs and theatrical motion pictures marketed by us 
trading card and game distribution 
our trading card and game distribution segment will also be operating in a highly competitive market against strong competition such as i wizards of the coast which is owned by hasbro and distributes the popular magic the gathering trading card game  ii upper deck  a company that distributes yu gi oh trading cards and sports cards  iii topps  a company that distributes sports cards  and iv nintendo of america and pok mon usa  inc  the companies that distribute the pok mon trading card game 
the chaotic website which is part of our trading card and game distribution segment will also be competing with popular online multiplayer game websites such as world of warcraft  the website run by blizzard entertainment  a subsidiary of vivendi 
our broadcasting costs may increase or our advertising revenues may decrease due to events beyond our control 
the success of our advertising media and broadcast segment is largely dependant on the amount of advertising revenues generated from sales of network advertising on kids tv 
recently  there has been increased scrutiny of food advertising directed at children as a result of childhood obesity concerns 
in response to these concerns  several significant food advertisers have reduced or eliminated advertising of food products directed toward children resulting in a reduction in the advertising dollars spent in the children s advertising marketplace 
in addition  international  political and military developments may result in increases in broadcasting costs or loss of advertising revenue due to  among other things  the preemption of kids tv programming 
our trading card and game distribution segment presents certain risks 
our trading card business is a new business and has no operating history 
we expect to invest between approximately and million in tc digital and tc websites in the aggregate 
neither of these companies has any operating history and both will be operating in a highly competitive trading card marketplace 
tc digital will initially distribute one product  the chaotic trading card game 
if the chaotic trading card game is not successful  we will incur substantial losses  including possibly the loss of our entire investment in tc digital and tc websites 
we expect to distribute the chaotic trading card game to the comic book and hobby store distribution channels beginning in the spring of additionally  we expect to distribute the chaotic trading card game to mass market distribution channels beginning in the fall of if the trading card game is not successful in the comic book and hobby store distribution channels  it is possible that we will not receive substantial orders from the mass market distribution channel 
if such events were to occur  it is likely that our investment in tc digital and tc websites would be significantly impaired which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 
tc digital is in the process of seeking and hiring staff with experience in the trading card industry 
it is possible that tc digital will be unable to hire experienced employees in a timely manner which may result in delays in the distribution of the chaotic trading card game to market 
any such delays may result in our inability to fulfill orders and properly market the chaotic trading card game 
these delays could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
card production delays or shortfalls and card inventory risk 
raw materials required for production of the company s products are generally available 
however  the unavailability of certain raw materials or a significant increase in their cost could have a material adverse affect on our future plans and operating results 
our production of cards to meet anticipated retailer demand could cause an inventory surplus and result in markdowns and increased inventory carrying costs for us on even our most successful products 
additionally  if we underestimate demand for our products  we may be unable to provide adequate supplies of popular products to retailers in a timely fashion  and may consequently lose sales opportunities 
there may be issues with the functionality of the chaotic website 
each chaotic trading card will have a unique code which will enable the chaotic card collector to enter or upload the chaotic trading card codes to the companion website  www 
chaoticgame 
com 
it is expected that the chaotic website will enable each chaotic card collector to battle online using the chaotic cards that have been uploaded to the card collector s online account 
the chaotic website is in the final stages of development but has not yet been completed or fully tested 
there can be no assurance that the chaotic website will be completed and fully operational in a timely manner or that the website will operate properly 
if the chaotic website were not to be fully operational when the trading card game is released or if the website were not to operate properly after the website goes live  the success of the trading card game would be adversely affected 
such circumstances could significantly impair our investment in tc digital and tc websites and could require that we invest additional amounts in tc websites in order to complete the chaotic trading game companion website 
advertising revenues from the chaotic website may be less than anticipated 
we do not expect that visitors to the chaotic website will be charged a fee for playing the chaotic trading card game online 
it is anticipated that the website will be supported by advertising revenues 
there can be no assurance that advertising revenues will be sufficient to support the costs expected to be incurred in the operation of the website and in the periodic upgrades of the website 
if advertising revenues are not sufficient to cover the costs of operating the website  the losses incurred by tc websites may significantly impair our investment in tc websites and adversely impact our business and the results of operations 
dependence on limited number of customers and distributors 
we expect our trading card and game distribution segment to be dependent on several large customers  certain of which are serviced by a single distributor 
the loss of any of these customers or distributors could materially adversely affect our future plans and results in this segment 
our future success is dependent on certain key employees 
the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the skills  experience and efforts of a number of senior management personnel and other key employees 
in many instances  we have employment agreements in place as a method of retaining the services of these key employees 
the loss of the services of any of the senior management personnel and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect the intellectual property rights that we own or license 
it is possible that third parties may challenge our rights to such intellectual property 
in addition  there is a risk of third parties infringing upon our or our licensors intellectual property rights and producing counterfeit products 
these events may result in lost revenue as well as litigation  which may be expensive and time consuming even if a favorable outcome is obtained 
there can be no assurance that there are adequate remedies for any infringement 
any such failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we may be negatively affected by adverse general economic and other conditions 
conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely unpredictable and our business has been and in the future may be  impacted by changes in such conditions 
softening global economies  stock market uncertainty and wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  war or other factors generally affecting economic conditions may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must be able to respond to rapidly changing technology occurring within our industry 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to numerous changes in our industry resulting from technological developments such as the internet  broadband distribution of entertainment content and the adoption of digital television standards 
these new distribution technologies may diminish the size of the audience watching broadcast television and require us to fundamentally change the way we market and distribute our properties 
for example  digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies 
these changes could significantly decrease our revenues or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
potential labor disputes may lead to increased costs or disrupt the operation of our business 
the success of our business is dependant on our employees who are involved with our domestic and international operations 
any labor dispute may adversely affect one or more of our business segments through increased costs of operating such segment or disruption of the operations of such segment which could adversely affect our results of operations
