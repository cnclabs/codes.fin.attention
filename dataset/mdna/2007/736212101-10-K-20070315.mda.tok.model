pension plan contributions that may be required more than one year from december  will be dependent upon the performance of plan assets 
represents the deferred purchase price payable to the former shareholders of coronet rail 
financial condition at december  total assets were million  an increase of million from million as of december  the increase at december  is primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets of million  which includes million and million of intangible assets and goodwill purchased as a result of the coronet rail stock purchase and vulcan asset acquisition  respectively 
also contributing to the increase are higher accounts receivable and inventories  which increased million  and includes million of coronet rail assets acquired in april additionally  our property  plant  and equipment  including assets held for sale  increased  which includes  of building improvements  machinery and equipment related to the acquisition of coronet rail and  of vulcan machinery and equipment purchased in october partially offsetting these increases in assets is a decrease of million in cash  primarily to support capital expenditures  repay indebtedness  and to fund direct acquisition costs during total outstanding debt obligations at december  increased by approximately million or  to million as of december   from million at december  the increase in total outstanding debt obligations is primarily due to bank term loans obtained in april and october in the original amounts of million and million  respectively  to finance the acquisitions of coronet rail and the asset purchase of vulcan chain corporation 
partially offsetting this increase is a decrease in the kelsan acquisition loan with national city bank canada  which reflects principal payments of million during we maintain a defined benefit pension plan that covers a significant number of our united states employees  former employees and retirees 
benefits under the plan were based on years of service for hourly employees 
for salaried employees  benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s average compensation during defined periods of service 
in august  we amended our united states defined benefit plan by freezing the benefits accrued for all participants effective december  and preventing new enrollments after december  our future net periodic pension cost and plan funding will be dependent upon the performance of plan assets 
we also maintain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom that cover certain active employees  former employees and retirees 
benefits under the plan were based on years of service and eligible compensation during defined periods of service 
in september  we amended these plans by freezing the benefits accrued for all participants effective december  the products we manufacture and sell  such as our rail joints  rail anchors and rail spikes  require steel as a major element in the production process 
worldwide steel prices began to increase in  resulting in surcharges being added to our overall raw material costs 
we have been successful in passing along to our customers at no additional profit margins  the majority of surcharges that we incurred from our suppliers 
however  during we began to see a transition from surcharges to higher base prices for some of the materials  primarily steel  used in our track component products 
as a result  we have incurred higher material costs which have had an impact on our financial results in if a prolonged increase in steel prices should continue and we are unable to pass on these added costs to our customers  our future earnings could be negatively impacted 
discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are delivered and title has passed or when service is performed 
delivery is determined by our shipping terms  which are primarily fob shipping point 
shipments are made only under a valid contract or purchase order where the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of returns  discounts and other allowances 
revenue from installation of material handling equipment and railway wayside data collection and data management systems is generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each contract to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
the length of each contract varies  but is typically about two to five months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date  to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  repairs and depreciation costs 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is immediately recorded in the accounting period that the loss is determined 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of total costs or revenue during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision first become known 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain a reserve to absorb probable losses relating to bad debts arising from uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we consider adequate to absorb probable bad debts inherent in the accounts receivable balance and is based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of the collectibility  historical loss experience of accounts receivable and the financial status of customers with accounts receivable balances 
bad debts are charged and recoveries are credited to the reserve when incurred 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because we have a significant concentration of accounts receivable in the rail industry 
the economic conditions could affect our customers ability to pay and changes in the estimate could have a material effect on net income 
inventories 
we establish obsolescence reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
obsolescence reserves reduce the carrying value of slow moving and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value  which generally approximates the recoverable scrap value 
we utilize historical usage  our experience  current backlog and forecasted usage to evaluate our reserve amounts 
we also periodically evaluate our inventory carrying value to ensure that the amounts are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the goodwill of each of our reporting units for impairment as required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our judgment 
factors that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include  but are not limited to  different assumptions used to forecast future revenue  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models 
in addition  selection of a risk adjusted discount rate on the estimated undiscounted cash flow is susceptible to future changes in market conditions and when unfavorable  can adversely affect our original estimates of fair values 
since adoption of sfas  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
as part of the acquisition of coronet rail and the vulcan acquisition  we recorded the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the companies in accordance with sfas no 
as part of our procedures to assign fair values to all acquired assets  we engaged an independent valuation expert to evaluate the technology and intellectual property along with other intangible assets that could be assigned a fair value under these acquisitions 
we supplied the independent valuation expert with the historical and estimated cash flows of the companies along with an estimate of future costs to maintain these technologies 
the independent valuation expert used these estimates and other assumptions to determine the present value of the discounted cash flows of these various technologies 
in addition  we evaluated the future lives of the identified intangible assets to determine if they have definite or indefinite lives 
as a result of the coronet rail acquisition  we assigned a fair value of million million pounds sterling to customer relationships    pounds sterling to non compete agreements  and   pounds sterling to a supply agreement 
we also determined that there was million million pounds sterling of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we have estimated that the customer relationships  non compete agreements  and supply agreement have definite lives of years  years  and years  respectively  due to our estimates that projected economic earnings associated with these intangible assets will begin to lapse after these time frames 
in the future  we will monitor these intangible assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives assigned to these intangible assets to become shorter than originally assigned  and therefore  we would assign a shorter future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and then record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
as a result of the vulcan acquisition  we assigned fair values of million to customer relationships   to a unique customer relationship   to vehicle restraint assembly technology g van patent   to a supply agreement and  to non compete agreements 
we also determined that there was  of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we have estimated that the customer relationships  a unique customer relationship  vehicle restraint assembly technology  supply agreement  and non compete agreements have definite lives of years  years  years  years and years  respectively  due to our estimates that the projected economic earnings associated with these intangible assets will begin to lapse after these time frames 
in the future  we will monitor these assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives assigned to these intangible assets to become shorter than originally assigned  and thereby  we would assign a shorter future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
retirement benefit plans 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover a significant number of our active employees  former employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employer s accounting for defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans 
the liabilities and expenses for pensions require significant judgments and estimates 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  inflation  the long term rate of return on plan assets and mortality tables 
management has mitigated the future liability for active employees by freezing all defined benefit pension plans effective december  the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds that could be used to settle obligations of the plan 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations 
the effects of actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense 
we maintain a post retirement benefit plan at our canadian operation near montreal  which provides retiree life insurance  health care benefits and  for a closed group of employees  dental care 
we account for this plan under sfas no 
the liabilities and expenses for post retirement benefit plans require significant judgments and estimates 
these amounts are actuarially determined using the projected benefit method pro rated on service and significant management assumptions  including salary escalation  retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs 
retirement benefit plan adjustments and changes in assumptions are amortized to earnings over the estimated average remaining service life of the members and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense 
as interest rates decline  the actuarially calculated retirement benefit plan liability increases 
conversely  as interest rates increase  the actuarially calculated retirement benefit plan liability decreases 
past declines in interest rates and equity markets have had a negative impact on the retirement benefit plan liability and fair value of our plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at december   and  which resulted in a   and  net of tax  respectively  charge to other comprehensive loss 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as a company with international operations  we record an estimated liability or benefit for our current income tax provision and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
we do not believe that such a charge would be material 
the process of recording deferred tax assets and liabilities involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense is recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our experience  current economic situation and budgets 
we believe that operations will provide taxable income levels to recover the deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our contractual long term debt obligations and our working capital facilities are under floating interest rate arrangements 
however  we have determined that these risks are not significant enough to warrant hedging programs 
if interest rates increase  we will be exposed to higher interest rates and we will be required to use more cash to settle our long term debt obligations 
as interest rates increase on our variable long term debt  it will have a negative impact on future earnings because the increased rates will increase our interest expense 
conversely  if interest rates decrease on our variable long term debt  it will have a positive impact on future earnings because the lower rates will decrease our interest expense 
based upon the long term debt amount as of december   for every increase or decrease in the interest rate on our long term debt  our annual interest expense will fluctuate by approximately in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations with our two international operations 
we do not have any foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures 
therefore  we are exposed to the related effects when the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate 
if the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar and or the british pound sterling  the translation rate for these foreign currencies will decrease  which will have a negative impact on our operating income 
for example  for the year ended december   for every change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar  our canadian operation s operating income would have changed by approximately  further  for every change in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling to the us dollar  the impact on operating income for our united kingdom operations for the year ended december  would have been approximately  foreign currency translation fluctuations have no impact on cash flows as long as we continue to reinvest any profits back into the respective foreign operations
