for a discussion of factors and trends that could impact our business and results  please refer to the section above entitled risk factors 
the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  a decline from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of our everest controller sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and our loss of revenues associated with the pmc sierra contract early in the year 
engineering services and maintenance revenues declined primarily due to downward price pressure arising from an increasingly competitive global workforce as well as substantial pressure towards consolidation on our oem customers 
product licensing revenues increased slightly as a result of an aggressive push by our sales and marketing department to close million in block license revenues in fiscal the company hired a new chief executive officer in the middle of the fourth quarter and has implemented a restructuring plan that is intended to streamline the business and improve operational efficiencies 
in addition to a renewed emphasis on profitable operation  the chief executive officer initiated a detailed examination of the existing business and is in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives to fuel growth outside the core disciplines of imaging  adobe postscript  networking and hardware ip 
these alternatives may be select product segments that may blend well with our core business and be additive to our top line performance over the long term 
this may involve acquisitions  joint venture opportunities and strategic relationships and our focus is in the application software sector and all in one device market 
any new strategic initiative will bring new risks and we may not be successful 
nonetheless we are excited by the direction we have embarked on and the opportunities we are exploring with the objective of improving the growth performance of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased over fiscal to million 
this increase was primarily due to a one time charge associated with our reduction in work force  a one time charge associated with the consultancy agreement with our former ceo  stock based compensation expense that has not been required to be recorded in the statement of operations in previous years  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses resulting from our recent classification as an accelerated filer and non recurring legal fees associated with contractual matters related to agreements with some of our larger customers 
our product development relationship with kyocera mita is very meaningful to us 
we are encouraged by the long range opportunities this relationship represents to the company 
as has been stated in the past  we have no influence over when products containing peerless technologies will enter the market  or how much peerless ip will be included 
the company s expected licensing revenues  by any measure  are a function of many factors over which the company has no control  including  but not limited to  the market s acceptance of kyocera mita products  the continued downward pressure on the suggested retail price of printers in the kyocera mita market segments  downward price pressure on the company s core intellectual properties and the overall volume of printers being delivered to the market 
we are seeking to finalize the kyocera mita agreements and position the company to realize the benefit of these licensing agreements as soon as possible 
our ability to finalize these agreements is crucial to our profitability 
see note of the consolidated financial statements  included herein for subsequent events 
as previously stated  we are looking into alternatives to fuel growth and reduce our revenue concentration risks with our large oem customers 
in  our top three customers accounted for of our total revenues and we saw this customer reliance deteriorate to our top two customers accounting for of our total revenues in one of our key oem customers no longer accounted for more than of total revenues in that year 
this customer concentration risk  as well as our reliance on the block licensing model  demonstrates our need to look for growth outside our core markets 
we have experienced two consecutive profitable fiscal years  and prior to we were unprofitable in four of the previous five fiscal years 
there are many risks and uncertainties that may impact our performance and there can be no assurances that we will continue to be profitable at any time in the future 
as a result of the potential decline of oem revenue and an uncertain future  the company intends to diversify its business to better ensure growth and profitability 
the company intends to seek to maximize its strength in the following traditional core areas imaging  adobe postscript  networking and hardware ip 
in addition  we will focus on the solution software application area and the all in one  or aio  marketplace 
this would be attractive primarily  but not exclusively  to our existing customer base and could lead to additional revenue opportunities 
the company plans to seek to acquire or invest in existing business enterprises to accomplish this goal 
while the company has begun research and investigation  no agreement has been entered into with any third party 
it is our expectation that this strategy will strengthen our revenue streams and help achieve long term earnings growth 
our inability to implement our strategic plan  develop and offer products  and manage expansion in the aforementioned marketplaces  as well as the static to declining sales trend of our existing licenses  downward price pressure on our existing technologies  uncertainty surrounding third party license revenue sharing agreements  downward price pressure on oem products and the anticipated consolidation of the number of oems in the marketplace  may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
see  item a 
risk factors 
general we generate revenue from our oems through the licensing of our imaging solutions in sdk form and the sale of engineering services 
beginning in fiscal year  we experienced a shift in demand away from turnkey engineering services contracts towards demand for software solutions in the form of sdks 
we have attempted to expand our high performance color solutions by seamlessly incorporating our networking technologies and related imaging technologies licensed from third parties into sdks 
our product licensing revenues are comprised of both recurring per unit and block licensing revenues and development licensing fees for source code or sdks 
licensing revenues are derived from per unit fees paid periodically by our oem customers upon manufacturing and subsequent commercial shipment of products incorporating our technology 
licensing revenues are also derived from arrangements in which we enable third party technology  such as solutions from adobe or novell  to be used with peerless and or our oem partners products 
block licenses are per unit licenses made in large volume quantities to an oem for products either in or about to enter into distribution into the marketplace 
payment schedules for block licenses are negotiable and payment terms are often dependent on the size of the block and other terms and conditions of the block license being acquired 
typically  payments are made in either one lump sum or over a period of four quarters 
revenue received for block licenses is recognized in accordance with sop  which requires that revenue be recognized after acceptance by the oem and if fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of fees is probable and the company has no future obligations 
for block licenses that have payments due within twelve months  revenue is recognized at the time the block license becomes effective  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria has been met 
we also have engineering services revenues that are derived primarily from adapting our software and supporting electronics to specific oem requirements 
we provide our engineering services to oems seeking a turnkey imaging solution for their digital document products 
our maintenance revenues are derived from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance revenues currently constitute a small portion of total revenue 
historically  a limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of our revenues 
therefore  the availability and successful closing of new contracts  amendments to existing contracts or modifications or additions to existing contracts with these customers may materially impact our financial position and results of operations from quarter to quarter 
our technology has addressed the worldwide market for monochrome printers pages per minute and mfp pages per minute 
this market has been consolidating  and the demand for the monochrome technology and products offered by us declined throughout fiscal year oems have continued to reduce the absolute number of new products being developed and in some instances  oems have preferred to perform in house development projects for the products that they are developing and or planning to launch 
although there have been fewer opportunities for us to sell our turnkey services and sdks  we continue to support our current oem controller customers in the digital printing devices business with our existing and new technologies 
in response to our concern that the demand for our core monochrome offerings may decline and that we may continue to meet sales resistance from our customers  we have developed and commercialized high performance color imaging and printing technologies and a new open architecture 
we believe that our products based on the peerless high performance color architecture address key growth areas in the imaging market including increased demand for color imaging  the emergence of aios  and continued demand for faster low cost monochrome printing solutions 
in addition  as a result of the complexities of the imaging industry  we continue to explore opportunities to enhance shareholder value  including aggressive marketing of our new technologies  developing new market opportunities  raising additional capital and evaluating potential merger and acquisition candidates 
as a result of potential decline of oem revenue and uncertainty of future engineering services contracts of significant size the company intends to diversify its business to better ensure growth and profitability 
the company intends to maximize its strength in the following traditional core areas imaging  adobe postscript  networking  and hardware intellectual property 
in addition  the short term focus is on the solution software application area that would be attractive to primarily  but not exclusively  to our existing customer base 
the company plans to acquire or invest in existing enterprises to accomplish this goal 
while the company has begun research and investigation  no agreement has been entered into with any third party 
the long term strategy is to analyze the benefits of expanding to hardware  devices  or means of transferring images and data that can leverage the core competencies and customers of the company 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we account for our software revenues in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by statement of position if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
we recognize revenues for certain of our engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at the end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal year  we reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
however  product licensing cost increased by million during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of a change in estimate reported by one of our oem customers 
as of january   we had net operating loss carry forwards available to reduce future federal and state income of approximately  thousand and  thousand  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal years for federal and for state  respectively 
in addition  as of january   we had tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately  thousand which begin to expire in fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
we have provided a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
our recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
on february   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior period results are not restated 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
using a black scholes option pricing model  and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
the company uses its actual stock trading history as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the multiple option ie accelerated approach to the single option ie straight line method 
compensation expense for share based awards granted through january  will continue to be subject to the accelerated multiple option method  while compensation expense for share based awards granted on or after february  will be recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
the company recognizes these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of four years 
we recorded thousand in share based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended january  share based compensation expense was allocated as follows for the twelve month period ended january  thousand included in cost of sales  thousand included in research and development expense  thousand included in sales and marketing  thousand included in general and administrative expense 
the company granted  thousand options for the fiscal year ended january  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to total revenues

net income net income for the twelve month period ended january  was million or per basic and per diluted share  compared to a net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in fiscal year  and a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases in fiscal year were primarily the result of the discontinuation of our everest controller product and other hardware sales which amounted to million in revenues in fiscal year and the cancellation of the pmc sierra contract 
the increases in revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year were primarily the result of the million in engineering services revenues from the kyocera mita agreement and increases in product licensing 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during the year 
the remaining million will be recognized in fiscal year this is compared with block licensing agreements of million signed in fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the increase in product licensing revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of aggressive selling of block licenses on existing technologies to our larger customers in the latter half of the fiscal year 
engineering services and maintenance revenues generated by us were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase realized over the last two years was the result of the kyocera mita agreement that generated approximately million in revenues during fiscal year and revenue generated by hardware sales was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the fiscal year decrease from the previous two years was the result of the discontinuance of the everest controller product 
contract and maintenance backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january   which does not include the amounts expected under the kyocera mita agreement 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year product licensing costs were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of lower levels of third party technologies in our product licensing revenues 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to increased product licensing revenues 
engineering services and maintenance cost of sales increased to million in fiscal year compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase realized over the last twenty four months was the result of the engineering staffing applied to the approximately million in services revenue generated by the kyocera mita agreement 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the percentage increase in fiscal year was the result of the higher proportion of licensing revenues combined with a higher level of our intellectual property offsetting the lower gross margins attributable to engineering services and hardware sales 
the decrease in fiscal year comparatively was the result of much higher levels of engineering services revenues which generate lower margins than licensing 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year expenses compared to the previous fiscal year was the result of development efforts associated with the system on a chip soc networking and new color technologies 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of a substantial portion of engineering staffing being applied to the kyocera mita services effort 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was the result of a reduction in staffing levels and sales commission expense 
we continued to focus on the launch of new peerless imaging and networking technologies and on developing new oem customers  attending industry trade shows  and evaluating other opportunities to promote our core and new color imaging and network solutions 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the fiscal increase was primarily due to a one time charge associated with our expense reduction program  a one time charge associated with the consultancy agreement with our former ceo  stock based compensation expense that has not been required to be recorded in the statement of operations in previous years  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses resulting from our recent classification as an accelerated filer and non recurring legal fees associated with contractual matters related to agreements with some of our larger customers 
interest income  other income and expenses  and taxes interest income earned in all fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
the increase in fiscal year was a result of a higher level of investments 
the provisions for income taxes for prior fiscal years were primarily the result of foreign income taxes paid 
these income taxes were paid through withholdings on payments of licensing revenues made by our customers to us 
in july  a new tax treaty between the united states and japan ended the requirement for such income taxes 
the effect was to nearly eliminate our foreign income tax provision in all periods subsequent to the effective date of the new treaty 
we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations outstanding purchase orders total liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents which  as of january  were million in the aggregate  compared to million at january  the increase was primarily the result of cash provided by operations million  million in funds provided by stock options being exercised and cash used by investing activities in the amount of million 
compared to january   total assets at january  increased to million and stockholders equity increased to million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
we generated million in cash during the twelve month period ended january  from operations as compared to million in cash provided by operations during the twelve month period ended january  our investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  used cash of million compared to million provided in fiscal year the difference was attributed to the proceeds from the sale of securities of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  million was provided by exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal year and million in fiscal year at january   net trade receivables were million lower than at january   due primarily to the timing of the signings and collections of new licensing agreements at the end of the fiscal years 
as previously mentioned  subsequent to january   we signed an mou with kyocera mita corporation 
the mou provides  among other things  for quarterly payments of million for the next three years for the development of future products 
we expect cash and investments will increase during fiscal year we expect the mou with kyocera mita to provide much of the increase  and  although we expect the cash position to further increase  there can be no assurances that we will experience the anticipated increase 
we expect to reduce operating expenses as a result of completion of the majority of peerless imaging and networking technologies development effort 
however  if the level of peerless imaging and networking technologies sales is lower than anticipated  we may need to take significant measures to preserve and maintain continued business operations 
in such event  we may need to further reduce costs and may have to access the capital markets to raise additional funding 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in raising capital at attractive terms or at all  and should we be successful in raising capital  the financing may be dilutive to current shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we do not hold any positions in equity securities of other publicly traded companies 
our exposure to interest rate risk in the past relates primarily to our non equity investment portfolio 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we  from time to time  maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the federal  state and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
as of january   we did not hold any corporate debt securities 
although we are subject to interest rate risks in any future investments in these types of securities  we believe an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
consequently  our interest rate risk is minimal 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of our contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  and have no intention of doing so
