item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statement and supplementary data in item of this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements below 
overview and recent developments we provide contract drilling and related services to oil and natural gas companies worldwide  operating both offshore and on land 
as of february   we owned a global fleet of rigs  consisting of two deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  tender assisted  barge and platform rigs and land based drilling and workover rigs 
our customers include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies and state owned national oil companies 
our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller  locally owned companies 
in september  we reorganized our operations into three principal reportable segments offshore  latin america land  and e p services 
the realignment of our reportable segments was attributable to implementation of a better methodology to manage our business and organizational changes  including the hiring of a chief operating officer responsible for all of our offshore drilling fleet 
our offshore segment includes all of our offshore drilling fleet and operations 
our latin america land segment includes all of our land based drilling and workover services in latin america 
our e p services segment includes our exploration and production services business in latin america 
all prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation of these three segments 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
in november  we acquired from our joint venture partner its interest in a joint venture company the principal assets of which are two deepwater semi submersible drilling rigs  the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro 
the acquisition increased our ownership interest in the joint venture company and the rigs from to 
consideration consisted of million in cash  assumed debt valued at million  and earn out payments  if any  to be made during the six year period subject to certain extensions for non operating periods following the expiration of the existing drilling contracts for the rigs 
such earn out payments will equal of the amount  if any  by which the standard operating dayrate  excluding bonuses  for a rig less adjustments to reflect certain capital additions and certain increases in operating costs exceeds  or  in the case of petrobras  which currently contracts with a bonus opportunity  
due to the termination of lease agreements between us and the joint venture company and because the related operating contracts for the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro at the time of acquisition were unfavorable compared with current market rates  we recorded a non cash deferred contract liability of million to record the difference between stated values of the non cancelable contracts and the current fair value of contracts with similar terms 
the deferred contract liability will be amortized to revenues over the remaining lives of the contracts of approximately four years 
we funded the purchase price with cash on hand and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
as a result of the transaction  the joint venture company  which was accounted for as an equity investment  is now consolidated in our financial statements  resulting in the recording of approximately million of debt  net of fair value discount  of the joint venture company to our consolidated balance sheet 
the debt  which is guaranteed by the us maritime administration  is more fully described under liquidity and capital resources other outstanding debt 
in a related transaction  we cancelled future obligations under certain existing agency relationships related to five offshore rigs we operate in brazil  including the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro 
for this cancellation  we paid million in cash  which we expensed during the fourth quarter 
table of contents in november  we agreed to contract terms for four of our rigs operating offshore brazil the pride brazil  the pride carlos walter  the pride south atlantic  and the pride south america 
expected aggregate dayrate revenues under these contracts total approximately billion  with approximately million of additional performance bonus opportunities 
we expect to commence operations under the new five year contracts after the current contract commitment for each rig is complete  beginning with the pride south america during the second quarter  followed by the pride south atlantic in the second quarter and the pride brazil and the pride carlos walter in the third quarter each of these contracts includes cost escalation provisions that commenced upon the contract award 
we also agreed to a three year contract for the pride north america that includes a dayrate in the mid  s  with the third year adjusted up or down by a maximum of  according to an index of average contract dayrates for similar rigs during the fourth quarter this contract  which is expected to begin during the first quarter of  includes cost escalation provisions that commenced upon signing 
fcpa investigation during the course of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our latin american operations  our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials 
in february  shortly after and as a result of certain statements that were made by an employee during the investigation  the audit committee of our board of directors assumed direct responsibility over the investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations  as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues  and to advise the audit committee 
the investigation  which is continuing  has found evidence suggesting that payments  which may violate the us foreign corrupt practices act  were made to government officials in latin america aggregating less than million 
the evidence to date regarding these payments suggests that payments were made beginning in early through a to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore venezuela  and b to one or more government officials  or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials  for the purpose of collecting payment for work completed in connection with offshore drilling contracts in venezuela 
in addition  the evidence suggests that other payments were made beginning in through early a to one or more government officials in mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs or the movement of personnel through immigration  and b with respect to the potentially improper entertainment of government officials in mexico 
the audit committee  through independent outside counsel  has undertaken a review of our compliance with the fcpa in certain of our other international operations 
this review has found evidence suggesting that in and payments may have been made to government officials in saudi arabia and kazakhstan  aggregating less than  in connection with clearing rigs or equipment through customs or resolving outstanding customs issues in those countries 
the investigation of the matters related to saudi arabia and kazakhstan and the audit committee s compliance review are ongoing 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that evidence of additional potential fcpa violations may not be uncovered in saudi arabia  kazakhstan or other countries 
our management and the audit committee of our board of directors believe it likely that members of our senior operations management either were aware  or should have been aware  that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made 
our former chief operating officer resigned as chief operating officer effective on may  and has elected to retire from the company  although he will remain an employee  but not an officer  during the pendency of the investigation to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business 
his retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our audit committee or our board of directors that it does not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment 
on december   our vice president western hemisphere operations resigned 
on december   our former country manager in venezuela and mexico was terminated 
we have placed another member of our senior operations management on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation 
we voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation and compliance review to the us department of justice and the securities and exchange 
table of contents commission and are cooperating with these authorities as the investigation and compliance reviews continue and as they review the matter 
if violations of the fcpa occurred  we could be subject to fines  civil and criminal penalties  equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement  and injunctive relief 
civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  sanctions or other penalties 
we have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty  integrity  ethical standards and compliance with the law 
these actions continue a process we had previously commenced 
since late  we have created and filled a legal and ethical compliance function under the supervision of our senior vice president  general counsel and secretary 
we have established an antibribery compliance committee and enhanced our antibribery compliance procedures 
we also have developed in person and online training programs to provide annual instruction on our code of business conduct and ethical practices  the fcpa  antitrust law and other key policies as part of our commitment to educate our international workforce 
in  we also continued to enhance our training of management  including our operations managers  to emphasize further the importance of setting the proper tone within their organization to instill an attitude of integrity and control awareness and the use of a thorough and proper analysis of proposed transactions  determined that our bonus eligible employees complete in person and online training on the fcpa and our code of business conduct and ethical practices as a prerequisite to receiving their bonuses for  required our management  including our operations managers  to reconfirm that they are not aware of any violations of law and confirm with greater specificity that they are not aware of any improper payments to foreign government officials made by us or on our behalf or any other violation of our code of business conduct and ethical practices and to recertify their commitment to the code  established an executive compliance committee  consisting of our executive officers and other management level employees who are responsible for supervising our antibribery compliance committee  our internal controls steering committee and our compliance efforts in general  and established a separate position of  and appointed  a chief compliance officer 
we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec  the applicable government or other authorities or our customers or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions 
for the years ended december   and  our operations in venezuela provided revenues of approximately million  million  and million  or approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues  respectively 
our venezuela operations provided earnings loss from operations of approximately million  million  and million or approximately  and of our total consolidated earnings from operations for  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had accounts receivable from petr leos de venezuela  sa totaling million and million  respectively 

table of contents business environment we provide contract drilling services to major integrated  government owned and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world 
our offshore drilling fleet competes on a global basis  as offshore rigs generally are highly mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
our land based fleet generally competes on a regional basis 
while the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
rig availability and each contractor s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination 
substantially all of our drilling contracts with major customers are on a dayrate basis  where we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
we provide the rigs and drilling crews and are responsible for the payment of operating and maintenance expenses 
our customer bears the economic risk relative to the success of the wells 
the markets for our drilling  workover and related e p services are highly cyclical 
our operating results are significantly impacted by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling and related services 
these drilling programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies expectations about oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  demand for crude oil and natural gas products  government regulations and many other factors 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling and related services 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
contracts in the us gulf of mexico  for example  tend to be short term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to impact our operations quickly 
contracts in international offshore markets tend to be longer term due to rig availability  mobilization costs and technical requirements 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions in these markets may have little or no short term impact on our revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the market changes occur during a period when we are attempting to renew a number of those contracts 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply and demand for drilling and related services in the different geographic regions in which we operate 
the number of available rigs may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition  relocation or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs and the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another for which we may receive a mobilization fee 
mobilization fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract 
changes in earnings from operations are primarily affected by revenues  cost of labor and utilization of our drilling fleet 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of the rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which reduces expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income associated with the loss of revenues 
our operations and activities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the us oil pollution act of  the us outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  other countries where we operate have similar laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
business outlook expectations about future oil prices have historically been a key driver for drilling demand  however  the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  relative production costs  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs 
we expect 
table of contents global demand for contract drilling services to continue to increase  driven by increasing worldwide energy demand and demand for oil and natural gas and an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on offshore prospects 
our deepwater fleet  which consists of our drillships and our semisubmersibles operating in water depths greater than  feet  currently operates in west africa  brazil and egypt  and is fully contracted through june  with most of our fleet contracted into in november  we were awarded five year contract extensions beginning in for the pride brazil and pride carlos walter and a three year contract extension for the pride north america  each at substantially higher dayrates 
we have contracted the pride south pacific under a two year contract at a dayrate three times the prior contract rate beginning in march the balance of our deepwater fleet is contracted through and our average dayrate is not expected to change materially  other than as a result of cost escalation protection  until contract rollovers occur 
we believe that long term market conditions for deepwater drilling services are favorable and that demand for deepwater rigs will continue to exceed supply for the next several years 
we believe that favorable commodity prices for oil  geological successes in exploratory markets and  in general  more favorable political conditions will continue to encourage the development of new projects by exploration and production companies on a number of major discoveries 
in addition  we believe that the need for deepwater rigs will continue to grow for existing offshore development projects in west africa  the gulf of mexico and brazil 
prospects for our midwater fleet  which consists of our semisubmersibles operating in water depths from  feet to  feet and which currently operates in west africa  brazil  the mediterranean sea and mexico  continue to be robust with approximately of our fleet contracted through the end of at present  increasing demand and limited availability of rigs continues to drive dayrates higher 
contracts for midwater rigs tend to be shorter in duration than deepwater rigs with one to three years as the typical length 
we believe increasing demand  a limited ability to increase rig supply in the short term and excess demand for rigs will result in favorable market conditions through we contracted the pride south america at a substantially higher dayrate for a five year term that began in february the pride south seas and pride south atlantic will rollover to new contracts at higher dayrates in we expect our average dayrates for our midwater fleet to continue to improve due to repricing of our fleet in and during  three of our rigs are scheduled to be out of service for scheduled regulatory inspection and maintenance 
we expect the outlook for the international jackup market to continue to remain strong due to the current jackup rig supply shortage 
demand for jackup rigs in international markets continues to be strong and average dayrates remain high with longer term contracts 
however  we continue to monitor the potential effect of the addition of approximately newbuild jackups to the global market  which have scheduled delivery dates from through the addition of rig capacity to the market could have an adverse impact on our utilization and dayrates  particularly in international markets 
the dayrate environment in the us gulf of mexico has been under pressure from lower demand and uncertain natural gas prices due to high storage levels 
we anticipate that the market may strengthen in the second half of as several rigs owned by our competitors are expected to leave the gulf of mexico for international markets and the demand for additional rigs by pemex and other international clients is expected to increase 
improvement in dayrates in will largely depend upon natural gas prices and any impact of the hurricane season on our customers drilling programs 
the pride tennessee completed its shipyard upgrade in february and is contracted through july we have rigs currently scheduled for maintenance and upgrade projects in  as compared to rigs that were out of service for maintenance and upgrade projects in following the completion of these projects  we expect the number of projects to decline significantly in the ability to complete the projects on a timely basis could have a significant impact on results 
we experienced high levels of activity for our latin america land and e p services operations  which resulted in higher pricing and utilization 
the market outlook for argentina and colombia remains favorable as economic growth has stimulated demand for oil and natural gas 
we currently believe that market conditions in venezuela will permit us to recover the additional cost associated with recently enacted social programs and do not believe our operations will be materially impacted 
in october  we experienced a two day strike against our latin america land operation in northern argentina  which temporarily idled approximately of our rigs 
during the fourth quarter  our operations in 
table of contents argentina experienced additional work stoppages on both local and national levels organized by the unions in protest of various labor and tax laws 
the issues were resolved with the unions in december we believe our relationships with the unions are good and we are not currently aware of any threatened or pending work stoppages 
however  industry conditions and changes in the political environments in which we operate have  from time to time  resulted in work stoppages 
such work stoppages may occur in the future and may have a significant impact on our future operations or financial position 
we are actively pursuing options for maximizing the value of our latin america land and e p services operations 
all options are being considered  including sales to strategic buyers and capital market alternatives 
we may ultimately decide to pursue a course of action other than a disposition of these operations  however  if we do pursue a disposition  we may be unable to complete a transaction on terms we find acceptable or at all 
increased activity in the oilfield services industry is increasing competition for experienced oilfield workers resulting in higher labor costs and training costs 
the increased activity has also increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts and coupled with the consolidation of equipment suppliers  has resulted in longer order lead times to obtain critical spares and higher repair and maintenance costs and increased out of service time for repair and upgrade projects 
a number of our rigs will be in the shipyard or undergoing repairs during and may be subject to repair delays 
in addition  as a result of the significant insurance losses incurred by the drilling industry during the and hurricane seasons  our insurance costs increased significantly when our policies renewed in july our insurance underwriters have also imposed an aggregate limit of approximately million for damage due to named wind storms in the us gulf of mexico  with a million deductible per named wind storm 
however  due to higher dayrates  we expect our growth in revenues to continue to outpace our cost increases throughout critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and  accordingly  these estimates may change as additional information is obtained  as more experience is acquired  as our operating environment changes and as new events occur 
our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult  subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements  which could be material  if we used different assumptions or estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment  income taxes and contingent liabilities discussed below  however  as previously disclosed  we made a material change in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for certain interest rate swap and cap agreements 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation 
property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value  remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs 

table of contents we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives  especially those involving our rigs  would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or assets in a specific geographical region 
however  the drilling  workover and related service industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  most of our assets are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the assets being evaluated to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount is not recoverable 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed  or from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some 
table of contents portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income  including where the rigs are expected to be deployed  as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position 
a change in such estimates and assumptions  along with any changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets  liabilities  or valuation allowances as discussed below 
as of december   we have us net operating loss nol carryforwards 
due to our acquisition of marine drilling companies in september  certain nol carryforwards are subject to limitations under sections and of the us internal revenue code 
the us nol carryforwards could expire starting in through we have foreign nol carryforwards and we have recognized a valuation allowance on substantially all of these foreign nol carryforwards 
certain foreign nol carryforwards do not expire and some could expire starting in through we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these unremitted earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
as required by law  we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments  however  we believe the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  we received tax assessments from the mexican government related to our operations for the tax years and these assessments contest our right to claim certain deductions in our tax returns for those years 
we anticipate that the mexican government will make additional assessments contesting similar deductions for other tax years 
while we intend to contest these assessments vigorously  we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome  which may take several years 
however  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these assessments will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as required by local statutory requirements  we have provided standby letters of credit  which totaled million as of december   to contest these assessments 
we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among other things  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate  however  past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims and potential tax assessments see income taxes above 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 

table of contents accounting for interest rate swap and cap agreements we currently use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we have not designated our interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  we must determine the fair value of these agreements and record any changes to the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value is complex and requires significant judgments and estimates  including the methodology of building a forward yield curve  the basis of discounting projected future cash flows and varying conventions in contract terms 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different fair values and could materially affect our results of operations 
segment review in september  based upon changes within our management organization  we changed the composition of our segments to three principal reportable segments offshore  which comprises our offshore drilling activity  currently in africa  the mediterranean sea  the middle east  southeast asia  south america and the gulf of mexico  latin america land  which comprises our land based drilling and workover services in latin america  currently in argentina  venezuela  colombia  bolivia  and mexico  and e p services  which includes exploration and production services in latin america 
other includes revenues and cost for land based drilling and workover operations outside of latin america currently chad  kazakhstan and pakistan  labor contracts and engineering and management consulting services 
the following table presents selected consolidated financial information by reporting segment in millions revenues offshore latin america land e p services other corporate total earnings from operations offshore latin america land e p services other corporate total offshore we have provided below additional information based on the service capabilities of our offshore fleet 
we consider our drillships and our semisubmersible rigs operating in water depths greater than  feet as deepwater and our semisubmersible rigs operating in water depths from  feet to  feet as midwater 
our jackups operate in water depths up to feet 
as of february   our offshore segment comprised two deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  platform rigs  three tender assisted rigs  three barge rigs  and 
table of contents five deepwater rigs managed for other parties 
the following table summarizes our revenue and earnings from operations by type of offshore rig in our fleet in millions revenues deepwater midwater jackups other total earnings from operations deepwater midwater jackups other total the following table summarizes our average daily revenues and percentage utilization by type of offshore rig in our fleet average daily average daily average daily revenues utilization revenues utilization revenues utilization deepwater midwater jackups other average daily revenues are based on total revenues for each type of rig divided by actual days worked by all rigs of that type 
average daily revenues will differ from average contract dayrate due to billing adjustments for any non productive time  mobilization fees  demobilization fees  performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services 
utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period 
excludes rigs managed by us but owned by others 
deepwater revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the increase is due to a increase in actual days worked in as compared to primarily due to a full year of operations in and million related to the amortization of deferred contract liabilities for the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro  increased dayrates for the pride north america  and contractual rate escalations 
average daily revenues for the year ended december  increased over the comparable period in due to contracted dayrate increases for the pride north america and moderate contractual dayrate escalations in for several of our deepwater rigs 
earnings from operations increased million  or  for the year ended december  over the comparable period in due to an increase in revenues partially offset by charges in for settlement of agency relationships on four of the rigs 
the pride south pacific  working offshore west africa  is to begin a new contract at substantially higher rates following the completion of its current contract currently scheduled for april after completion of repairs to the subsea control system  the pride north america began operating offshore egypt in late april under a contract that expires in january in october  the pride north america sustained crane damage as a result of new equipment failure  repairs were completed during the fourth quarter of the pride carlos walter was in the shipyard for its special periodic survey in the fourth quarter of in november  the pride brazil and pride carlos walter were awarded contract extensions beginning in mid through at dayrates approximately higher than current rates 

table of contents utilization remains high  as our deepwater fleet is fully contracted through june much of our deepwater fleet is contracted until mid  as a result  we would benefit from increasing dayrates for deepwater rigs only when our fleet is able to rollover to new contract terms

we have based these statements on our assumptions and analyses in light of our experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was  million and  million  respectively  which was more than its carrying value as of december  and of  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
as of december   we held interest rate swap and cap agreements relating to the drillship loan facility as required by the lenders 
we have not designated these interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging 
table of contents instruments in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the interest rate swap and cap agreements are marked to market with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap and cap agreements was an asset of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we did not enter into any forward exchange or option contracts in and  but continue to monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
