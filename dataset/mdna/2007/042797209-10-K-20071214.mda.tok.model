unless otherwise noted  the term arrowhead research refers to arrowhead research corporation  a delaware corporation formerly known as interactive group  inc  the terms arrowhead  the company  we  us  and our  refer to the ongoing business operations of arrowhead research and its subsidiaries  whether conducted through arrowhead research or a subsidiary of the company arrowhead research  the term arc refers to arrowhead research corporation  a privately held california corporation with which arrowhead research consummated a stock exchange transaction in january  and the term common stock refers to arrowhead research s common stock and the term stockholder s refers to the holders of common stock or securities exercisable for common stock 
the company was originally incorporated in south dakota in  and was reincorporated in delaware in under the name interactive  inc interactive 
on january   interactive consummated a stock exchange transaction with the owners of arc  a privately held california corporation 
this transaction is referred to as the share exchange 
upon consummation of the share exchange  the owners of arc acquired approximately of the common stock of the company 
interactive changed its name to arrowhead research corporation and arc was subsequently dissolved 
the company s principal executive offices are located at south lake avenue  suite  pasadena  california  and its telephone number is as of september   arrowhead research corporation had full time employees at the corporate office and full time employees at its subsidiary companies 
overview arrowhead research corporation is a development stage nanotechnology company commercializing new technologies in the areas of life sciences  electronics  and energy 
arrowhead s mission is to build value through the identification  development and commercialization of nanotechnology related products and applications 
the company works closely with universities to source early stage deals and to generate rights to intellectual property covering promising new nanotechnologies 
arrowhead takes a portfolio approach by operating multiple subsidiaries which allows the pursuit of multiple opportunities and diversifies risk 
currently  arrowhead operates five majority owned subsidiaries the subsidiaries focused on developing and commercializing nanotechnology products and applications and has funded a number of prototype development efforts in leading university labs in exchange for the exclusive right to license the technology developed in such labs 
nanotechnology nanotechnology involves the investigation and design of materials and devices at the atomic and molecular levels 
the engineering of materials and devices at the nanoscale is expected to unleash fundamental paradigm shifts in a range of different industries 
large multinational corporations are investing heavily in commercialization efforts and the federal government has funded an aggregate of billion for nanoscale science and engineering projects since already  nanomaterials are being used to make stain resistant and wrinkle free clothing  lighter and stronger baseball bats  and more durable epoxies and paints 
although nanotechnology is likely to impact virtually every industry ranging from textiles to aerospace  we believe that the most far reaching impacts of nanoscience will be in life sciences pharmaceuticals  electronics  and energy 
nanotechnology is contributing to advancements in life sciences  including applications in drug development and delivery  diagnostics  stem cell therapeutics  and personalized medicine 
recent breakthroughs in life sciences such as the sequencing of the human genome  the discovery of rna interference rnai  and advances in stem cell techniques are enabling new understanding of diseases and approaches to treatments 
nanotechnology involves engineering on a molecular level 
biological processes happen at the molecular scale 
nanotechnology combines the traditional disciplines of chemistry  materials science  physics  and biology and enables the manipulation of matter in powerful new ways 
using the knowledge from all of these disciplines  
table of contents medicines and diagnostic agents are being designed to interact with cells and tissues with a high degree of specificity and functionality 
the electronics industry is leveraging nanomaterials in devices that are faster  cheaper  more flexible  and consume less energy 
electronic materials and devices used over the past several decades have reached their performance limits 
additionally  because traditional electronic materials such as indium tin oxide  copper  aluminum  and silicon are mined  supplies of these materials are finite and subject to shortages 
nanomaterials are likely to be used to enhance the performance of traditional electronic products and to address technological challenges encountered by existing electronics manufacturers 
in energy  nanotechnology is enabling the manufacture of new kinds of solar cells  fuel cells  batteries  and super capacitors 
existing solar cells based on crystalline silicon are bulky and expensive 
if successfully developed  solar cells incorporating nanomaterials could be cheaper  lighter and more flexible 
similarly  nanomaterials could yield new light emitting diodes leds that are brighter and consume less power than existing sources of lighting 
nanostructured materials promise to give rise to new batteries that last longer  have more energy  and are a fraction of the size of conventional batteries 
sponsored research arrowhead is taking advantage of a key trend in technology innovation 
more and more in recent years  fueled by government and private funding  major new discoveries and product inventions are happening at universities rather than in the research and development divisions of large corporations 
universities are patenting and licensing these inventions through technology transfer offices  and academic researchers have become interested in commercialization of their work 
in exchange for the exclusive right to license the technology developed in sponsored laboratories  arrowhead has worked with some of the most outstanding academic institutions in the country  including the california institute of technology caltech  stanford university  duke university and the university of florida  in critical areas such as stem cell research  carbon electronics  and molecular diagnostics 
by funding university research  arrowhead has the ability to ascertain the probability of technical success at relatively low research cost and  if warranted  continue cost effective development at the university by leveraging the existing resources available to scientists at universities  such as laboratories and equipment  as well as operating in an atmosphere that encourages the exchange of ideas 
moreover  the cultivation of relationships in the academic community provides an additional window into other promising technologies 
majority owned subsidiaries arrowhead owns majority interest in its subsidiaries  securing substantial participation in any success 
each subsidiary is staffed with its own technical and business team that focuses on its specific technology and markets  while arrowhead provides financial  strategic  and administrative resources 
the company s five majority owned subsidiaries are focused on developing and commercializing a variety of nanotechnology products and applications  including anti cancer drugs  rnai therapeutics  carbon based electronics  fullerene anti oxidants and compound semiconductor materials 
in the near term  arrowhead expects to add to its portfolio through selective acquisition and formation of new companies

in addition  insert has outstanding warrants  primarily issued in connection with a financing transaction completed in october as of september   assuming all options in each subsidiary plan were awarded and exercised and all warrants were exercised  the company would own approximately of insert  of calando  of unidym  of tego and of aonex 
arrowhead has entered into a funding agreement to provide future additional capital to calando 
the agreement gives arrowhead the right to provide additional capital to calando or to forfeit a specified portion of its interest in lieu of additional future funding 
in deciding whether to make an additional capital contribution  the company looks at such factors as progress toward a milestone and what the management is doing and how management is doing with their spending plan 
the company works closely with the subsidiaries senior management and the decision regarding funding milestones is made well in advance of the milestone date or event 
should calando meet their milestones and the company decides not to fund further  the company would still own a majority of the outstanding voting securities of calando 
the following table summarizes the terms and status of these additional capital contributions subsidiary total capital assuming all contributions made future capital contributions time for additional capital contributions calando pharmaceuticals  inc   months under its agreement to provide additional capital with calando  arrowhead has the right to provide calando up to  in additional capital based upon the achievement of certain development milestones 
the first milestone payment of  is projected to be due during the first quarter of fiscal the last of these milestone payments for  is projected to be due during the fourth quarter of fiscal detail subsidiary discussions at september   insert therapeutics  inc and calando pharmaceuticals  inc were separate subsidiaries 
on october   arrowhead announced that mr 
larry stambaugh was hired as president and chief executive officer of both subsidiaries and that a merger between the two subsidiaries is being pursued 
mr 
stambaugh was also elected to the board of directors of each insert and calando 
for purposes of this k  each subsidiary will be discussed separately 

table of contents insert therapeutics  inc general insert has licensed a proprietary drug delivery platform technology based on a nano engineered class of linear cyclodextrin containing polymers from caltech and has further developed the technology into cyclosert  a proprietary drug delivery system 
cyclodextrins a cyclic sugar molecule have been used with great success for drug delivery  principally acting to solubilize drugs that otherwise would not dissolve 
in polymeric form  cyclodextrins have been shown to be non toxic and non immunogenic 
by enabling the manipulation of particle size and other characteristics of cyclodextrin  insert has been able to improve drug properties and performance 
the cyclosert delivery platform has been designed to be used with a variety of drug molecules and targeting agents 
numerous new drugs attack molecules that are on the surface of cells 
many known molecular targets inside the cell remain undrugable because drugs that could attack these targets cannot successfully cross the cell membrane or be taken up by the cell s natural mechanisms 
by actively inserting a drug payload into cells  cyclosert is designed to provide therapeutic treatment focused on previously unreachable targets 
the linkage between cyclosert and the drug payload can be modified to trigger release of the drug at the appropriate time and in the desired location 
insert s lead anti cancer drug candidate it is a combination of cyclosert and the potent anti cancer drug  camptothecin 
camptothecin is an anti cancer agent that has never been commercialized successfully due its poor solubility  unfavorable pharmacokinetics  and unintended interactions with elements found in human blood 
despite serious side effects  analogs of camptothecin that have been modified primarily to improve their solubility are widely marketed as therapeutics for colorectal  ovarian  and lung cancers 
the combination of camptothecin with the cyclosert polymer has been shown to improve solubility  and to increase circulation time in the body allowing a disproportionate amount of the drug to accumulate in tumors due to the leaky nature of tumor vasculature 
perhaps most importantly  camptothecin is joined to the polymer in a way that facilitates the release of active camptothecin inside the cell 
this provides an advantage over the currently marketed analogs  which begin to chemically transform into a form inactive against cancer but still highly toxic almost immediately upon entering the bloodstream 
insert filed its investigational new drug ind application for it with the food drug administration in february  and commenced its first human clinical trials at city of hope cancer center in july the national cancer institute nci has designated city of hope as a comprehensive cancer center which indicates that this institution has undergone a rigorous peer review process  and has been found to be worthy of this high level of recognition shared by only a few institutions nationwide 
the clinical trial is designed to assess the safety  toxicity  maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of it  with secondary endpoints to assess tumoral response and anti tumor activity 
it is open to patients with non resectable solid tumors who have failed existing standard therapies and who meet other specified criteria 
the clinical trial is ongoing

the oncology market cancer is characterized by rapid  uncontrolled cell division resulting in the growth of an abnormal mass of cells generally referred to as a malignant tumor 
cancerous tumors can arise in almost any tissue or organ  and cancer cells  if not eradicated  can spread  or metastasize  throughout the body 
as these tumors grow  they cause damage to the surrounding tissue and organs and commonly result in death if left untreated 
cancer is believed to occur as a result of a number of hereditary and environmental factors 
according to the american cancer society  cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states and accounts for approximately one in every four deaths 
between  and  americans die of cancer each year 
the national institutes of health estimated the direct medical cost of cancer to be in excess of billion per year 

table of contents it insert s lead product  it  is a chemotherapy drug candidate 
camptothecin  the active ingredient in it  is a member of the topoisomerase i class of chemotherapy drugs 
topoisomerase inhibiters interfere with dna synthesis and eventually lead to cell death 
there are currently two marketed hydrophilic water soluable camptothecin analogs that are based on chemical modifications to the native camptothecin molecule 
irinotecan  which is marketed under the name camptosar  is indicated for treatment of colorectal cancer 
topotecan  which is marketed under the name hycamtin  is indicated for treatment of ovarian and non small cell lung cancers 
these drugs generate annual worldwide sales estimated to be in excess of billion 
it  if approved  would address a portion of this market depending on the approved indication s 
camptothecins are among the most important classes of anti cancer drugs introduced in recent years 
however  the marketed camptothecin analogs pose substantial challenges in terms of efficacy  tolerability and difficulty of use 
insert s objective with it is to provide a product that has enhanced tolerability and anti tumor activity compared with the approved products 
insert commenced phase i clinical trials to evaluate the safety  toxicity and pharmacokinetics of it at the city of hope national cancer center in duarte  california  in july secondary endpoints to be evaluated include anti tumor activity 
insert expects that the trial will be completed in in october  insert s lead anti cancer compound  it  was featured in a public television documentary series produced by thirteen wnet new york and the california institute of technology caltech 
the documentary chronicles the early research on it by dr 
mark davis  the founder of insert therapeutics and professor of chemical engineering at caltech 
the show also follows the progress of the first patient in the it clinical trial 
research and preclinical development insert has invested in the research and development of new product candidates  including those that could extend the application of its proprietary drug delivery technology  cyclosert 
research and development efforts on these pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that any of these compounds will be successful or will progress to clinical trials 
advancing these development candidates into human clinical trials is dependent on several factors  including technological feasibility and commercial opportunity as well as the availability of financial resources 
it is difficult to evaluate the potential markets for these product candidates as the areas of potential application are diverse and specific applications are yet to be determined 
in addition to internal research and development efforts  we may consider acquisitions of other products  development candidates or technologies to expand insert s pipeline and capabilities 
when developing new products  we may consider a variety of factors  including potential pricing and gross margins existing and potential market size high barriers to entry patent expiration dates manufacturing capabilities and access to raw materials potential development and competitive challenges how a potential product will fit within our existing array of products under development  and what synergies may exist 
table of contents collaboration and licensing arrangements insert is internally focused on using its technology to develop and commercialize proprietary conjugates of cyclosert with select small molecule drugs and peptides  initially in the oncology area 
with its ability to deliver a wide range of therapeutic payloads  ranging from small molecules to proteins and peptides  insert s cyclosert technology platform has applications well beyond insert s capacity to develop internally 
consequently  research and development collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to deploy our technology with other therapeutics are continually sought  whether for the purpose of extending the life cycle of currently marketed drugs  or to resolve delivery challenges of new chemical entities 
one investigational drug that insert therapeutics investigated in collaboration with german based r d biopharmaceuticals  uses the cyclosert system to deliver a potent anticancer agent called tubulysin a 
tubulysin a is a naturally occurring substance produced by myxobacteria 
it is highly active against many types of cancer cells  targeting the cellular structures called microtubules  which play a crucial role in cell division 
used by itself  tubulysin a is an effective anti tumor agent  but it is also highly toxic 
by combining it with the cyclosert transport system  researchers are aiming to make it non toxic while preserving its anti tumor activity 
in vitro studies showed the tubulysin cyclosert conjugate to be effective against multiple human cancer cell lines 
the conjugate was found to be stable and times more water soluble than the free drug 
water solubility is essential for efficient delivery of drugs through the bloodstream 
tubulysin a is already better than many comparable agents in this respect  and preclinical studies have shown significant improvement in solubility when tubulysin a is combined with cyclosert 
in trials on animals  the tubulysin cyclosert conjugate was well tolerated  in contrast to tubulysin a alone  which was highly toxic and caused mortality 
the conjugate was also compared to vinblastine  an agent with a similar mechanism of action to tubulysin a 
vinblastine was found to be significantly less effective as an anti tumor agent 
manufacturing insert currently uses  and expects to continue to be dependent upon  contract manufacturers to manufacture each of its product candidates 
insert has established a quality control and quality assurance program  including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications  designed to ensure that its products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing procedures  or cgmps  and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations 
additional manufacturing resources will require additional investment  and insert may seek to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other parties that have established manufacturing capabilities 
insert expects to continue to rely on third party manufacture of its development and commercial products on a contract basis 
currently  insert has agreements with third party vendors to furnish it drug supply for clinical studies 
insert will be dependent upon these third parties to supply it in a timely manner with products manufactured in compliance with cgmps or similar standards imposed by foreign regulatory authorities where our products are tested and or marketed 
competition the healthcare industry in general is characterized by extensive research efforts  rapid technological change and intense competition 
other pharmaceutical companies will compete with insert in areas of research and development  acquisition of products and technology licenses  and the manufacturing and marketing of products that could potentially compete with insert s products 
competition will be based on safety  efficacy  ease of administration  breadth of approved indications  price  reimbursement and physician and patient acceptance 
in addition to the already approved irinotecan and topotecan  other companies are developing camptothecin formulations with a goal of delivering a more effective and tolerable therapy than the approved camptothecin based products 
sonus pharmaceuticals is currently conducting a phase i trials for its sn injectable emulsion camptothecin suspended in a vitamin e emulsion 
mersana therapeutics  inc is currently conducing a phase i clinical trial with a polymer  camptothecin conjugate 

table of contents insert s ability to successfully compete in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries will be based on its ability to do the following create and maintain advanced formulation technologies develop proprietary products attract and retain key scientific personnel obtain patent or other intellectual property protection for products obtain required regulatory approvals manufacture  market and or license our products alone or with collaborative partners insert faces competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology drugs 
insert competes with large pharmaceutical companies and with other specialized biotechnology companies  including but not limited to cell therapeutics  sonus pharmaceuticals  mersana therapeutics  abraxis biosciences  bristol myers squibb co  sanofi aventis  genentech  lilly and novartis 
many of insert s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than insert and have substantially greater experience in developing products  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and manufacturing products 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies 
many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large  well funded research and development programs 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as insert s products 
in addition  other technologies or products may be developed that have an entirely different approach that would render insert s technology and products noncompetitive or obsolete 
intellectual property insert therapeutics has an exclusive  worldwide license from caltech to a suite of us and foreign patents that are pending or have been issued 
insert has also filed its own us and foreign patent applications  which are pending 
insert has licensed its cyclosert delivery technology to an affiliate company  calando pharmaceuticals inc  for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
under the terms of the license  insert received an equity stake in calando 
insert is also entitled to royalties and sublicensing fees on the sales of products covered by the licensing agreement

as of september   insert had employees  all of whom were full time  not including mr 
petrovich who also served as chief executive officer and president of calando until october  calando pharmaceuticals  inc general calando was formed in february to focus on designing  developing and commercializing novel rnai therapeutics to treat diseases and other medical conditions by combining effective rnai therapeutics with patented and proprietary delivery technologies 
calando s delivery technology is one of the family of cyclodextrin containing polymers developed at caltech and licensed to calando for the field of rnai therapeutics by affiliate insert therapeutics 
the delivery technology is augmented by a second technology developed at and licensed from caltech 
rna interference  or rnai  is a naturally occurring mechanism within cells for selectively silencing and regulating specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
rnai is induced by small  double stranded rna molecules 
one method to activate rnai is with chemically synthesized small interfering rnas  or sirnas  which are double stranded rnas that are targeted to a specific disease associated gene 
the sirna molecules are used by the natural rnai machinery in cells to cause highly targeted gene silencing 

table of contents a key roadblock to the therapeutic use of rnai is the lack of an effective delivery mechanism 
sirna is degraded and destroyed in the bloodstream if unprotected and naked sirna is not taken up by cells 
calando s delivery technology binds to and protects sirna from degradation in the bloodstream 
the linear cyclodextrin polymer self assembles with the sirna molecule to form a sirna containing nanoparticle 
with appropriate targeting molecules attached  the sirna is delivered to cells or tissues of interest  taken up by the cell and released inside the cell 
calando has conducted and published results of preclinical studies with various collaborators to test the safety and efficacy of the sirna delivery system and calando s sirna therapeutic candidate 
studies conducted with caltech and the children s hospital of los angeles published in october reported sequence specific  anti tumor effects and conclusive evidence of molecular targeting to and within tumor cells by using calando s delivery system 
in the march proceedings of the national academy of sciences  data was published from a primate study of calando s first therapeutic candidate  cala  which contains the sirna delivery system  calando s proprietary sirna sequence targeting an enzyme necessary for cell replication and a targeting molecule 
the data showed that the formulation was well tolerated at doses significantly higher than those shown to be effective in previous studies using a similar formulation 
additionally  no significant immune response was detected except at the highest dose 
overall  this study shows that multiple  systemic doses of calaa can safely be administered to non human primates  and is the first example of multiple systemic dosing of sirna in monkeys 
calando currently is conducting further preclinical testing for its cala drug candidates and has completed the scale up of the manufacture of its delivery polymer and its proprietary sirna

currently  calando has agreements with third party vendors to furnish calaa drug supply for clinical studies 
calando will be dependent upon these third parties to supply products in a timely manner manufactured in compliance with cgmps or similar standards imposed by foreign regulatory authorities where calando s products are tested and or marketed 

table of contents competition calando is engaged in the rapidly changing business of developing treatments for human disease through the regulation of gene expression 
competition among entities attempting to develop products to treat diseases by regulating gene expression is intense and is expected to increase 
in addition to competitors in the regulation of gene expression field  there are other competitors using other technologies to target the same diseases that we are targeting 
calando faces direct competition from companies engaged in the research  development and commercialization of rna interference based technology  as well as competition from companies attempting other methods of gene expression control 
calando competes with large pharmaceutical companies and established biotechnology firms  many of whom are developing new products to treat the same diseases that calando targets 
in some cases  those companies have already commenced clinical trials for their products 
many of these companies have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than calando does 
calando s collaborators  licensors and potential licensees may be conducting research and development programs using rna interference technology and non rna interference technologies directed at the same diseases that calando is targeting 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in addition  competitors may complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before calando  thus achieving a significant competitive advantage 
a number of companies are pursuing research and development programs related to the emerging area of rna interference 
a number of these companies have filed patent applications in the area of rna interference 
it is difficult to predict whether any of these companies will be successful in obtaining patent protection  whether the patent protection sought will address important aspects of the technology and  to what extent these companies will be successful in their rna interference efforts 
academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for products and clinical development and marketing 
these companies and institutions compete with calando in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel

unidym  inc general unidym  inc is engaged in the manufacture and application of carbon nanotubes cnts  a novel material with extraordinary electrical  thermal  and mechanical properties 
unidym provides cnt enabled products  bulk cnt materials  and intellectual property to a wide range of customers and business partners 
unidym s initial cnt enabled products are transparent electrodes consisting of a thin  transparent film of carbon nanotubes that could replace the expensive  failure prone materials currently employed by manufacturers of such devices as touch screens  flat panel displays  solar cells and solid state lighting 
in addition  unidym has historically provided bulk cnt materials to hundreds of customers primarily for research or early commercial prototyping purposes  and recently has selectively entered into intellectual property licensing arrangements to license its cnt technology to customers or partners in non core markets 
longer term  unidym expects to extend its cnt enabled product offerings to provide electrodes for fuel cells  and thin film transistors for thin film solar and printable electronics applications 
unidym was formed when nanopolaris  a subsidiary of arrowhead research corporation  acquired the assets of an early stage company called unidym  inc nanopolaris was founded to consolidate foundational intellectual property related to carbon nanomaterials 
at the time of the acquisition  nanopolaris had successfully negotiated exclusive commercial rights to nanotechnologies  mostly in the area of carbon nanotubes  developed at the california institute of technology  duke university  pennsylvania state university  state university of new york at buffalo  university of toronto  rensselaer polytechnic institute and tsinghua university 
nanopolaris purchased the assets of the former unidym to gain access to the company s substantial expertise and intellectual property in carbon nanotube films  which may have broad application to the electronics industry 
after its purchase of unidym s assets in june  nanopolaris changed its name to unidym 
in april  unidym merged with carbon nanotechnologies  inc cni of houston  texas  a company founded in by the late dr 
richard smalley of rice university 
dr 
smalley and his collaborators won the nobel prize in chemistry for their discovery of carbon fullerenes  an allotrope or molecular form of carbon closely related to the carbon nanotube 
dr 
smalley s pioneering work led to the development of a suite of more than patents including issued us patents owned or controlled by cni  as well as the development of significant development and manufacturing infrastructure for the production of cnt materials 
since its inception  cni has provided bulk cnt materials to hundreds of customers  primarily for research or early commercial prototyping purposes  and has won research grants from government agencies such as the national institute of science nist and the state of missouri 
with the cni merger  unidym controls an expansive intellectual property portfolio related to cnt technology  with foundational patents covering cnt compositions of matter  synthesis  processing  and applications 
although unidym is currently focused on the electronics industry  its patent portfolio broadly covers many other promising cnt applications  ranging from structural composites  to sensors and to therapeutics 

table of contents competition unidym faces competition from a number of start ups and established companies in the industries it enters 
in the electronics industry  there are a number of start up or private companies that are focused on the application or production of nanotubes including atomate  c nano  eikos  nantero and southwest nanotechnologies 
more established companies with announced cnt programs include brewer sciences  dupont  honeywell  samsung  sumitomo and toray 
there are also potential competitors who are pursuing alternative nanotech based approaches to the markets served by unidym  including the start up cambrios and large japanese companies such as fujitsu 
manufacturing as a result of the recent merger with cni  unidym possesses significant in house manufacturing capability for the production and purification of nanotubes for both electronic and bulk material applications 
unidym also has limited in house capability to produce sample and prototype quantities of cnt based transparent conductive films 
carbon nanotube production and purification unidym can produce different grades of carbon nanotubes in high volume and at low cost 
the houston facility formerly cni has developed two different processes for commercial production high pressure carbon monoxide hipco or mgp and modified gas phase mgp  as well as a new process  modified gas phase mgp which is in the late stages of development and qualification 
by varying production conditions and post processing techniques  unidym is able to produce a wide variety of nanotube grades that are tailored to different markets 
the hipco route is an all gas phase process that mixes catalyst precursor with hot carbon monoxide gas under conditions of high pressure and high temperature 
it produces one wall carbon nanotubes that are best utilized for certain high end products  such as fuel cells 
the mgp process combines the gas phase process with aspects of a supported catalyst route  which is sometimes referred to as a cvd process 
the mgp process is used to produce materials grades required for composite materials and electrostatic discharge protection applications 
the mgp process is a modified version of the mgp process which is used for producing electronics grade materials 
the company is in the latter stages of development and qualification for this new material grade 
manufacturing carbon nanotube based transparent conductive films unidym has capabilities for manufacturing tunable electronic components based on random networks of carbon nanotubes 
first  cnt powders are dispersed in aqueous solutions to produce inks 
the nanotube inks are then deposited on different substrates using high volume  roll to roll manufacturing equipment 
after being deposited  the films are treated and encapsulated to protect them from environmental conditions such as moisture and abrasion 
the nanotube networks can be tuned to provide desirable electrical  mechanical  and optical properties for different electronic applications 
these tunable components include cnt based transparent conductive films for use in transparent electrode applications in such products as touch screens  flat panel displays  solar cells and solid state lighting 
unidym has in house deposition or coating equipment which is used for the deposition of cnts onto plastic or glass substrates in sample quantities 
for early production of transparent conductive films  unidym expects to engage with subcontractors toll coaters who have existing high volume  high quality roll to roll capacity which has historically been used in the production of films for the motion picture or still photography industries 
the company expects that given the abundance of these subcontractors and the availability of subcontract capacity  there will be no need to bring production capacity in house for the near or intermediate term 
however  the company expects to continually evaluate the quality and costs of its subcontract toll coaters  and may decide to bring such production in house if it is advantageous to the company to do so 

table of contents marketing and sales revenue is expected to be generated through direct product sales and license deals into relatively consolidated industries 
as a result  unidym intends to have a relatively small in house business development team and will leverage the sales force and relationships of its distribution  development and production partners 
unidym has recently hired a vice president of business development and marketing who has more than years of executive level experience in the electronics industry who will lead the company s business development  sales and marketing efforts 
the company currently has a distribution relationship with the large japanese trading firm  sumitomo  for the distribution of its cnt materials in asia 
unidym expects to also use similar distributors to assist in the distribution of its cnt based transparent conductive films 
intellectual property unidym controls an expansive intellectual property portfolio covering cnt technolgy  with foundational patents covering cnt compositions of matter  synthesis  processing  and applications 
although unidym is currently focused on the electronics industry  its patent portfolio broadly covers many other promising cnt applications  ranging from structural composites  to sensors and to therapeutics 
key personnel arthur swift is president and ceo of unidym and has over years of senior management experience in the semiconductor industry 
previously  mr 
swift was president and ceo of transmeta corporation  an innovative semiconductor company in the silicon valley 
ralph j 
harms is the chief financial officer who brings to unidym a wealth of financial management experience  in both private and public technology companies 
ralph has experience in building the infrastructure necessary to successfully deal with the intricacies of technology manufacturing and licensing businesses 
robert bismuth is vice president of business development marketing and has a track record of innovative business success in both building strategic relationships and in bringing to market new applications for a wide range of technologies

tego biosciences  inc general tego biosciences corporation tego was formed to acquire the assets of c sixty  inc in april tego is focused on developing and commercializing products for the health care industry based on modified buckministerfullerenes also known as fullerenes or buckyballs 
tego s product candidates include therapeutic skin creams  cancer therapies  and drugs targeting central nervous system disorders 
tego is also exploring the use of modified fullerenes as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri 
fullerenes are a highly structured  nanoscale form of pure carbon  similar to carbon nanotubes 
roughly one nanometer in diameter  a fullerene molecule is comprised of carbon atoms and has the symmetry of a soccer ball 
the spherical shape  hollow interior  and carbon atoms of the molecule allow drug designers the opportunity to attach therapeutic and targeting chemical groups in many configurations 

table of contents research and development initially  tego does not intend to hire staff to develop these products 
rather  for the first eighteen months  the company intends to use third parties to do most of the development work with a small staff located in houston  texas  to oversee the progress and to direct collaborations and licensing of the intellectual property 
collaborations and licensing the preclinical studies for the chemotherapy protection product will be performed in the national cancer institute s nci nanotechnology characterization lab ncl to measure the ability of a tego fullerene formulation to protect against harmful side effects of two anti cancer drugs  cisplastin and adriamycin 
the first stage of the studies will use ncl s resources  with follow on funding from tego  as appropriate 
the national cancer institute  working in concert with the national institute of standards and technology nist and the us food and drug administration fda  established the nanotechnology characterization laboratory ncl 
cancer 
gov to perform preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing of nanoparticles 
the ncl serves as a national resource and knowledge base for all cancer researchers to facilitate the regulatory review of nanotechnologies intended for cancer therapies and diagnostics 
by providing the critical infrastructure and characterization services to nanomaterial providers  the ncl can accelerate the transition of basic nanoscale particles and devices into clinical applications  thereby reducing suffering and death from cancer 
licenses and collaborations for the other product targets will be pursued over the course of the next fiscal year 
competition tego is competing with other companies developing fullerene products as well as alternatives to fullerene products 
there are several companies that manufacture and sell fullerenes and fullerene formulations  including frontier carbon corporation mitsubishi subsidiary and nano c 
there are also companies developing fullerene based therapeutics  including luna nanoworks and vitamin c bioresearch mitsubishi subsidiary 
there are a variety of other technologies that tego must compete with in commercializing its fullerene based products 
for example  other compounds can be used as antioxidants in therapeutic skin creams 
additionally  there are many different technologies being developed to improve cancer therapy and treat central nervous system disorders 
there are also a variety of novel mri contrast agents under development 
manufacturing tego does not initially intend to manufacture and market its products directly 
rather  it is pursuing a strategy of partnering  licensing  and outsourced manufacturing 
intellectual property tego has a patent protected fullerene platform that forms the basis for several products 
the company s intellectual property assets include exclusive licenses to issued patents and patent applications from siemens and washington university 
key personnel on october   dr 
russ lebovitz was appointed ceo of tego to chart the strategic direction and guide the operations of the new nano biotechnology company 
dr 
lebovitz served previously as ceo of c sixty  inc  the company that pioneered the technology now owned by tego

aonex technologies  inc general aonex technologies is developing engineered wafers to enable manufacturers of blue and white leds to reduce their production costs and create higher efficiency devices 
the market for blue leds is currently billion and expected to grow to billion by blue and white leds are manufactured by depositing or growing gallium nitride and its alloys onto sapphire substrates at high temperatures 
while relatively inexpensive  sapphire poses two challenges to device manufacturers 
first  it is an electrical and thermal insulator which means that it must be removed following device growth in order to create high efficiency ie  vertical device structures 
second  it expands at a different rate than gallium nitride as the temperature is changed a material property termed coefficient of thermal expansion or cte resulting in high levels of stress and wafer bow during and after the growth process 
this latter limitation is the primary obstacle that prevents the industry from moving to larger wafer sizes to reduce costs 
aonex s engineered wafers are comprised of thin films of materials suitable for led fabrication that have been bonded onto specially engineered support wafers using a proprietary process 
by optimizing the support wafer s properties  aonex is able to simplify the manufacture of high efficiency led structures  improve yields  and offer a viable path to larger wafer sizes and corresponding lower costs 
aonex has performed testing of prototypes of its products and is shipping samples to potential partners 
collaboration and licensing arrangements after analyzing the existing competition and scale required for success in its core markets  aonex has opted to seek an established company with which to partner in its future commercialization efforts 
in such a partnership  aonex would provide the technology developed to date while the larger partner would provide resources and the product stream 
this change of strategy will likely limit the return that arrowhead is able to achieve on its investment in aonex 
intellectual property aonex has licensed a suite of intellectual property from caltech in exchange for the issuance to caltech of a warrant to purchase  shares of aonex common stock for nominal consideration 
this license agreement provides aonex with exclusive  worldwide rights to certain patents and patent applications filed by caltech 
in addition  aonex believes it possesses adequate intellectual property rights in a number of key areas of engineered substrates for compound semiconductor device production 
key personnel harry atwater is a founder of aonex and is chairman of aonex s scientific advisory board 
dr 
atwater is the howard hughes professor of applied physics and materials science at caltech and possesses over years of experience in aonex s core technologies 
professor atwater holds bs  bs and bs degrees from mit 
sean olson is the president of aonex 
mr 
olson has both technical and business experience in the semiconductor industry and is a veteran of both early and late stage ventures 

table of contents aonex s board of directors is comprised of sean olson  harry atwater  r 
bruce stewart who also serves as executive chairman of arrowhead  and edward w 
frykman  who also serves as a director of arrowhead 
as of september   aonex had one full time employee 
discontinued operations as part of arrowhead s model  the company will open or close subsidiaries based upon the success of the subsidiary 
the company closed one subsidiary  nanotechnica  during fiscal the subsidiary is shown in the line loss on discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
nanotechnica  inc in the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the progress being made by nanotechnica in commercializing microfluidics technology was not progressing satisfactorily and the market potential was uncertain 
as a result  on june   a majority of the stockholders of nanotechnica voted to dissolve the company 
because of arrowhead s liquidation preference as the holder of nanotechnica s series a preferred stock  million in cash was remitted to arrowhead along with  of the other remaining assets 
arrowhead has discontinued development efforts related to microfluidics and returned the applicable patents to caltech 
the losses incurred by nanotechnica are segregated in the consolidated statement of operations as loss from operation of discontinued nanotechnica  inc nanotechnica generated no revenues 
sponsored research as of september   arrowhead had two sponsored research agreements with the california institute of technology and unidym had one with duke university and one with university of florida 
for each research agreement  the researchers focus their efforts on achieving certain mutually agreed upon goals 
arrowhead monitors the progress of the research  guides the researchers toward commercially viable prototypes  and works with the researchers in developing an intellectual property portfolio and commercialization plan for the technologies 
in exchange for funding the research  the company has the right to exclusively license and commercialize any technology developed as a result of the research 
california institute of technology in september and october  the funding for two sponsored research projects at the california institute of technology were cancelled when we determined that the research would not lead to near term commercialization 
under the terms of the agreement  upon notice of termination  caltech will not make any further commitments and take reasonable action to terminate existing commitments 
the company is responsible for any outstanding commitments that cannot be cancelled 
the company does not expect to incur any material costs in connection with the termination of the agreements 
duke university nanoscale interconnects for integrated circuit dr 
jie liu and his team of researchers at duke university are developing a process for fabricating new nanoscale interconnect materials in integrated circuits 
interconnects  which are metallic wires that carry electric power in computer chips  are currently made of copper 
resistance and electro migration in copper interconnects cause problems in smaller integrated circuits 
the momentum from moving electrons can cause atoms to move from their original positions leading to gaps in the connection 
as a result  progressively smaller integrated circuits made with copper interconnects have reduced reliability  lose one or more connections  or can even cause failure of the entire circuit 

table of contents the liu group is using carbon nanotubes to replace copper wires 
carbon nanotubes can carry larger current densities  have lower resistance  and may be more stable than copper at certain smaller size scales 
metallic nanotubes have a current carrying capacity of one billion amps per square centimeter while copper wires burn out at one million amps per square centimeter 
at this time  one model demonstrates that  when bundles of tens of micrometer long densely packed nanotubes with small contact resistances are used  nanotubes can be faster than copper wires at the nm node 
the rights and obligations of the sponsored research agreement between the company and duke were transferred to unidym prior to unidym s acquisition of carbon nanotechnologies  inc the terms of the agreement provide for annual funding of approximately  to fund dr 
liu s work from december through november university of florida flexible electronic devices dr 
andrew rinzler and his group at the university of florida are developing flexible electronic devices 
thin film transistors tfts could be used to make products such as low cost rfid radio frequency id tags  flexible displays  and electronic paper 
further  unlike state of the art electronics manufacturing facilities which cost billions of dollars  flexible electronics are likely to be produced with low cost ink jet printing technologies 
according to estimates from nanomarkets  the total market for products based on thin film transistors could reach over billion by companies seeking to commercialize thin film transistors have primarily focused on organic transistors 
organic transistors have not  however  demonstrated the mobility and lifetimes necessary for device integration 
dr 
rinzler s team uses carbon nanotubes to make thin film transistors 
in addition to having high carrier mobility  nanotubes can be deposited at low temperatures on most substrates directly from solutions 
transistors comprising nanotubes are robust  air stable  and can be bent substantially 
the rights and obligations of the sponsored research agreement between the university of florida and the company were transferred to unidym prior to unidym s acquisition of carbon nanotechnologies  inc the terms of the agreement provide for  in funding over a two year period from july through june to develop optimized tft devices and prototypes of tft arrays 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we are a development stage company and we have limited historical operations 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
the following is a summary of certain risks we face 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
certain risk factors relating to the company s focus on nanotechnology there are substantial inherent risks in attempting to commercialize new technological applications  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop nanotechnology for commercial use 
the company finances research and development of nanotechnology  which is a new and unproven field 
the company s research scientists are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance is unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes an extremely long time to reach commercial viability  if at all 
to date  the company s research and development projects have not produced commercially viable applications  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  the company may experience technological barriers that it may be unable to overcome 
for example  our scientists must determine how to design and develop nanotechnology applications for potential products designed by third parties for use in cost effective manufacturing processes 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that none of our potential applications will be successfully developed 
if the company is unable to successfully develop nanotechnology applications for commercial use  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our applications to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development yields technologically feasible applications  the company may not successfully develop commercial products  and even if it does  it may not be on a timely basis 
if the company s research efforts are successful on the technology side  it could take at least several years before this technology will be commercially viable 
during this period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced or customer needs may change  which will diminish or extinguish the commercial uses for our applications 
because nanotechnology is an emerging field  the degree to which potential consumers will adopt nanotechnology enabled products is uncertain 
the company cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for nanotechnology enabled products will develop  if at all  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
if markets fail to accept nanotechnology enabled products  we may not be able to generate revenues from the commercial application of our technologies 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new technological applications to manufacturers for products accepted by customers 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among original equipment manufacturers and customers  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
the company may not be able to effectively secure first tier research and development projects when competing against existing or new ventures 
management believes that the company s success to date in raising capital to finance nanotechnology research and commercialization projects can be largely attributed to the fact that the plan of operations adopted by the company is relatively novel 
if the company continues to be successful in attracting funding for research 
table of contents and commercialization projects  it is possible that additional competitors could emerge and compete for such funding 
should that occur  the company could encounter difficulty in raising funds to finance its future operations and further research and commercialization projects 
additionally  a substantial number of companies fund early stage  scientific research at universities  and many venture capital firms and other institutional investors invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
it is possible that these companies  which may be more established and have greater resources than we do  and venture funds and institutional investors  as well as possible additional competitors  have financed or will begin to finance nanotechnology research 
should that occur  the company may not be able to secure the opportunity to finance first tier research and commercialization projects 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by the company prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
the company does not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from its technologies on a mass scale 
unless the company expands its product development capacity and enhances its internal marketing  the company will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if the company does not find appropriate partners  or if its existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  the company s ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if the company is able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event the company pursues its commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of attendant technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to company proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without the company or design around the company s intellectual property  the company may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
nanotechnology enabled products are new and may be viewed as being harmful to human health or the environment 
there is public concern regarding the environmental and ethical implications of nanotechnology that could impede market acceptance of products developed through these means 
nanotechnology enabled products could be composed of materials such as carbon  silicon  silicon carbide  germanium  gallium arsenide  gallium nitride  cadmium selenide or indium phosphide  which may prove to be unsafe or harmful to the environment because of the size  shape or composition of the nanostructures 
for this reason  these nanostructures may prove to present risks to human health or the environment that are different from and greater than the better understood risks that may be presented by the constituent materials in non nanoscale forms 
government authorities in the united states or individual states  and foreign government authorities could  for social or other purposes  prohibit or regulate the use of some or all nanotechnologies 
the regulation and limitation of the kinds of materials used in 
table of contents or used to develop nanotechnology enabled products  or the regulation of the products themselves  could halt or delay the commercialization of nanotechnology enabled products or substantially increase the cost  which will impair our ability to achieve revenue from the license of nanotechnology applications 
we have entered into technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective  and if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we have entered into exclusive  long term license agreements with rice university  california institute of technology  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our proposed products 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we cannot give any assurance that sales of products incorporating these technologies will be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
failure by us to satisfy our obligations under these agreements may result in the modification of the terms of the licenses  such as by rendering them non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our products  including the manufacture of calando s and insert s product candidates 
while we try to have at least two sources for each component and process  we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
therefore  it is possible that the business plans of the company will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we may be unable to scale up our manufacturing processes in a cost effective way 
in some cases  nanotechnology will require new technological and manufacturing processes that  at this time  are very expensive and subject to error 
there is no assurance that technology and manufacturing processes will expand and improve quickly enough to enable the company s targeted products to be made within rigorous tolerances cost effectively 
if manufacturing and mass production are not available at a favorable cost  the company s technology may not be adopted by the applicable industry 
under such scenario  the company may not achieve its business plan for one or more processes or products  which could adversely impact the value of our common stock 
the company will need approval from governmental authorities in the united states and other countries to successfully realize commercial value from the company s activities 
in order to clinically test  manufacture and market products for commercial use  two of the company s current subsidiaries must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies  including the us food and drug administration fda 
technology and product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the time and expense required to perform the necessary testing can vary and is substantial 
in addition  no action can be taken to market any biologic  drug or device in the united states until the fda approves an appropriate marketing application 
furthermore  even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further trials may be required to obtain additional data on safety and effectiveness 
adverse events that are reported during regulatory trials or after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on a product s use and  potentially  withdrawal of the product from the market 
any adverse event  either before or after approval  can result in product liability claims against the company  which could significantly and adversely impact the value of our common stock 

table of contents if export controls affecting our products are expanded  our business will be adversely affected 
the us government regulates the sale and shipment of numerous technologies by us companies to foreign countries 
arrowhead s subsidiaries may develop products that might be useful for military and antiterrorism activities 
accordingly  us government export regulations could restrict sales of these products in other countries 
if the us government places burdensome export controls on our technology or products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
if the us government determines that we have not complied with the applicable export regulations  we may face penalties in the form of fines or other punishment 
our research and product development efforts pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry are subject to additional risks 
two of our subsidiaries  insert and calando  are focused on research and development projects related to new and improved pharmaceutical conjugates 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
even product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early animal and human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results are not acceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the fda  did not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution is uneconomical 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
if insert and calando are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of their respective biopharmaceutical technology  or if the associated drug products do not achieve wide market acceptance  the businesses of insert and calando will be materially and adversely affected  and the value of the company s interest in these subsidiaries will diminish 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
the company s operations  including its research and development and its commercialization efforts  such as clinical trials  manufacturing and distribution  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices  we cannot assure you that the company or its employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations or laws  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a commercialized product  significant fines  sanctions  or litigation  any of which could harm our business and financial condition 
the technology licensed by the company s subsidiaries from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license technology from caltech  rice university  and other universities and companies 
our licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our collaborators often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our collaborators limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 

table of contents the company s ability to protect its patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing it to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
the company s subsidiaries have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and will continue to file patent applications 
the researchers sponsored by the company may also file patent applications that arrowhead chooses to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior  or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or the company s technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment in the company may decline 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
third parties may claim that our potential products or related technologies infringe their patents 
any patent infringement claims brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a patent covering a third party s intellectual property unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property 
we may be unable to obtain these rights on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain rights to a third party s patented intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive and  therefore  our competitors may obtain access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
we may not be successful integrating operations of unidym s california and texas locations 
our subsidiary  unidym  through its wholly owned subsidiary  unidym acquisition llc  merged with texas based carbon nanotechnologies  inc cni through a reverse triangular merger on april  management may fail to successfully integrate the two companies or realize the expected benefits from the merger 
additionally  it is possible that the merger will have a negative impact on unidym s ability to sell carbon nanotubes  commercialize electronic products incorporating carbon nanotubes  and generate revenue 
unidym may be unable to obtain access to carbon nanotubes from other suppliers that may be better suited for unidym s electronic products 
similarly  unidym may lose existing customers or fail to secure prospective customers if those customers believe that unidym s plan to manufacture electronic products incorporating carbon nanotubes represents a competitive threat 
it is also possible that the costs required to integrate the two companies will be greater than expected 
it is anticipated that  in the immediate future  both the houston  texas  and menlo park  california  facilities will continue to operate 
management will be required to supervise and coordinate activities at two facilities in different states 
there may be unanticipated redundancies in the capital equipment and research efforts at each facility 
researchers and product managers at different facilities may not effectively communicate  and the cultures and work environments may differ between facilities 

table of contents certain risk factors relating to the early stage of the company s business we are a development stage company and the company s success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
the implementation of the company s business strategy is still in the development stage 
we have acquired majority interests in five subsidiary companies and  through unidym  one university research project at duke university and one university research project at the university of florida 
the company s business and operations should be considered to be in the development stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
accordingly  the intended business and operations of the company may not prove to be successful in the near future  if at all 
any future success that the company might enjoy will depend upon many factors  several of which may be beyond the control of the company  or which cannot be predicted at this time  and which could have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition  business prospects and operations of the company and the value of an investment in the company 
the company has not generated significant revenues and its business model does not predict significant revenues in the foreseeable future 
to date  the company has only generated a small amount of revenue as a result of its current plan of operations 
moreover  given its strategy of financing new and unproven technology research  we do not expect to realize significant revenue from operations in the foreseeable future  if at all 
failure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
further  as our subsidiaries businesses grow  we will be required to manage multiple relationships 
any further growth by us or our subsidiaries  or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships will increase this strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
this strain may inhibit our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to implement our business plan  and could have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition  business prospects and operations of the company and the value of an investment in the company 
our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our subsidiaries 
as our subsidiaries grow  the administrative demands upon the company will grow  and our success will depend on our ability to meet these demands 
these demands include increased accounting  management  legal services  staff support and general office services 
we may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands  the cost and quality of which is dependent in part on market factors beyond our control 
further  we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we must overcome the many obstacles associated with integrating and operating varying business ventures to succeed 
arrowhead s model to integrate and oversee the strategic direction of various subsidiaries and research and development projects presents many risks  including the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel  and the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently design and integrate administrative and operational support for our subsidiaries  we may be unable to manage projects effectively  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our business objectives and the value of an investment in the company could decline 

table of contents in addition  consummating acquisitions and taking advantage of strategic relationships could adversely impact our cash position and dilute stockholder interests for many reasons  including changes to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred to fund our growth strategy  and any issuance of securities to fund our operations or growth  which dilutes or lessens the rights of current stockholders 
neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries have confirmed the value of their assets or business by an independent valuation 
the company is a development stage company and our assets consist mainly of intellectual property  rights and contracts 
the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market and the trading price of our common stock has served as a baseline valuation for arrowhead research 
however  neither the company  on a consolidated basis  nor any subsidiary has sought an independent valuation for their businesses or assets 
traditional methods of valuation include a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
the company has not generated a positive cash flow to date and does not expect to generate significant cash flow in the near future 
additionally  the company does not believe that there exist comparable public companies to provide a meaningful valuation comparison 
arrowhead research s subsidiary investments were the result of negotiation with subsidiary management and equity holders  but the investment valuations were not independent verified 
accordingly  arrowhead research may have invested in its various holdings at higher or lower valuations than an independent source would have dictated 
therefore  there may be no correlation between the investment valuations used by arrowhead research over the years for its investments and the actual market values 
if arrowhead should eventually sell all or a part of any of its consolidated business or that of a subsidiary  the ultimate sale price may be for a value substantially lower or higher than previously determined by arrowhead  which could materially and adversely impair the value of our common stock 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the near future  and  if we are unable to secure adequate funds on acceptable terms  the company may be unable to support its business plan 
the company s plan of operations is to provide substantial amounts of research project funding and financial support for majority owned subsidiaries over an extended period of time 
accordingly  the company may need to raise additional capital in the near term  and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities  selling additional securities in a registered public offering  or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that any additional capital resources needed by the company will be available to the company as and when required  or on favorable terms that will be acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to raise the capital required on a timely basis  it may not be able to fund its research projects or the development of the businesses of its subsidiaries 
in such event  the company may be required to delay or reduce implementation of certain aspects of its plan of operations 
stockholder interest in the company may be substantially diluted in additional financings by the company 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of common stock  on such terms and at such prices as the board of directors of the company may determine 
as of december    shares of common stock were issued and outstanding 
as of december    shares and  shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under arrowhead s stock option plan and equity incentive plan  respectively 
as of december   options to purchase  shares were outstanding under the stock option plan and options to purchase  shares were outstanding under the incentive plan 
as of december   the company had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock that are callable by the company under certain market conditions 
the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by the company or 
table of contents through the exercise of options or warrants would dilute the equity interests of the company s existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
the company s success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
the company s future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of its key employees  particularly mr 
r 
bruce stewart  executive chairman of arrowhead  who conceived the company s business and overall operating strategy and has been most instrumental in assisting the company to raise capital 
in addition  the company relies on several key executives to manage each of our subsidiaries 
the company does not maintain key man life insurance for mr 
stewart or any other executive 
the company s ability to execute its strategy also will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists  sales  marketing and additional managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
certain risk factors relating to our stock arrowhead s common stock price has fluctuated significantly during fiscal  and and may continue to do so in the future 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our nanotechnology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  developments in our strategic relationships with scientists within the nanotechnology field  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding nanotechnology as the next technological wave  announcements regarding developments in the nanotechnology field in general  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and quarterly variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and any extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
the market for purchases and sales of the company s common stock may be very limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  currently  our securities are relatively thinly traded 
accordingly  it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 

table of contents if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business  of if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or securities analysts 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive coverage from analysts 
if no industry or securities analysts commence coverage of our company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain industry or security analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price would likely decline 
if one of more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about our company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of shares by the company s management or founding stockholders 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and founding stockholders could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of those securities 
additionally  the price of arrowhead s common stock could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
furthermore  due to relatively low trading volume of our stock  should one or more large stockholders seek to sell a significant portion of its stock in a short period of time  the price of our stock may decline 
we may be the target of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders until and unless we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is inherently unpredictable  and you should not plan on it occurring in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  the company s board of directors  without further action by the company s stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock 
as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview arrowhead is a development stage nanotechnology company commercializing new technologies in the areas of life sciences  electronics  and energy 
arrowhead s mission is to build shareholder value through the identification  development and commercialization of nanotechnology related products and applications 
the company works closely with universities to source early stage deals and to generate rights to intellectual property covering promising new nanotechnologies 
arrowhead takes a portfolio approach by operating multiple subsidiaries each a subsidiary  and  collectively  the subsidiaries which allows the pursuit of multiple opportunities and diversifies risk 
currently  arrowhead operates five majority owned subsidiaries focused on developing and commercializing nanotech products and applications and has funded a number of prototype development efforts in leading university labs in exchange for the exclusive right to license the technology developed in such labs 
majority owned subsidiaries arrowhead owns majority interest in its subsidiaries  securing substantial participation in any success 
each subsidiary is staffed with its own technical and business team that focuses on its specific technology and markets while arrowhead provides accounting  financial  strategic  and administrative services 
the company s five majority owned subsidiaries are commercializing a variety of nanotech products and applications  including anti cancer drugs  rnai therapeutics  carbon based electronics and compound semiconductor materials 
in the near term  arrowhead expects to add to its portfolio through selective acquisition and formation of new companies 
sponsored research in exchange for the exclusive right to license the resultant technology developed in sponsored laboratories  arrowhead and or its subsidiaries have worked with some of the most highly regarded academic institutions in the country  including the california institute of technology caltech  stanford university  duke university and the university of florida  in critical areas such as stem cell research  carbon electronics and molecular diagnostics 
by funding university research  arrowhead and or its subsidiaries has the ability to evaluate the probability of technical success at low research cost and  if warranted  continue development at the university by leveraging the existing resources available to scientists at universities  such as laboratories and equipment  as well as operating in an atmosphere that encourages the exchange of ideas 
moreover  the cultivation of relationships in the academic community provides an additional window into other promising technologies 
subsidiaries at september   the company had five majority owned  operating subsidiaries  insert therapeutics  inc insert  calando pharmaceuticals  inc calando  unidym  inc 
unidym  formerly nanopolaris  inc  tego biosciences corporation tego and aonex technologies  inc aonex 
as part of its model  the company will create subsidiaries to commercialize promising technologies or close subsidiaries based upon lack of progress of the subsidiary 
insert has developed cyclosert  a proprietary drug delivery platform technology based on a nano engineered class of linear cyclodextrin containing polymers 
it  insert s first therapeutic candidate  is a conjugate of insert s patented nano engineered drug delivery polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer compound 
insert s investigational new drug ind application for it was accepted by the us food and drug administration fda in march a phase i study for it began in the summer of at the city of hope cancer center 
interim results from the trial were reported in june the trial is expected to be completed in 
table of contents calando is designing  developing and commercializing novel rnai therapeutics to treat diseases and other medical conditions by combining effective rnai therapeutics with patented and proprietary delivery technologies 
calando s first therapeutic candidate is designed for the treatment of cancer 
calando expects to file an ind application in early unidym is developing high performance  cost effective carbon nanotube based products for the electronics industry 
through license of intellectual property from several universities and by virtue of its april merger with texas based carbon nanotechnologies  inc cni  unidym has assembled exclusive commercial rights related to carbon nanotube manufacture and applications 
the merger also provided unidym with the ability to manufacture carbon nanotubes on a larger scale 
unidym s initial product is a transparent conductive film designed to replace the expensive and brittle metal oxide films currently used in electronic products like flat panel displays  touch screens  oleds and thin film solar cells 
in addition to its product development efforts  unidym manufactures and sells carbon nanotubes to customers and has entered in joint development agreements to incorporate its carbon nanotube films into existing products 
on april   tego biosciences corporation  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of arrowhead  acquired the assets of c sixty  inc  a texas based company developing protective products based on the anti oxidant properties of fullerenes 
initially  tego is collaborating with the national cancer institute s nanotechnology characterization lab ncl for preclinical studies to measure the ability of a tego fullerene formulation to protect against harmful side effects of two anti cancer drugs  cisplastin and adriamycin 
the first stage of the studies used ncl s resources 
in october  arrowhead invested million into tego to fund the development of various uses for fullerenes 
aonex is developing engineered wafers to enable manufacturers of blue and white leds to reduce their production costs and create higher efficiency devices 
after analyzing the existing competition and scale required for success in its core markets  aonex has opted to seek an established company with which to partner in its future commercialization efforts 
aonex is continuing to develop its technology in a phase down mode while it explores possibilities for collaboration with other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition revenue from product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence exists that an arrangement existed  title had passed and delivery has occurred  the price was fixed and determinable  and collection was reasonably assured 
we may generate revenue from product sales  technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  and research grants 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically 
table of contents consists of nonrefundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
revenue associated with up front license fees and research and development funding payments  under collaborative agreements  is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
revenue from substantive milestones and future product royalties is recognized as earned based on the completion of the milestones and product sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  trial including pre clinical  clinical and other and manufacturing costs  purchased in process research expenses  contract and other outside service fees  and facilities and overhead costs related to our research and development efforts 
research and development expenses also consist of costs incurred for proprietary and collaborative research and development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on quoted fair market values 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill if any for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the single reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
intellectual property intellectual property consists of patents and patent applications internally developed  licensed from universities or other third parties or obtained through acquisition 
patents and patent applications are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  and any impairment found is written off 
licensed or internally developed patents are written off over the life of the patent unless impairment occurs 
purchased patents are written off over three years  unless an impairment occurs sooner 
results of operations the company had a consolidated loss of approximately million for the year ended september   compared to a consolidated loss of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a gain of million applicable to the sale to third parties of a portion of arrowhead s ownership in insert  thereby reducing the loss for fiscal by the same amount 
the increase in the fiscal consolidated loss over fiscal and fiscal adjusted for the one time gain in fiscal occurred in several areas 
first  staffing continues to increase as the company grows 
with the phase up of unidym starting in july of and the merger with cni in april  staffing has almost 
table of contents doubled 
staff was added within insert and calando to accommodate the increase in development efforts of new products and of the ind to be filed by calando 
staff was added in fiscal to handle the increase in general  accounting and administrative responsibilities as the company has grown and to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended sox 
second  calando incurred major expenses during fiscal related to preclinical research  preparation for the filing of its investigational new drug application ind with the us food and drug administration  fda  to obtaining sufficient drug inventories to be able to enter phase i clinical trials  and payment for preparation required to enter the trials 
third  legal expenses increased as the company completed the merger with cni  a private placement for insert and a private placement for arrowhead 
the increased loss in fiscal was also the result of a non cash million charge to purchased in process research and development to account for the purchase of cni  increased expenses in unidym related to the establishment of the menlo park location and the addition of the texas operations  and expenses related to insert s continuation of phase i clinical trials and preparation for phase ii clinical trials with insert s drug candidate  it  and preparation for phase i clinical trials for calando s drug candidate calaa revenues the company generated revenues of  for the year ended september   compared to  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the revenue for fiscal consists of  of funded research for the development of carbon nanotube applications and  from the sale of carbon nanotubes to third parties as a result of the merger with cni and  in residual funded research 
the revenue in fiscal and fiscal was for funded research and for a license and development payments paid to calando by a third party 
operating expenses the analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the company within the major categories 
for purposes of comparison  the amounts for the three years ended september   and  are shown in the tables below

salary wage expenses arrowhead employs management  administrative and technical staff at the arrowhead corporate offices and the subsidiaries 
salary and wage expense consists of salary  benefits  and non cash charges related to equity based compensation in the form of stock options 
salary and benefits are allocated to two major categories general and administrative compensation related expense  research and development r d and a small portion of salaries and wages is allocated to cost of goods sold  beginning in  depending on the primary activities of each employee

during this four year period  the company started aonex april  nanopolaris april  calando february  nanotechnica september and closed in june  acquired insert june and unidym june and merged unidym with nanopolaris july and later merged with carbon nanotechnologies  inc april arrowhead also acquired the intellectual property of c sixty april now held in the name of tego biosciences corporation june 
the merger with cni added about employees to the payroll in april in fiscal  the company accrued the cost of the severance approximately million to be paid to two executives upon their departure from the company over periods ranging from one to three years 
this charge is non cash until paid but is included in g a compensation for fiscal in january  the company recruited a president and ceo for insert  who left insert at the end of may in november  a new president and ceo was hired for insert and calando 
in june  the company recruited a president and ceo for unidym 
g a related compensation in fiscal when compared to fiscal is the result of hiring and subsequent departure of a president for arrowhead and the associated severance 
in addition to the cost associated with the former president and his severance  the corporate office incurred additional costs associated with the hiring of one additional executive to support the company and the subsidiaries in the areas of sox implementation  financial analysis and budgeting in march in may  arrowhead s ceo pay was adjusted upward by the compensation committee 
prior to that time  the ceo was paid a nominal amount to accommodate the company s start up status while the company obtained financing and began operations 
prior to january  the president of insert calando was a consultant 
beginning in january  he became a full time employee 
both insert and calando hired administrators in fiscal which further added to the increase in fiscal in december  the company hired a new president and chief executive officer 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company and its subsidiaries also had performance reviews and increased the pay of existing employees where warranted 
these increases contributed to the growth in salary expense over the three year period 
stock based compensation is a non cash charge related to the issuance of stock options to new and existing employees and the vesting of these options 
this expense is recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas r which requires expensing of stock based compensation for all options granted 
stock options are awarded to new full time employees and to existing employees 
while the number of options has increased overall  this number will vary from year to year depending on hiring  on terminations and on awards to new and existing employees 
research and development r d compensation expense increased each fiscal year as the company has grown 
however  the primary factors which led to growth in fiscal was the june acquisition of 
table of contents unidym and subsequent ramp up of development activities  as well as the april merger with cni and the resulting consolidation with its texas operations under unidym 
in addition  technical staff was added at insert and calando to increase the scope of development at each subsidiary 
the expense was partially offset by the termination of several employees at aonex early in fiscal the company expects that salaries and wages will continue to grow in fiscal as more people are hired to support development within the subsidiaries 
general administrative expenses the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for each of the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category professional outside services recruiting facilities related patent expense travel expense business insurance depreciation g a communications and technology office expense others total professional outside services include general legal  accounting  and other outside services retained by the company and its subsidiaries

legal expenses for fiscal include expenses applicable to the merger with cni approximately  and a private placement for arrowhead and legal expenses related to a financing by insert including a million follow on investment by arrowhead 
recruiting expense increased dramatically due to the payment of approximately  to hire a president for insert in the first quarter of fiscal and the payment of approximately  in the second quarter of fiscal related to the search for a president for unidym 
recruiting fees are expected to continue as the company builds out its management team  but the cost is not predictable at this time 
the company incurred additional expense for new or expanded leases as subsidiaries were established or expanded in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily related to the company s move to larger corporate offices in march  and the move of insert into new laboratory facilities in june in addition  calando moved in july into the facility previously occupied by insert which increased calando s rent expense 
in june  the company purchased the assets of unidym and established office and lab facilities for unidym 
facilities related expenses remained stable in fiscal and are expected remain stable in fiscal patent expenses for the last two fiscal years remain constant but the mix has changed 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to the patent portfolio acquired by the company was a result of the cni merger 

table of contents the large dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the establishment of nanopolaris now called unidym and the gathering of patents from various universities related to carbon nanotubes and a retro active billing by caltech k related to the patents that insert has for the delivery system 
with the growth of the company through mergers and acquisitions  the company now has multiple locations in california  texas and new york city 
the increased travel among those locations has resulted in a significant increase in travel expense in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal in addition  the employees have traveled to europe and asia in pursuit of collaborations and agreements 
the company continues to pursue increased public and investor relations activities  and new business initiatives 
travel expense can be expected to increase in the future 
insurance increased as a result of increases in limits and coverage as the company has grown 
for instance  the director and officer insurance coverage was increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal the company incurred this expense in anticipation of attracting new executive management to the company and its subsidiaries 
in addition  insert has additional insurance as a result of its entry into clinical trials in fiscal and calando is expected to have the same expense in fiscal as it enters clinical trials 
the company will continue to see this expense increase as the company grows 
the primary reason for the decrease in depreciation was completion of the write off of aonex leasehold improvements in june it is our policy to write off leasehold improvements over the initial term of the lease even when the lease is later extended 
research and development expenses the bulk of arrowhead s r d expenses for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were related to research and development activities by arrowhead s subsidiaries 
currently  arrowhead operates five majority owned subsidiaries  each focused on development and commercialization of nanotechnology products or applications and has funded a number of sponsored research efforts in leading university labs in exchange for the exclusive right to license the technology developed in such labs 
each subsidiary is staffed with its own technical team that focuses on its specific technology and markets while arrowhead provides financial  strategic and administrative resources 
the following table details r d expenses for the three fiscal years ended september   and in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category outside labs contract services in process r d purchased   n a n a laboratory supplies services facilities related sponsored research depreciation r d other research expenses total 
table of contents outside labs contract services involves work done on behalf of the subsidiaries 
using contract services allows each subsidiary to keep its cost of development to a minimum  only hiring those people that it will need in the long run 
therefore  this expense can increase or decrease depending on the need of each subsidiary 
these expenses have increased significantly over the past three years  primarily due to insert s phase i clinical trials of it  calando s preparation for the anticipated initiation of clinical trials and to the full year that unidym has been operating 
further  continued growth in the company through mergers  acquisitions and formation of new subsidiaries could increase this number in the future 
increased outside labs and contract services expense for insert and calando in fiscal over fiscal are due to outsourced preclinical studies for pipeline candidates for insert  outsourced preclinical studies in preparation for the filing of an ind application filing by calando  outsourced manufacture of calando s therapeutic candidate for preclinical and clinical studies and regulatory consulting for the ongoing clinical trials by insert and for the preparation of the ind filing by calando 
unidym incurred similar expense related to the outsourcing of process development 
fluctuations in this expense category have been experienced in previous periods and can be expected to continue due to the differences in the demands of the development plans from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the increase in laboratory supplies and services and facilities related expenses over the same periods in prior years is primarily related to the commencement of the development effort for the transparent conductive film by unidym starting in june from inception until the june acquisition of the net assets of unidym  nanopolaris which subsequently changed its name to unidym  inc was primarily involved in the identification and licensing of intellectual property related to the manufacture and use of carbon nanotubes and had no employees 
starting in february  unidym rented laboratory space in menlo park and incurred expense to set up the lab 
laboratory supplies and facility expense related to unidym s texas facility also contributed to the increase in the expense for the year ended september  the build out and move of insert s offices and labs and the move of calando into the lab previously occupied by insert also contributed to the expense  as did the increase in rent at both facilities 
on march   insert received approval for its ind application from the fda for its lead anti cancer therapeutic  it and began phase i clinical trials in the third quarter of calendar in advance of the clinical trials  insert was required to pay the cost to manufacture the entire amount of it necessary to complete animal trials in fiscal and phase i clinical trials which started in fiscal it is the company s policy to expense the cost of the supplies and services when received even if they may benefit subsequent years 
laboratory supplies services remained fairly constant in fiscal and fiscal the cost of the supplies and services expensed in both years was approximately million 
while insert was beginning phase i clinical trials  calando was beginning large mammal studies 
while the purchase of supplies and animal studies of this magnitude is not a normal recurring expense  the continued development of new products in the subsidiaries will result in increased r d laboratory supplies and services in the future 
in fiscal  purchased in processed r d represents the cost incurred for the cni unidym merger in excess of the value of identifiable tangible and intangible value of assets at the time of the merger 
cni s focus has been on the development of manufacturing processes and applications for carbon nanotubes 
the timing and estimated costs to complete project and estimated cash flows are impossible to determine 
in connection with the merger  certain shareholders assumed million of cni s debt in exchange for million of restricted arrowhead common stock 
in addition  unidym series a preferred stock with an estimated value of million was issued in exchange for all the outstanding stock in cni 
the total amount of consideration for the cni merger  estimated at million  was expensed to purchased in process r d 
in fiscal  the company accounted for the acquisition of minority interests of calando as a purchase of in process research and development 
arrowhead purchased  shares of calando s common stock from various minority shareholders for an aggregate price of  in fiscal the purchases were made through a series of transactions during the year 
payment for the shares included a total of  in cash and  of arrowhead common stock 

table of contents facility related expense increases in fiscal was primarily the result of leasing offices and lab space for unidym in menlo park  california and the merger of unidym and cni in april in addition  calando is paying more for its new space which it occupied just prior to the beginning of fiscal sponsored research expense increased slightly in fiscal over fiscal and fiscal the company has added two sponsored research projects that were not in place at september  as part of the merger with cni  unidym has taken over the payments  rights and responsibilities related to the sponsored research projects at duke and at the university of florida 
subsequent to the year ended september   the company decided to cancel the two sponsored research projects at caltech pursuant to the provisions of the respective sponsored research agreements 
use of outside labs and contract services allows the subsidiaries access to equipment which is expensive to buy and which may not be needed on a regular basis 
arrowhead encourages its subsidiaries to purchase assets when justified and to use outside services when possible to limit investment in capital equipment 
this mode of operation keeps the depreciation low as a percentage of total cost 
the table below sets forth the approximate amount of arrowhead s cash expenses for research and development projects at each subsidiary for the periods described below 
name of subsidiary project project expenses for year ended september  project expenses for year ended september  project expenses for year ended september  project expenses from inception of project through september  calando pharmaceuticals  inc calaa million million million million insert therapeutics it million million million million unidym  inc thin film carbon nanotubes million million million aonex technologies  inc wafer fabrication million million million million tego biosciences corporation fullerene anti oxidants total of all listed subsidiaries million million million million calando pharmaceuticals  inc calando s lead product candidate  calaa  is a formulation containing calando s proprietary drug delivery technology with a sirna duplex targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a well established cancer target 
calando is preparing an investigational new drug ind application for filing with the fda and expects to begin its first clinical trial in calando s research and development efforts on calaa are preliminary  and there is no assurance that this compound will be successful 
advancing this development candidate into human clinical trials is dependent on fda review and approval of calando s ind application 
research and development expenses related to calaa are reflected in the tables above 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of calaa  the completion date  or when revenue will commence 
if calando meets its milestone objectives see note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for an explanation of those milestones  it should have sufficient capital to fund its operations until the end of the second quarter of fiscal insert therapeutics  inc insert was purchased by the company in june insert s primary asset was a license from caltech for patents and other intellectual property for the use of cyclodextrin polymers in drug delivery applications 
in fiscal  insert continued research and development of its anti cancer therapeutic it  which uses the technology covered by the caltech patents 
it is a conjugate of the cyclodextrin polymer and the anti cancer agent  camptothecin 
on march   insert s ind application for it was accepted by the fda and insert began a phase i clinical trial at the city of hope in the third quarter of calendar 
table of contents to build its pipeline of products  insert has investigated conjugates of the cyclodextrin delivery molecule as well as two other potent anti cancer agents  epotholones and tubulysins  and a steroid treatment for chronic inflammation 
insert is also preparing for phase ii trials of it research and development expenses related to it are reflected in the tables above 
insert s research and development activities related to it and other pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of it  the completion date  or when revenue will commence 
unidym  inc arrowhead founded the company now operating as unidym in april since inception  the company has aggregated intellectual property related to carbon nanotube manufacturing and product applications 
the portfolio has been built through licensing of patents and other intellectual property from various universities  through sponsored research  and by the acquisition of unidym  inc  a ucla spin out developing transparent electrodes  and a merger with cni  a texas based company manufacturing and selling carbon nanotubes and developing products containing carbon nanotubes 
unidym is currently generating revenue by producing and selling carbon nanotubes  and is anticipated to generate additional revenue by continuing to produce and sell products and product applications using carbon nanotubes and by licensing technology to third parties beginning in to months 
in connection with the merger  in exchange for arrowhead common stock valued at million  arrowhead acquired preferred stock in cni originally issued to certain shareholders in exchange for their assumption of cni s debt in the amount million 
in connection with the merger  unidym also issued  shares of series a preferred stock valued at million for all of the outstanding stock of cni 
unidym wrote off approximately million to purchased in process r d 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of research and development expenses above 
also in connection with the merger  arrowhead accelerated a planned capital contribution of  to unidym 
development  manufacturing  and sale of cost effective electronic products incorporating carbon nanotubes will require significant investment and take a long time 
there are a variety of technical  cost  and marketing barriers that must be overcome 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final cost of developing unidym s transparent conductive film or other carbon nanotube products  the final cost of scaling up the manufacturing process for cost effective production of carbon nanotubes for products  or when or if unidym will generate significant licensing revenue or become profitable 
subsequent to september   unidym closed a private placement for approximately million 
unidym currently has sufficient cash to operate through fiscal at the current rate of cash consumption 
tego biosciences corporation in april  tego biosciences corporation tego was formed to acquire the assets of c sixty  inc tego is focused on developing and commercializing products for the health care industry based on modified buckministerfullerenes also known as fullerenes or buckyballs 
tego s product pipeline includes therapeutic skin creams  cancer therapies  and drugs targeting central nervous system disorders 
tego is also exploring the use of modified fullerenes as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri 
initially  tego does not intend to expand its internal staff to develop these products 
rather  for the first eighteen months  the company intends to use third parties to do most of the development work with a small staff located in houston  texas  to oversee the progress and to direct collaborations and licensing of the intellectual property 
a new president and ceo was appointed effective october  at the same time  the company invested million in tego to enable the subsidiary to contract development with third parties 
aonex technologies  inc aonex is currently seeking a partner to help in the continued development of blue and white leds 
aonex engineers wafers that are comprised of thin films of materials suitable for fabrication of blue and white leds  
table of contents and that have been bonded onto specially engineered support wafers using a proprietary process 
by optimizing the support wafer s properties  aonex is able to simplify the manufacture of high efficiency led structures  improve yields  and offer a viable path to larger wafer sizes and corresponding lower costs 
aonex has performed testing of prototypes of its products and is shipping samples to potential partners 
research and development expenses related to aonex wafers are reflected in the tables above 
aonex continues to build and ship product but in a phase down mode 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of aonex development efforts  the completion date  or when revenue will commence 
factors affecting further r d expenses the company expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as it adds personnel  expands its pre clinical research  begins clinical trial activities  and increases its regulatory compliance capabilities 
the amount of these increases is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing and extent of progress in the company s research programs 
as the company s research efforts mature  it will continue to review the direction of its research based on an assessment of the value of possible commercial applications emerging from these efforts 
in addition to these general factors  specific factors that will determine the eventual cost to complete the current projects at insert and calando include the following the number  size and duration of clinical trials required to gain fda approval  the costs of producing supplies of the drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
it is possible that the completion of studies could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in enrolling patients  delays in manufacturing  incomplete or inconsistent data from the pre clinical or clinical trials  and difficulties evaluating the trial results 
any delay in completion of a trial would increase the cost of that trial  which would harm the company s results of operations 
due to these uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature nor timing of the costs to complete  or the amount or timing of the net cash inflows from insert or calando s current activities 
until the company obtains further relevant pre clinical and clinical data  it will not be able to estimate its future expenses related to the subsidiaries programs or when  if ever  and to what extent  the company will receive cash inflows from resulting products 
sponsored research in fiscal  the company continued to sponsor research at caltech commencing in october  stanford commencing in june  duke commencing in december and the university of florida commencing in august the number of research projects can fluctuate as the company adds or terminates projects 
for instance  two sponsored research projects at caltech were terminated in the first quarter of fiscal these projects were replaced by sponsored research agreements at duke university and the university of florida so while the mix has changed  the dollars expended are about the same 
as the company grows  sponsored research is expected to increase as more opportunities are identified 
as part of the merger of unidym and cni  the duke and florida sponsored research projects were transferred from arrowhead to unidym 
it is believed that results from these sponsored research projects are directly applicable to the ongoing development efforts at unidym  so the rights and obligations should be borne by unidym 
subsequent to september   the two projects at caltech were cancelled as the company did not see any near term benefits to continuing the research 
the research agreement with stanford ended in may 
table of contents consulting consulting fees total approximately  for fiscal of the total year to date consulting fees  approximately  was incurred at unidym   at insert  and  at calando 
unidym incurred approximately  in consulting fees related to manufacturing processes for carbon nanotubes and an additional  for business strategy and technical consultation 
one consultant was paid approximately  to develop a process for manufacture of sheets of thin film nanotubes 
temporary help in houston to support development and manufacture of carbon nanotubes cost an additional  cost related to thin film transistors was about  insert incurred approximately  in business strategy consulting and travel related expenses including  paid to mr 
jacobs for consulting services prior to his employment at insert full time as its president and ceo on january  the major expense in this area was approximately  spent in the third quarter of fiscal for strategic planning and marketing 
mr 
jacobs left at the end of may and this expense was reduced as insert was still conducting clinical trials and did not as yet have a product 
insert also incurred an additional  for regulatory k  clinical trials k and scientific consulting k for fiscal calando incurred approximately  for regulatory work related to the filing of an ind with the fda k  scientific consulting k and clinical consulting k 
in fiscal  consulting fees consisted of  paid for strategic business and governance consulting  acquisition related consulting of approximately  professors non employee subsidiary founders of approximately  advisory board fees of about  and approximately  for consultants for regulatory and clinical trial services in fiscal  consulting fees consisted of approximately  paid for strategic business and governance consulting  to caltech professors non employee subsidiary founders of approximately  director and advisory board fees were about  and technical consulting of approximately  the use of consultants with diverse backgrounds enabled the company to accomplish various objectives without having to add full time staff 
leveraged technology and revenue strategy arrowhead continues to follow its strategy to leverage technology which is being or has been developed at universities 
by doing so  arrowhead benefits from work done at those universities and through majority owned subsidiaries  which can commercialize the most promising technologies developed from sponsored research and other sources 
although the company is likely to produce prototypes and develop manufacturing processes  other than carbon nanotubes  it may not ultimately manufacture products developed 
the company has three primary strategies to potentially generate product sales revenue license the products and processes to a third party for a royalty or other payment 
by licensing  the company would not be required to allocate resources to build a sales or a production infrastructure and could use those resources to develop additional products 
retain the rights to the products and processes  but contract with a third party for production 
the company would then market the finished products 
this approach would require either the establishment of a sales and distribution network or collaboration with a supplier who has an established sales and distribution network  but would not require investment in production equipment 
build production capability in order to produce and market the end products 
this last approach would likely require the most capital to build the production  sales and distribution infrastructure 

table of contents on a case by case basis  the company will choose the strategy which  in the opinion of management  will generate the highest return for the company 
on april   unidym and cni merged 
unidym then had the manufacturing capability to make carbon nanotubes which it uses internally for product development and sells externally to third parties 
prior to this merger  the only revenue generated by the company was through grants from public and private entities and through one licensing deal 
while the ultimate goal of the company is to generate revenue through the sale of products and or the licensing of technology  the company does record revenue from grants and from development fees 
revenue from grants and development fees are considered to be reimbursements for efforts performed on behalf of third parties and not part of the company s primary strategy to generate revenue 
unidym generated combined revenues from grants and sales of carbon nanotubes totaling approximately  in fiscal the remaining revenue of  was from a remaining calando grant 
in fiscal  calando generated approximately  in revenue applicable to a license with benitec ltd 
for the combination of calando s polymeric rna interference rnai delivery technology with benitec s rnai based therapeutic for the hepatitis c virus hcv 
the license was signed in june and called for a upfront fee of  per year and reimbursement for development expenses that calando incurred on benitec s behalf 
the fee was paid in fiscal at which time calando booked the revenue 
on july   the license agreement with benitec was terminated by mutual agreement 
also in fiscal  aonex recognized revenue of about  related to an sbir grant and other research fees 
during fiscal  arrowhead was told by the small business administration that it no longer qualified as a small business because it could not show that of its shareholders were us citizens or legal resident aliens 
therefore  the company does not expect to receive any small business funding in the future 
in fiscal  the bulk of the revenue approximately  came from grants insert received prior to being acquired by arrowhead 
in addition  calando generated about  from the benitec license and aonex had about  applicable to the sbir grant 
except for the sale of carbon nanotubes  the company does not expect any product sales in fiscal therefore  losses can be expected to increase before any substantial revenue is generated 
to partially offset these losses  the company is pursuing other means of funding such as licenses  contracts and collaborations with third parties 
the award of such grants and contracts depends on numerous factors  many of which are not in the company s control and  therefore  it is difficult to predict if this strategy will be successful 
liquidity and capital resources since inception in may  the company has incurred significant losses 
as of september   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  the company s investment objectives are primarily to preserve capital and liquidity and secondarily to obtain investment income 
the company invests excess cash in certificates of deposit  us government obligations and high grade commercial paper 
the company s operating activities have required significant amounts of cash 
this trend will continue through fiscal as the company s subsidiaries continue to develop and refine their products and technology 
during this period the company does not expect to generate significant amounts of revenue 
it is projected that the company and its subsidiaries will continue to add staff  property  and equipment during fiscal in addition  the company expects to continue to invest in new sponsored research projects and new business opportunities 
at september   the company had the right to provide  in its sole discretion  an additional million to calando if certain milestones are reached at specified times 
these capital commitments will be used for research and development  for business development and salaries 
the remainder of the cash will be used to fund ongoing operations 
the company believes that the cash on hand at september   is sufficient to meet all existing obligations and fund existing operations in fiscal 
table of contents since inception  the company has funded operations and acquisitions through the issuance of equity 
as of september   the company had raised approximately million through the sale of common stock and the exercise of warrants 
new business opportunities may require additional cash resources 
in the future  the company may seek additional funding through public or private financing  through collaborations and or through private and us government grants 
except for copy machines  the company does not lease any equipment and purchases all of its required capital assets 
to date  when leasing facility space  the company has been successful in having most leasehold improvements paid for by the landlord and included in the lease cost 
the company may not be able to do so in all cases going forward 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have and have not had any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not generally been a material factor affecting our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in the periods shown 
management does not believe that inflation will be a material factor in fiscal  even though our general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and facilities costs are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual commitments as of september  are summarized below by category in the following table total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligation sponsored research the sponsored research obligations in the table above include our commitments to duke university  the university of florida and caltech 
two sponsored research projects at caltech were cancelled in october and december item a
