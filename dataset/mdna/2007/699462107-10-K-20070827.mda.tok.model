pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating interest 
each legal entity owned by the company and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference

the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the company regularly evaluates its exposure to such changes 
the company s overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates the company derived approximately of its consolidated service revenue for the fiscal year ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in british pounds and approximately was denominated in euros 
the company derived approximately of its consolidated service revenue for the fiscal year ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in british pounds and approximately was denominated in euros 
the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
the company may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts or incur liabilities denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary s functional local currency 
to the extent the company is unable to shift the effects of currency fluctuations to its clients  foreign exchange fluctuations as a result of currency exchange losses could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has a derivative hedging policy to hedge certain foreign denominated accounts receivable and intercompany payables  as well as variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
under this policy  derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts totaled approximately million at june  occasionally  the company enters into other foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations 
these foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into as economic hedges  but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes as defined under sfas the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was approximately million at june  the potential change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended  and  the company recorded foreign exchange gain of million and a loss of million  respectively 
the company acknowledges its exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge program  but quantification of this risk is very difficult to assess at any given point in time 
interest rates the company s exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the level of short term and long term debts and marketable securities 
short term debts were approximately million at june  and approximately million at june  long term debts were approximately million at june  and approximately million at june  marketable securities were at june  and million at june  in connection with the borrowings under our credit facilities in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  the company entered into interest rate exchange agreements to swap  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
these hedges are considered perfectly effective since the critical terms of the debt and the interest rate exchange match and the other conditions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are met 
the mark to market values of both the hedge instrument and underlying debt obligations are recorded as equal and offsetting amounts in interest expense 
the company had interest rate exchange agreements with a notional amount of million at june
