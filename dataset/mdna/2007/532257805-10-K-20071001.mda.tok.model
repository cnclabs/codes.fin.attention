subsequent events in july we raised gross proceeds of approximately million by way of the sale of newly issued common stock and warrants to certain institutional and private investors 
professional fees of  were paid netting the proceeds to us of   shares of common stock were sold at per share 
the net proceeds from the offering will be utilized for new product development  equipment expenditures and working capital to support the continued growth of the business 
the investors also received warrants with an exercise period of five years beginning on january  for the future purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share 
if all of the warrants are ultimately exercised an additional million will be raised 
montauk securities acted as exclusive placement agent and financial advisor 
we have received a letter from one of the investors that purchased  of common stock issued in the offering demanding rescission of their investment and reimbursement of indemnification of the investor for its expenses incurred in connection with transaction 
the demand is based on the investor s allegations that we failed to disclose facts material to the investor in making its investment decision  for example alleged omissions related to the termination of the employment of our chief executive officer and our financial condition  and breached certain representations and warranties set forth in the securities purchase agreement executed with respect to the transaction 
we believe there is no factual basis for the investor s claims and have responded to the investor rejecting the demand 
we are unable to determine what further action  if any  the investor will take with regard to its claims  including whether the investor will pursue its claims through litigation  which we would vigorously defend 
a registration statement on form s will be filed with the securities and exchange commission to register under the securities act of the shares sold in this private placement including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 

table of contents on september  we announced the resignation of our president and chief executive office  kenneth brizel 
he also resigned as a director on that date 
we also announced the appointment of j 
james gaynor as interim chief executive officer effective september  liquidity and capital resources history from february when our ipo occurred to fiscal  inclusive  we raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock 
we did not have any equity or debt financing transactions in fiscal  however in fiscal  and we raised approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in private placements 
our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning fiscal  which continued through fiscal and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our products over that period 
beginning in and continuing in fiscal  we believe that some improvement occurred in demand for our products in several of our markets 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal we have developed our operating plan for fiscal and forecasted revenues and cash flows 
we believe we currently have adequate financial resources for implementation and achievement of our fiscal operating plan and to sustain operations as currently conducted in the coming year 
cash flows cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal during the course of fiscal  we had one time expenses of approximately million  caused by glass yield issues  overtime for direct labor  travel for engineering and management to resolve issues at our shanghai facility  and freight and duty expenses 
we anticipate lower glass costs  as we move to suppliers in asia  by replacing an internally fabricated material with purchased materials  improving our cash flow in future years 
poor glass yield resulted in higher than expected ending inventory but will be used in future periods 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash used by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections which we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include  but are not limited to  a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth  increased material costs  increased labor costs  planned production efficiency improvements not being realized  increases in property  casualty  benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending  particularly sales and marketing related 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs 
should that occur  the realizability of certain assets  especially inventory  property and equipment  intellectual property and other intangible assets may be such that significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements would be required 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity 
these capital expenditures did not include the previously contemplated purchase of an anti reflective coating machine 
management decided to postpone the purchase of the coating machine pending further review 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at lower levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
in july we raised gross proceeds of approximately million by way of the sale of newly issued common stock and warrants to certain institutional and private investors 
professional fees of  were paid netting the proceeds to us of   shares of common stock were sold at per share 
the net proceeds from the offering will be utilized for new product development  equipment expenditures and working capital to support the continued growth of the business 
the investors also received warrants with an exercise period of five years beginning on january  for the future purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share 
if all of the warrants are ultimately exercised an additional million will be raised 
montauk securities acted as exclusive placement agent and financial advisor 
we have received a letter from one of the investors that purchased  of common stock issued in the offering demanding rescission of their investment and reimbursement of indemnification of the investor for its expenses incurred in connection with transaction 
the demand is based on the investor s allegations that we failed to disclose facts material to the investor in making its investment decision  for example alleged omissions related to the termination of the employment of our chief executive officer and our financial condition  and breached certain representations and warranties set forth in the securities purchase agreement executed with respect to the transaction 
we believe there is no factual basis for the investor s claims and have responded to the investor rejecting the demand 
we are unable to determine what further action  if any  the investor will take with regard to its claims  including whether the investor will pursue its claims through litigation  which we would vigorously defend 

table of contents key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
that is followed by sampling them small numbers of the product for their test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit all of their source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog going forward  sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for us 
disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q 
table of contents our disclosure backlog at june  was million 
comparing fiscal to fiscal our backlog at the end of fiscal was higher in communications products  due to an increase in orders and higher than normal delinquent delivery rate 
due to market conditions  throughout fiscal new communications orders were lower 
we believe the downward trend in the disclosure backlog was principally caused by a slow down in telecommunications orders in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year and we expect it to continue through fiscal inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average in comparison  our days cost of sales in inventory at june  was  comparing to at june  we believe this upward trend in inventory was principally caused by a build up of inventory in our china facility based in shanghai 
we expect inventory levels to decline through fiscal as we ship the current inventory on these orders 
accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average 
table of contents in comparison  our days sales outstanding at june  was  compared to at june  we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as possible but no higher than we have noticed an increase in dso as more of our revenues are from international customers who tend to take longer to pay 
the table below presents certain of our significant contractual obligations as of june  the operating leases relate to real estate and are commitments that are expensed as paid per the terms of the related contracts 
contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in s payments due by period comments contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease  real estate lease with monthly payments capital lease equipment lease with monthly payments note payable equipment financing line of credit term note open purchase obligations current purchase orders outstanding year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase was attributable to increases in sales of aspheric lenses partially offset by decreases in sales of isolator and collimator product sales 
the increase in sales of aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line 
in our operating plan for fiscal we expected to see continued revenue gains in aspheric lenses while collimators and isolator sales are expected to remain at current levels 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is a decrease over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this decrease was caused by several factors 
among them  shifting production volumes of molded optics to our china facility  moving more production to lower cost glass and manufacturing of holders in house 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in china and higher yields due to a more experienced workforce in shanghai 
over the course of fiscal  as our manufacturing has shifted to asia  we have reduced our headcount in orlando from down to going further now into first quarter of fiscal we have reduced orlando to employees 
by moving a majority of our manufacturing to asia we should be able to eliminate wasted office space within the orlando location 
we anticipate reducing the space requirements during fiscal and by more than  delivering considerable saving in our overhead 
based on this expected decrease in costs our operating plan projects higher gross margin levels in fiscal than we achieved in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased stock compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock issued in october during fiscal we have reduced expenses by a voluntary reduction in executive and board compensation 
this is planned to continue into the first half of fiscal our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease  primarily caused by a reduction in our workforce in orlando 
our intent is to manage the orlando workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal increased by approximately  to approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to increased materials cost and labor for our china engineering staff 
our operating plan for fiscal projects some increases in new product development spending in order to support increased quote and customer design activity as well as continued investment in new product projects 

table of contents in fiscal our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal this decrease was due to certain of our patents becoming fully amortized in early fiscal interest expense increased by approximately  to  of income from approximately  of expense in fiscal this is primarily due to a  equipment line of credit being converted to a three year note in february other income decreased by approximately  to  of income from approximately  of income in fiscal  due to interest earned on lower cash balances 
net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of approximately  this  improvement in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin improvement of  g a stock compensation expense increases of  higher material costs for new product development of  reduced amortization expense of  year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately  or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase was attributable to increases in aspheric lenses offset by decreases in isolator and collimator products 
the aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is an increase over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this increase was caused by several factors 
among them  overtime costs to increase production volumes for molded optics  startup costs associated with the shanghai facility and lower plant utilization due to product mix changes 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and higher yields from statistical process control applications 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional wages and compensation related expenses offset by reductions in depreciation expense  insurance expense and legal fees 
new product development costs in fiscal were consistent with fiscal at approximately million in fiscal this modest increase of  was primarily due to increased outside services and small tooling costs 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the most significant component of our identified intangibles subject to amortization relates to the developed technology molded aspheric lenses from our acquisition of geltech in fiscal that asset was determined to have a four year life at the time of the acquisition  which was accounted for by the purchase method 
that amortization ended after the first quarter of fiscal other income and expenses increased by approximately  to  of income from approximately  of expense in fiscal the increase during fiscal was partially due to the fact that we entered into a line of credit to fund capital equipment purchases in fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of approximately  this  improvement in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin decrease of  g a wage increases of  and depreciation and amortization reduction of  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves  valuation of deferred taxes  revenue recognition and valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our critical and significant accounting policies are described in note of our financial statements in item the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable  is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over past due from due date and of the total of invoices that are over past due from due date 

table of contents inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished lenses  isolators  collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
inventory costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we have applied statement of financial accounting standards no 
inventory costs fas to our value of inventory 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period not capitalized into inventory 
also unusual or abnormal costs  primarily relating to the start up of the china facility have been expensed 
the inventory obsolesce reserve is calculated by reserving for items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply 
we also reserve for slow moving items within the last months and for low material usage in the last six months 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on the basis of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
revenue is generally recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer  provided that lightpath has received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products to the customer 
stock based compensation is recognized following the guidelines of sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
prior to july   the company applied the disclosure only provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company applied apb  accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its plans and  accordingly  did not recognize compensation expense for these plans because the company issued options at exercise prices equal to the market value at date of grant 
effective july   the company adopted sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  at the date of grant 
sfas r allows the use of either the modified prospective method or the retrospective recognition method 
the company elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted shares beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
for all unvested options outstanding as of july   and subsequently granted options  the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  will be recognized on a straight line basis in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining vesting period 
sfas r requires that the company estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment  which is recognized in the period of change  and also impact the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas 
sfas provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas it also allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued  or subject to a remeasurement new basis event occurring for fiscal years beginning after september  we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no   fair value measurement sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the impact of sfas on its consolidated financial position and results of operations to be material 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin is effective for the first interim period beginning in fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin those will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the company does not expect the impact of fin on its consolidated financial position and results of operations to be material 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
management is currently evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on the company s financial statements  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf 
fsp eitf specifies that registration payment arrangements should play no part in determining the initial classification and subsequent accounting for the securities to which they relate 
fsp eitf requires the contingent obligation in a registration payment arrangement to be separately analyzed under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimations of the amount of a loss 
if payment in a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated  a liability should be recorded 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this fsp will have on the on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations however  we do not believe that the adoption of fsp eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest a portion of our cash reserves in a money market fund  which invests at least of its net assets in securities issued by the us treasury and in related repurchase agreements 
the money market fund is not protected under the fdic  however  we have not experienced any losses in these funds 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates of up to either up or down will have any material effect on our results of operations
