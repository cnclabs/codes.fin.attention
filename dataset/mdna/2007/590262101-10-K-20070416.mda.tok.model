the company believes that while its wireless subscriber base continues to grow  the recent economic downturn  resulting in reduced spending by wireless telecommunications service providers  has caused many wireless telecommunications equipment manufacturers to delay or forego purchases of the company s products 
the company expects that its defense and satellite customers should continue to maintain their approximate current levels of orders during fiscal year  though there are no assurances they will do so 
nevertheless  in times of armed conflict or war  military spending is concentrated on armaments build up  maintenance and troop support  and not on the research and development and specialty applications that are the company s core strengths and revenue generators 
accordingly  our defense and military product sales may decrease and should not be expected to increase  at times of armed conflicts or war 
the company also anticipates increased levels of orders during fiscal year for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research 
fmi is working to restore orders for automotive and defense applications that were delayed in the company incurred an operating loss in due to declines in the microwave micro circuitry segment s defense orders that had been expected to renew in and reduced orders from delays in space and defense programs for the electronic components and subsystems segment 
the company has made and will be making operating changes to filtran to stimulate their sales growth and reduce their costs 
the company has also reduced the cost structure of the electronic components and subsystems segment due to the order delays discussed above 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when the company will become profitable again 
because of the declining level of orders and sales  the company reduced its headcount by persons  principally involved in production  manufacturing support  sales and administration 
the company recorded personnel restructuring charges of  consisting of severance and certain other personnel costs  during the fourth quarter of the company anticipates annual savings of  to begin in the first quarter of from the restructuring and other cost reduction and containment measures to be implemented 
recently the company became aware of a problem with purchased material that was utilized in certain products 
the company has evaluated the material and found the problem with the material does not affect the functionality and reliability of the products 
this problem did cause shipment 
table of contents delays of approximately  of products that were expected to be sold in the first quarter of the delay in shipments will have a significant negative impact on the results of operations for the first quarter of cost of sales for the company consists of materials  salaries and related expenses  and outside services for manufacturing and certain engineering personnel and manufacturing overhead 
our products are designed and manufactured in the company s facilities 
the company s manufacturing and production facilities infrastructure overhead are relatively fixed and are based on its expectations of future net sales 
should the company experience a reduction in net sales in a quarter  it could have difficulty adjusting short term expenditures and absorbing any excess capacity expenses 
if this were to occur  the company s operating results for that quarter would be negatively impacted 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continually reduce its manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its manufacturing costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses exceeded capital expenditures for new projects and production equipment during by approximately  and the company anticipates that depreciation and amortization expenses will exceed capital expenditures in fiscal year by approximately  the company intends to issue up to  of purchase order commitments for capital equipment from various vendors 
the company anticipates that such equipment will be purchased and become operational during fiscal year the company s planned equipment purchases and other commitments are expected to be funded through cash resources and cash flows expected to be generated from operations  and supplemented by the company s  revolving credit facility  which expires october  selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for administrative  selling and marketing groups  sales commissions to employees and manufacturing representatives  travel  product marketing and promotion costs  as well as legal  accounting  information technology and other administrative costs 
the company expects to continue to make significant and increasing expenditures for selling  general and administrative expenses  especially in connection with implementation of its strategic plan for generating and expanding sales of multi mix products 
research and development expenses consist of materials  salaries and related expenses of certain engineering personnel  and outside services related to product development projects 
the company charges all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development is critical to the company s long term business success 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods  and expect that these costs will increase over time  in order to develop new products  enhance performance of existing products and reduce the cost of current or new products 
critical accounting estimates and policies the company s management makes certain assumptions and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  and sales and expenses 
these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain 
the management judgments that are currently the most critical are related to the accounting for the company s investments in multi mix microtechnology  contract revenue recognition  inventory valuation  valuation of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
below is a further description of these policies as well as the estimates involved 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets the following is a summary of the carrying amounts of the multi mix microtechnology net assets included in the company s consolidated financial statements at december  and the related future planned purchases and lease obligation commitments through january

approximately of the property  plant and equipment may be utilized in other areas of our electronic components and subsystems operations 
the company anticipates receiving additional orders during for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research  for which substantial research and development costs have also been incurred 
due to economic and market conditions in the wireless industry since  wireless telecommunications system service providers substantially reduced their capital equipment purchases from our customers 
while these circumstances have resulted in the delay or cancellation of multi mix microtechnology product purchases that had been anticipated from certain specific cus tomers or programs  in connection with the improved conditions in the industry  the company has implemented a strategic plan utilizing product knowledge and customer focus to expand specific sales opportunities 
continued extended delay or reduction from planned levels in new orders expected from customers for these products could require the company to pursue alternatives related to the utilization or realization of these assets and commitments 
should these alternatives not be realized  the company would have to write down the value of these assets  thereby incurring an impairment charge to earnings  the net result of which would be materially adverse to the financial results and condition of the company 
in accordance with the company s evaluation of multi mix under sfas no 
 the company has determined no provision for impairment is required at this time 
management will continue to monitor the recoverability of the multi mix assets 
contract revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
contract revenue and related costs on fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts that require customization of products to customer specifications are recorded when title transfers to the customer  which is generally on the date of shipment 
prior to shipment  manufacturing costs incurred on such contracts are recorded as work in process inventory 
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations when identified 
revenue related to non recurring engineering charges is generally recognized upon shipment of the related initial units produced or based upon contractually established stages of completion 
the cost rates utilized for cost reimbursement contracts are subject to review by third parties and can be revised  which can result in additions to or reductions from revenue 
revisions which result in reductions to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed and finalized  additions 
table of contents to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed  finalized  accepted by the customer  and collectability from the customer is assured 
the company submits financial information regarding the cost rates on cost reimbursement contracts for each fiscal year in which the company performed work on cost reimbursement contracts 
the company does not record any estimates on a regular basis for potential revenue adjustments  as there currently is no reasonable basis on which to estimate such adjustments given the company s very limited experience with these contracts 
during  the company recognized a revenue reduction of  related to a cost reimbursement contract 
the company recognized revenue of  and  related to cost reimbursement contracts in and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inventories are periodically reviewed for their projected manufacturing usage utilization and  when slow moving or obsolete inventories are identified  a provision for a potential loss is made and charged to operations 
total inventories are net of valuation allowances for obsolescence and cost overruns of  at december  and  at december   of which  and  respectively  represented cost overruns 
procurement of inventory is based on specific customer orders and forecasts 
customers have certain rights of modification with respect to these orders and forecasts 
as a result  customer modifications to orders and forecasts affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory for the related customers 
although we may be able to use some of these excess components and raw materials in other products we manufacture  a portion of the cost of this excess inventory may not be recoverable from customers  nor may any excess quantities be returned to the vendors 
we also may not be able to recover the cost of obsolete inventory from vendors or customers 
write offs or write downs of inventory generally arise from

our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand and that we are not able to return to the vendor or charge back to the customer 
valuation of goodwill with the adoption of sfas no 
by the company on december   goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
however  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the company performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment 
as shown in footnote of the consolidated financial statements  the sales and operating income of the company s microwave micro circuitry segment  conducted through its filtran microcircuits  inc subsidiary  declined during the segment s backlog decreased approximately  since the end of fiscal year and  since the end of fiscal year the principal reason for the reduction in sales was due to declines in the segment s defense orders that had been expected to renew in operating income declined due to the decreased sales  a higher cost structure and reductions in production yields during in response to the decline in fmi s results  the company instituted management changes at filtran during the fourth quarter of the company has begun manufacturing certain filtran products and is currently evaluating plans to move the manufacturing of other filtran products to its costa rica facility to utilize the benefits of the more efficient production equipment and the lower direct labor costs at that facility 
if the performance of fmi does not improve after making the changes listed above  the company may be required to record an impairment charge to its goodwill 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets the company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which should reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s  and net losses weighed heavily in the company s overall assessment 
as a result of the assessment  the company established a full valuation allowance for its remaining net domestic deferred tax assets at december  this assessment continued unchanged from through in and the company recorded additional valuation allowances for certain canadian deferred tax assets of  and  respectively  because it believed that the probability of realization of such assets was uncertain 
management believes that a valuation allowance is not required for the remainder of fmi s recorded deferred tax assets as they are more likely than not to be realized

a variation of in the prime rate and libor during the year ended december  would have affected the company s earnings by approximately  foreign currency risk the company is subject to currency exchange rate risk for the assets  liabilities and cash flows of its subsidiary that operates in canada 
the company does not utilize financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts or other derivatives to limit its exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
there are costs associated with our operations in canada which require payments in the local currency and payments received from customers for goods sold in canada are typically in the local currency 
we partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments by maintaining operating accounts in canada 
a significant portion of the company s sales and receivables including those of its canadian subsidiary are denominated in us dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
alternatively  if the us dollar were to weaken  it would make the company s products more competitive in foreign markets  but could result in higher costs from its canadian operations 
the functional currency for the company s costa rica operations is the united states dollar
