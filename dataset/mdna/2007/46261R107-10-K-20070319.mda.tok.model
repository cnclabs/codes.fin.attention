overview at the end of  we operated retail stores  including in new england and five in florida  and for the year we generated approximately million in sales and had net income of approximately million 
total sales for fiscal a week period increased over fiscal a week period 
total sales for the comparable week period in increased over in  we also achieved a increase in comparable stores sales for the comparable week period 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
this marks our fifth consecutive year of comparable store sales growth 
the year began with a decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter of mostly because easter shifted into the second quarter of from the first quarter in our comparable store sales were also negatively affected by the fact that the new england patriots did not participate in the super bowl in as they had in two previous years 
the decrease in comparable store sales put pressure on our occupancy costs and payroll expense as a percentage to sales resulting in a higher loss in the first quarter of compared to our loss in the first quarter of in the second quarter  comparable stores sales increased largely related the easter shift that affected our first quarter sales 
while our gross profit margin was lower and marketing and sales expense as a percentage to sales were higher  we lowered our general and administrative expense to end the second quarter of with net income of  compared to net income of  in the second quarter of in the third quarter  our comparable stores sales increased by mostly driven by increased traffic to our stores 
after experiencing relatively flat comparable store sales in the first half of the year  we adjusted our advertising spending to drive more traffic into our stores 
we believe that these adjustments helped comparable store sales in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter 
this sales increase led to a higher gross profit margin and lower marketing and sales expense as a percentage to sales 
we also lowered our general and administrative expense in the third quarter of compared to the third quarter of the result of these improvements was a lower net loss in the quarter 
our loss for the third quarter of was million compared to a net loss in the third quarter of of million 
the year ended  with a increase in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter which included a increase in comparable store sales for the halloween season 
in the fourth quarter  our gross profit margin and our marketing and sales expenses as a percentage to sales were slightly lower than the fourth quarter of however  our general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of were higher than the fourth quarter of mostly related to a bonus accrual for the employees in our support office 
for the quarter  our net income was million which was in line with our net income in the fourth quarter of overall  our comparable stores sales increase for was which follows a increase for and a increase in our net income for was million compared to a net loss of million in for  our plan is to continue to increase our comparable store sales growth  increase our gross profit margin percentage and leverage our occupancy costs  marketing and sales expense and general and administrative expense 
at this time  we have no plans to open or acquire any new stores in  unless we come across or are presented with strategic opportunities 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our consolidated revenues for  a week year  were  an increase of  or from  a week year

for the year ended dec  dec  marketing and sales percentage of revenues as a percentage of revenues  the decrease in marketing expense was primarily due to reduction in pre opening expenses associated with the six new stores the opened in general and administrative expense our consolidated general and administrative g a expense for was  or of revenues  a decrease of  and a decrease of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from g a expense consists of payroll and related expenses for executive  merchandising  finance and administrative personnel  as well as information technology  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
for the year ended dec  dec  general and administrative percentage of revenues operating income our operating income for was  or of revenues  compared to an operating income of  or of revenues in interest expense our interest expense in was  an increase of  from the increase during was due to an increase in interest rates  interest expense and warrant expense related to notes payable 
the effective interest rate on our borrowings under our line of credit increased to during compared to in  which increased interest expense by approximately  the interest rate was based on the bank s base rate plus basis points 
interest expense and warrant expense related to notes payable in was  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to a lower average loan balance and a reduction in interest expense related to capital leases associated with our point of sale system 
our average loan balance was approximately  during compared to  in  which decreased interest expense by approximately  additionally  interest expense from capital leases in decreased by  from interest expense in was also slightly offset by interest income of  income taxes in  our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
in  due to our net loss for the year  we did not provide for federal or state income taxes 
additionally  we did not utilize any net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in at the end of  we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net income loss our net income in was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our consolidated revenues for  a week year  were  an increase of  or from  a week year

comparable store sales for were negatively affected by the severe weather that impacted our new england region stores during the first quarter and lower than anticipated comparable store sales during the halloween season in the fourth quarter 
this shortfall was partially offset by positive comparable sales in the third quarter mostly driven by higher sales of boston red sox related merchandise which we believe was due to increased exposure for our brand through our red sox sponsorship program as well as better inventory levels 
cost of goods sold and occupancy costs our cost of products sold and occupancy costs for was  or of revenues  an increase of  and an increase of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from cost of products sold and occupancy costs consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers and the occupancy costs for our stores 
for the year ended dec  dec  cost of goods sold and occupancy costs percentage of revenues as a percentage of revenues  the increase in cost of products sold was primarily attributable to increases in our product costs charged to us by certain key vendors primarily due to rising oil and gasoline prices 
we adjusted our prices to reflect most of theses increases  but given competitive pressure we were not able to pass on all of the increases to our customers 
we also experienced certain delays in implementing our price increases from the time that we were first notified of cost increases from our vendors due to the sheer number of these increases and certain technology limitations in our merchandising system 
by the fourth quarter  our gross profit margin had stabilized and was only slightly lower than the same period in additionally  occupancy costs  as a percentage to revenue  was negatively affected by our new stores  which operate at a higher occupancy to sales ratio until they reach maturity 
marketing and sales expense our consolidated marketing and sales expense for was  or of revenues  an increase of  and an increase of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures  all store payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and other non payroll expenses associated with operating our stores

for the year ended dec  dec  general and administrative percentage of revenues the increase in g a expense was largely attributable to professional fees related to our compliance work for section of sarbanes oxley act and consultant costs associated with the selection of a new merchandise system that we were then considering installing in operating income our operating income for was  or of revenues  compared to an operating income of  or of revenues in other income in we reached a settlement with a third party in connection with the special charge pertaining to our preferred stock previously recorded in fiscal we recorded the net settlement of  as other income during interest expense our interest expense in was  an increase of  from the increase during was due to an increase in interest rates  a higher average loan balance and additional interest expense resulting from capital leases associated with our new point of sale system 
our average loan balance was approximately  during compared to  in  which increased interest expense by approximately  the effective interest rate on our borrowings under our line of credit increased to during compared to in  which increased interest expense by approximately  the interest rate was based on the bank s base rate plus basis points

additionally  we did not utilize any net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in in  our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
at the end of  we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net loss our net loss in was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of  or per basic and per diluted share  in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period  we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before and after our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
at the beginning of we adopted a new policy for estimating the useful life of fixed assets which extended the useful life of equipment and furniture and fixtures 
changing the estimated life of the assets in these categories as of the beginning of reduced depreciation expense by approximately  in net income in would have been per basic and diluted share as opposed to per basic and per diluted share if this change in estimating the useful life of fixed assets had not been adopted 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of the value of a five year non compete agreement from party city corporation party city and its affiliates that covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  and windsor and new london counties in connecticut which expires in this asset has an estimated life of months 
also included is the value related to the retail store lease that we acquired from party city in peabody  massachusetts 
this asset has an estimated life of months  which includes months on the initial term of the store lease plus months on an existing lease renewal option 
the other intangible assets consist of legal and other transaction fees related to the three year note payable due on september  these assets are being amortized over the life of the note payable 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
on november   we closed our store in east providence  rhode island due to underperforming sales 
as a result of this closing  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to remaining lease payments and other closing costs 
the term of the lease is due to expire on august  at december   approximately  remains in the accrual 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our remaining stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in and due to the success of our halloween seasons  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for the last three years and improved merchandise margins in the negative evidence that we considered included we realized a net loss in  our merchandise margins decreased in and  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of fluctuating prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs and those of our suppliers and affect our customers spending levels and patterns  the costs that opening new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  and the expected costs of increased regulatory compliance  including  without limitation  those associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability 
the negative evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that the level of our future profitability is uncertain at this time 
we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance until we have a longer track record of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is a clarification of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
interpretation of fasb interpretation no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
this interpretation also provides guidance of derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin evaluates tax positions by utilizing a two step approach recognition and measurement 
recognition occurs when an enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
once the enterprise has determined that the tax position will be recognized  the measurement step step two needs to be evaluated 
a tax position that meets the criteria in step one is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted fin effective january  and do not feel that there is a material impact of adoption on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no

sfas no

adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided  in compared to using  in  an improvement of  the additional cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower purchases of inventory and an increase to net income compared to a net loss in we used  in investing activities in compared to  in the cash invested in was primarily due to the acquisition in august of one retail store and a five year non compete agreement with party city 
additional cash invested in was used for fixed assets associated with improvements of exiting stores 
the cash invested in was primarily for fixed assets associated with new stores  an existing store expansion and point of sale system enhancements 
we used  in financing activities in compared to providing  by financing activities in  a decrease of  we decreased our borrowings under our line of credit by  in to million compared to an increase of  in to million 
the borrowings under our line of credit in were lower than primarily due to paying the line of credit down with funds received from a million note payable that we entered into during the third quarter of with highbridge international llc  an institutional accredited investor 
other factors contributing to higher borrowings in were capital expenditures related to the six new store openings  enhancements to our point of sale system  and to support our net loss 
in  pursuant to our supply agreement with amscan  we elected to convert  of extended payables originally due to amscan as of august  as well as an additional  of payables due to amscan as of september  into a single subordinated promissory note in the total principal amount of  during  we did not acquire any assets under capital leases 
during  we acquired assets under capital leases totaling  for new copiers for our support office 
the capital lease obligations outstanding at december  were  at december   we had a line of credit the line with wells fargo retail finance ii  llc  which had been amended on december  the amendment continues our line of credit with wells fargo at  including a  term loan and extends it for three additional years to january  in addition  our new agreement with wells fargo includes an option whereby we may increase our line of credit up to a maximum level of  upon days written notice  as long as we were in compliance with all debt covenants and the other provisions of the loan agreement 
the new agreement also adjusts the interest rate applicable to our borrowings and permits us at our option  to use the london interbank offered rate libor for certain of our borrowings 
our inventory and accounts receivable secure our line of credit 
we borrow against these assets at agreed upon advance rates  which may vary at different times of the year 
the amended agreement includes a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum availability under the line of of the credit limit 
the amended agreement also has a covenant that requires us to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
on august   we amended our agreement with wells fargo to permit us to enter into a supply agreement with amscan and an asset purchase agreement with party city 
the amendment also allowed us to incur the indebtedness represented by the amscan note  defined below  and the party city note  defined below  and to incur other unsecured subordinated indebtedness consented to by wells fargo 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory and other adjustments  including vendor rebates  discounts and freight costs 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which takes our inventory at cost and reflects adjustments that our lender has approved which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consists primarily of vendor rebates receivables and credit card receivables 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous two to three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december  our total borrowing base is determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit  which was million at december  under the terms of our line of credit  our  credit limit was further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
therefore  our additional availability was  at december  and  at december  the amounts outstanding under our line were  at december  and  as of december  the outstanding balances under our line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
on january   we amended our agreement to allow for a  term loan which increased our borrowing base  but did not increase the million credit limit 
we borrowed the full  on that date 
the interest rate on the term loan is the bank s base rate plus basis points 
during the time the term loan remains outstanding  the interest rate on the line of credit will be the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the amendment also waived a default as a consequence of the fact that the principal balance of the line of credit exceeded our availability on january  on october   we further amended our agreement to extend the maturity date of our outstanding term loan in the amount of  from october  to january  on december   we further amended our agreement to extend the maturity date of our outstanding term loan in the amount of  to october  the term loan is currently outstanding and is due and payable in full on october  our supply agreement with amscan gives us the right to receive certain additional rebates and more favorable pricing terms over the term of the agreement than generally were available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
the right to receive additional rebates  and the amount of such rebates  are subject to our achievement of increased levels of purchases and other factors provided for in the supply agreement 
in exchange  the supply agreement obligates us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan until the supply agreement provides for a ramp up period during and and  for five years beginning with calendar year  requires us to purchase on an annual basis merchandise equal to the total number of our stores open during such calendar year  multiplied by  the supply agreement provides for penalties in the event we fail to attain the annual purchase commitment that would require us to pay to amscan the difference between the purchases for that year and the annual purchase commitment for that year 
the supply agreement also provided for amscan to extend  until october   approximately  of certain currently due amscan payables owed by us to amscan which would otherwise have been payable by us on august  the extended payables and gave us the right  at our option  to convert the extended payables into a subordinated promissory note 
on october   we elected to convert  of extended payables originally due to amscan as of august  as well as an additional  of payables due to amscan as of september  into a single subordinated promissory note in the total principal amount of  the amscan note 
the amscan note bears interest at the rate of per annum and is payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  commencing on november   and on the first day of each month thereafter until october   when the entire remaining principal balance and all accrued interest is due and payable 
on august   we also entered into and simultaneously closed an asset purchase agreement with party city  an affiliate of amscan  pursuant to which we acquired a party city retail party goods store in peabody  massachusetts and received a five year non competition covenant from party city  for aggregate consideration of  payable by a subordinated note in the principal amount of  which will bear interest at the rate of per annum the party city note and  in cash 
the party city note is payable by quarterly interest only payments over four years  with the full principal amount due at the note s maturity on august  on september   we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we raised million through a combination of subordinated debt and warrants issued to highbridge international llc highbridge  an institutional accredited investor 
under the terms of the financing  we issued highbridge a three year million subordinated note the highbridge note that bears interest at an interest rate of prime plus one percent 
the highbridge note matures on september  in addition  we issued highbridge a warrant the highbridge warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  or of the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately prior to the closing of the transaction 
we allocated approximately  of value to the highbridge warrant using the black scholes model with volatility of  interest of and expected life of five years 
the highbridge warrant is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the highbridge note 
the agreements entered into in connection with the financing provide for certain restrictions and covenants consistent with highbridge s status as a subordinated lender  and also grant highbridge resale registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the highbridge warrant 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant triggered certain anti dilution provisions of our series b  c  and d convertible preferred stock 
as a result  the outstanding shares of these three series of preferred stock are now convertible into an aggregate of  additional shares of common stock 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant  however  did not trigger the anti dilution provisions of our series e or f convertible preferred stock or any of our other outstanding warrants 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet contractual commitments 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be primarily related to existing store improvements 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under the existing line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations and working capital requirements through the next twelve months 
in the event that our operating plan changes or proves inaccurate due to lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
if so  we would be required to adjust our expenditures in to conserve working capital or raise additional capital to fund operations 
there can be no assurance  that  should we seek or require additional financing  such financing will be available  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
at this time  we have no plans to open or acquire any new stores in  unless we come across or are presented with strategic opportunities 
contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within year within years within years after years total line of credit capital lease obligations notes payable supply agreement operating leases including retail space leases total contractual obligations in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately  for the acquisition of inventory and non inventory items that were scheduled for delivery after december  acquisitions we operate in a largely un branded market that has many small businesses 
as a result  we may consider growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
any determination to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any acquisition would enhance our prospects 
we presently have no plans  agreements  understandings  or arrangements with respect to any acquisitions 
stockholder rights plan on november   we announced that our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the rights plan 
under the rights plan each share of our capital stock outstanding at the close of business on november  and each share of our capital stock issued subsequent to that date has a right associated with it  such that each share of our common stock is entitled to one right and each share of our preferred stock is entitled to such number of rights equal to the number of common shares into which it is convertible 
the rights will become exercisable only in the event that  with certain exceptions  an acquiring party accumulates percent or more of our voting stock or if a party announces an offer to acquire percent or more of our voting stock 
the rights expire on november  when exercisable  each right entitles the holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of a new series of series g junior preferred stock at an initial purchase price of  subject to adjustment 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  holders of the rights will be entitled to purchase either iparty corp 
stock or shares in an acquiring entity at half of market value 
we generally will be entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time until the date on which a percent position in our voting stock is acquired by any person or group 
until a right is exercised  the holder of a right will have no rights as a stockholder of iparty solely by virtue of being a rights holder  including  without limitation  the right to vote or receive dividends 
on september   we amended the rights plan to clarify that the issuance of the highbridge warrant did not constitute a triggering event under the rights plan 
seasonality due to the seasonality of our business  sales and operating income are typically higher in our second and fourth quarters 
our business is highly dependent upon sales of easter  graduation and summer merchandise in the second quarter and sales of halloween and christmas merchandise in the fourth quarter 
we have typically operated at a loss during the first and third quarters 
geographic concentration as of december  we operated a total of stores  of which are located in new england 
as a result  a severe or prolonged regional recession or regional changes in demographics  employment levels  population  weather patterns  real estate market conditions or other factors specific to the new england region may adversely affect us more than a company that is more geographically diverse 
effects of inflation while we do not view the effects of inflation as having a direct material effect upon our business  we believe that volatility in oil and gasoline prices impact the cost of producing petroleum based plastic products  which are a key raw material in much of our merchandise  and also impact prices of shipping products made overseas in foreign countries  such as china  which includes much of our merchandise 
volatile oil and gasoline prices also impact our freight costs  consumer confidence and spending patterns 
these and other issues directly or indirectly affecting our vendors and us could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors

in general  however  we do not believe we have the various market or price risks that require the quantitative and qualitative disclosures set forth in item of regulation s k 
we have interest rate risk on our line of credit debt obligation to the extent that if interest rates were to rise our rate of interest under our line of credit would also increase 
we do not believe that this interest rate risk is material and we have not entered into any hedging or similar contractual arrangements with respect to such risk or with respect to the indirect market risks we face from changes in foreign exchange rates and oil prices 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes
