item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and highlights we are a commercial lending  investment and asset management company focused on the middle market 
we operate as a reit and provide senior and subordinate commercial loans  invest in real estate  engage in asset management and servicing activities and invest in residential mortgage assets 
we expect to formally make an election to reit status for when we file our tax return for the year ended december  through our commercial lending and investment activities  our primary goal is to be the provider of financing of choice for middle market businesses that require customized and sophisticated financing 
we operate through three principal commercial finance businesses healthcare and specialty finance  which generally provides first mortgage loans  asset based revolving lines of credit  real estate lease financing and cash flow loans to healthcare businesses and a broad range of other companies  structured finance  which generally engages in commercial and residential real estate finance and also provides asset based lending to finance companies  and corporate finance  which generally provides senior and subordinate loans through direct origination and participation in widely syndicated loan transactions 
in  we grew our asset management business 
we completed our first clo issuance comprising a portfolio of originated and acquired cash flow loans 
we also opened warehouse facilities for two additional clos that we intend to close over the next months 
in addition to our clo business  we are party to a joint venture to acquire distressed and other types of debt investments 
as with our clos  we are the asset manager for this joint venture and receive a fee for managing the assets owned by the joint venture 
we view these and other potential asset management businesses as complementary opportunities for us to leverage our commercial finance expertise into managing financial assets owned by third parties 
we intend to further build out our asset management businesses by focusing on additional product types  which  for example  may include managing subordinated debt and equity investments for others 
to optimize our reit structure  we also invest in certain residential mortgage assets 
as of december   the balance of our residential mortgage investment portfolio was billion  which included investments in residential mortgage loans and rmbs 
consolidated results of operations on january   we began operating as two reportable segments commercial lending investment and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial lending investment segment includes our commercial lending and investment business and our residential mortgage investment segment includes all of our activities related to our residential mortgage investments 
the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
explanation of reporting metrics interest income 
in our commercial lending investment segment  interest income represents interest earned on our commercial loans 
the majority of these loans charge interest at variable rates that generally adjust daily  with an increasing number of loans charging interest at fixed rates 
as of december  and  approximately of our outstanding loan balance had a fixed rate of interest 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  interest income represents interest earned on our residential mortgage related receivables and rmbs 
fee income 
in our commercial lending investment segment  fee income represents net fee income earned from our commercial loan operations 
fee income primarily includes the amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination  the amortization of fees related to syndicated loans that we originate and other fees charged to borrowers 
we amortize these loan fees into income over the contractual life of our loans and do not take loan fees into income when a loan closes 
loan prepayments may materially affect fee income since  in the period of prepayment  the amortization of remaining net loan origination fees and discounts is accelerated and prepayment penalties may be assessed on the prepaid loans and recognized in the period of the prepayment 
we consider both the acceleration of any unamortized fees and fees related to prepayment penalties to be prepayment related fee income 
we currently do not generate fee income in our residential mortgage investment segment 
operating lease income 
in our commercial lending investment segment  operating lease income represents lease income earned in connection with our direct real estate investments 
our operating leases typically include fixed rental payments  subject to escalation over the life of the lease 
we project a minimum escalation rate for the leases and recognize operating lease income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we currently do not generate any operating lease income in our residential mortgage investment segment 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees 
in our commercial lending investment segment  our borrowings consist of repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  our borrowings consist of repurchase agreements and term debt 
the majority of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based primarily on one month libor or commercial paper rates plus a margin 
currently  our convertible debt  three series of our subordinated debt and our term debt issued in connection with our investments in mortgage related receivables bear a fixed rate of interest 
as our borrowings increase and as short term interest rates rise  our interest expense will increase 
deferred financing fees and the costs of issuing debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the estimated life of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
we record a provision for loan losses in both our commercial lending investment segment and our residential mortgage investment segment 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our commercial lending portfolio and in our portfolio of residential mortgage related receivables 
as the size and mix of loans within these portfolios change  or if the credit quality of the portfolios change  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
other income 
in our commercial lending investment segment  other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on derivatives  due diligence deposits forfeited  fees associated with the united states department of housing and urban development  or hud  origination activities  unrealized appreciation depreciation of our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities  third party servicing income and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our commercial lending and investment operations 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  other income expense consists of unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain of our residential mortgage investments and gains losses on derivatives used to economically hedge the residential mortgage investment portfolio 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for both our commercial lending investment segment and our residential mortgage investment segment include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
we expect to formally make an election to reit status for under the code when we file our tax return for our taxable year ended december  provided we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that we derive from our reit qualifying activities  but we will continue to be subject to corporate level tax on the earnings we derive from our trss 
we do not expect our residential mortgage investment segment to be subject to corporate level tax as all assets are considered reit qualifying assets 
a significant portion of our commercial lending investment segment will remain subject to corporate level income tax as many of the segment s assets are originated and held in our trss 
we were responsible for paying federal  state and local income taxes on all of our income for the years ended december  and adjusted earnings 
adjusted earnings represents net income as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  adjusted for certain non cash items  including real estate depreciation  amortization of deferred financing fees  non cash equity compensation  unrealized gains and losses on our residential mortgage investment portfolio and related derivatives  unrealized gains and losses on other derivatives and foreign currencies  net unrealized gains and losses on investments  provision for loan losses  charge offs  recoveries  nonrecurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
we view adjusted earnings and the related per share measures as useful and appropriate supplements to net income and earnings per share 
these measures serve as an additional measure of our operating performance because they facilitate evaluation of the company without the effects of certain adjustments determined in accordance with gaap that may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance 
adjusted earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows each computed in accordance with gaap 
instead  adjusted earnings should be reviewed in connection with income and cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities in our consolidated financial statements  to help analyze how our business is performing 
adjusted earnings and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the reit industry 
investors should consider these differences when comparing our adjusted earnings to other reits 
operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations in continued to be driven primarily by our continued growth as well as the impact of our reit election 
as further described below  the most significant factors influencing our consolidated results of operations for the time period were a decrease in our effective tax rate  significant growth in our commercial loan portfolio  addition of operating lease income related to our direct real estate investments  increased borrowings to fund our growth  increased operating expenses  including higher employee compensation related to increases in the number of our employees  an increase in short term interest rates  and decreased lending and borrowing spreads 
our consolidated operating results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows year ended year ended december  december  change change change change in thousands in thousands interest income fee income operating lease income   n a n a interest expense provision for loan losses operating expenses other income noncontrolling interests expense   n a n a income taxes cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes n a n a net income our consolidated yields on income earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  weighted net average weighted net average average investment yield average investment yield balance income cost balance income cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total direct real estate investments total income earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  mortgage related receivables  rmbs  loans  and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
comparison of the years ended december  and all amounts below relating to our commercial lending investment segment for the year ended december  are compared to our consolidated results for the year ended december  as we did not report our operations in segments in  and all activity for the year ended december  was related to commercial lending and investment activity 
all references to commercial loans below include loans  loans held for sale and receivables under reverse repurchase agreements 
interest income in our commercial lending investment segment  interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from total interest income for the year ended december  this increase was due to the growth in average interest earning assets  primarily loans  of billion  or  as well as an increase in the interest component of yield to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the interest component of yield was largely due to the increase in short term interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in our lending spread 
during the year ended december   our commercial lending spread to average one month libor was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in lending spread reflects overall trends in financial markets  the increase in competition in our markets  as well as the changing mix of our commercial lending portfolio as we pursue the expanded opportunities afforded to us by our decision to elect to be taxed as a reit 
by operating as a reit  we can make the same  or better  after tax return on a loan with a lower interest rate than on a loan with a higher interest rate originated prior to our decision to elect to be taxed as a reit 
fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors  including changes in short term interest rates such as changes in the prime rate or one month libor  the coupon on new loan originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and modifications of interest rates on existing loans 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  interest income was million for the year ended december  included in this amount is the amortization of purchase discounts on our investments in rmbs and mortgage related receivables  which are amortized into income using the interest method 
average interest earning assets  which consist primarily of residential mortgage related receivables and rmbs  were billion as of december  yield on average interest earning assets was for the year ended december  fee income in our commercial lending investment segment  the increase in fee income was primarily the result of the growth in interest earning assets as well as an increase in prepayment related fee income  which totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  prepayment related fee income contributed and  to yield for the years ended december  and  respectively 
yield from fee income decreased to for the year ended december  from for year ended december  operating lease income in our commercial lending investment segment  million of operating lease income was earned in connection with our direct real estate investments acquired during the year ended december  interest expense we fund our growth largely through borrowings 
in our commercial lending investment segment  interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from total interest expense for the year ended december  this increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of billion  or  as well as rising interest rates during the year 
our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was the result of rising interest rates  the use of our unsecured credit facility  which has a higher borrowing spread relative to our secured credit facilities  and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees 
the increase in deferred financing fees was primarily due to additional financings and higher loan prepayments on loans that secure our term debt 
these increases were partially offset by lower borrowing margins and our use of more cost effective sources of financing 
our overall borrowing spread to average one month libor for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  in our residential mortgage investment segment  interest expense was million for the year ended december   resulting from average borrowings of billion 
our cost of borrowings for this segment was for the year ended december  net finance margin in our commercial lending investment segment  net finance margin  defined as net investment income which includes interest  fee and operating lease income less interest expense divided by average income earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net finance margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from a higher cost of funds  offset partially by an increase in yield on total income earning assets resulting from higher loan prepayments 
net finance spread  which represents the difference between our gross yield on income earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest  fee and operating lease income divided by our average income earning assets 
the decrease in net finance spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of income earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities in our commercial lending investment segment for the year ended december  and were as follows year ended december  weighted net average weighted net average average investment yield average investment yield balance income cost balance income cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total direct real estate investments total income earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  loans and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  net finance spread was for the year ended december  net finance spread is the difference between yield on interest earning assets of and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities of for the year ended december  interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  mortgage related receivables and rmbs 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements and term debt 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision for loan losses in our commercial lending investment segment is the result of growth in our commercial loan portfolio  an increase in the balance of impaired loans in the portfolio and additional allocated reserves recorded during the year ended december  other income in our commercial lending investment segment  other income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from total other income for the year ended december  the increase in other income was primarily attributable to the receipt of a break up fee of million related to a prospective loan  a million increase in net realized and unrealized gains in our equity investments  a million increase on net gains on derivatives  a million increase in income relating to our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities and a million increase in diligence deposits forfeited 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in third party servicing fees and a million loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt in connection with one of our direct real estate investments entered into during the year ended december  in our residential mortgage investment segment  other income consisted of a gain on the residential mortgage investment portfolio of million for the year ended december  this gain was attributable to net realized and unrealized gains on related derivative instruments of million  partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on residential mortgage investments of million 
included in unrealized gains on derivative instruments is not only the change in fair value of these instruments  but also the net of interest income and expense accruals related to certain of our derivatives 
operating expenses the increase in consolidated operating expenses was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to an increase in our average number of employees to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   as well as higher incentive compensation  including an increase in the value of restricted stock awards and stock options granted 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as stock options and restricted stock awards  which generally have a three to five year vesting period 
the remaining increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in professional fees  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization primarily resulting from our direct real estate investments  an increase of million in travel and entertainment expenses and an increase of million in other general business expenses 
operating expenses in our residential mortgage investment segment  which consist primarily of compensation and benefits  professional fees and other direct expenses  were million for the year ended december  in our commercial lending investment segment  operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our commercial lending investment segment s efficiency ratio  which represents operating expenses as a percentage of net investment income and other income  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses described above 
income taxes our effective tax rate on our consolidated net income was for the year ended december   which is impacted by a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities as a result of our reit election 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  attributable to our trss was 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  adjusted earnings adjusted earnings  as previously defined  were million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  a reconciliation of our reported net income to adjusted earnings for the year ended december  was as follows in thousands  except per share data net income add real estate depreciation amortization of deferred financing fees non cash equity compensation net unrealized loss on residential mortgage investment portfolio  including related derivatives unrealized gain on derivatives and foreign currencies  net unrealized loss on investments  net provision for loan losses recoveries less charge offs nonrecurring items cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes adjusted earnings net income per share basic as reported diluted as reported average shares outstanding basic as reported diluted as reported adjusted earnings per share basic diluted average shares outstanding basic diluted depreciation for direct real estate investments only 
excludes depreciation for corporate leasehold improvements  fixed assets and other non real estate items 
includes adjustments to reflect the period change in fair value of rmbs and related derivative instruments 
includes all recoveries on loans during the period 
to the extent we experience losses on loans for which we specifically provided a reserve prior to january   there will be no adjustment to earnings 
all charge offs incremental to previously established allocated reserves will be deducted from net income 
represents the write off of a net deferred tax liability recorded in connection with our conversion to a reit for the year ended december  adjusted to reflect the impact of adding back noncontrolling interests expense of million to adjusted earnings due to the application of the if converted method on non managing member units  which are considered dilutive to adjusted earnings per share  but are antidilutive to gaap net income per share for all periods presented 
adjusted to include average non managing member units of  which are considered dilutive to adjusted earnings per share  but are antidilutive to gaap net income per share 
comparison of the years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets of billion  or  as well as an increase in the interest component of yield to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest earning assets increased during primarily from the growth in loans in our commercial lending portfolio 
the increase in the interest component of yield was largely due to the increase in short term interest rates  offset by a decrease in our lending spread 
during  our overall lending spread to the average prime rate was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in lending spread reflects both the increase in competition in our markets  as well as the changing mix of our commercial lending portfolio toward a greater percentage of asset based and real estate loans 
fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors including the coupon on new loan originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and the effect of external interest rates 
fee income the increase in fee income was primarily the result of the growth in interest earning assets as well as an increase in prepayment fees  which aggregated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  yield from fee income decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to lower prepayment and other fees relative to the growth of average interest earning assets 
interest expense we fund our growth largely through borrowings 
consequently  the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of billion  or  as well as rising interest rates during the period 
our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was the result of rising interest rates and an increase in amortization of deferred financing fees due to additional financings and higher loan prepayments in our term debt  partially offset by lower borrowing margins and our use of more cost effective sources of financing 
our overall borrowing spread to average one month libor for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  net finance margin net finance margin  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decline of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net finance margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from a higher cost of funds and higher leverage  offset partially by an increase in yield 
net finance spread  the difference between our gross yield on interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average interest earning assets 
the decrease in net finance spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of interest earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  interest and interest and weighted fee income average weighted fee income average average interest yield average interest yield balance expense cost balance expense cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin net yield on interest earning assets interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  mortgage backed securities accounted for on a gross basis  loans and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements accounted for on a gross basis  secured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision for loan losses is the result of the growth in our loan portfolio  the increase in the balance of impaired loans in the portfolio and a change in our loan loss reserve estimates 
during the year ended december   we changed our loan loss reserve policy  which included increasing our loan loss reserve estimates based on revised reserve factors by loan type that consider historical loss experience  the seasoning of our portfolio  overall economic conditions and other factors 
other income the increase in other income was primarily due to an increase in gain on investments  net of million and the recognition of gains on the sale of loans of million occurring during  partially offset by a decrease in fees arising from our hud mortgage origination services of million and an increase in loss on derivatives of million 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to an increase in employees to as of december  from as of december   as well as higher incentive compensation  including an increase in restricted stock awards granted during a significant portion of employee compensation is composed of annual bonuses and restricted stock awards  which generally have a three to five year vesting period 
during  we established a variable methodology for employee bonuses partially based on the performance of the company  pursuant to which we accrued for employee bonuses throughout the year 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  we reversed million of accrued incentive compensation that was recorded in the first three quarters of this reversal was made to align overall incentive compensation  for our chief executive officer and our vice chairman and former chief investment officer with financial performance targets 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was attributable to an increase of million in professional fees incurred in connection with our reit election plan  an increase of million in rent  an increase of million in travel and entertainment  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in other general business expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio  which represents operating expenses as a percentage of our net interest and fee income and other income  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvements in operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets and the efficiency ratio were attributable to controlling our operating expenses and spreading those expenses over a growing portfolio of loans 
the improvement in our efficiency ratio also partially resulted from the significant increase in our net interest and fee income 
income taxes we provided for income taxes on the income earned for the year ended december  based on a effective tax rate compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended december  financial condition commercial lending investment segment portfolio composition we provide commercial loans to businesses that require customized and sophisticated financing 
we also invest in real estate and selectively make equity investments 
as of december  and  our commercial lending and investment portfolio comprised the following december  in thousands commercial loans direct real estate investments equity investments total commercial lending portfolio composition our total commercial loan portfolio reflected in the portfolio statistics below includes loans  loans held for sale and receivables under reverse repurchase agreements

we may have more than one loan to a client and its related entities 
for purposes of determining the portfolio statistics in this section  we count each loan or client separately and do not aggregate loans to related entities 
the number of loans  average loan size  number of clients and average loan size per client by commercial finance business as of december  was as follows average loan number average number of size per of loans loan size clients client in thousands composition of loan portfolio by business healthcare and specialty finance structured finance corporate finance overall loan portfolio the scheduled maturities of our commercial loan portfolio by loan type as of december  were as follows due in due in one year one to due after or less five years five years total in thousands scheduled maturities by loan type senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans senior secured cash flow loans subordinate loans total includes term b loans

throughout  the mix of outstanding loans in our commercial loan portfolio has shifted to a greater percentage of first mortgage and asset based loans  including complementary fixed rate and low leverage real estate products  which have become more attractive as a result of our status as a reit 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses as of december  and  the principal balances of loans or more days contractually delinquent  non accrual loans and impaired loans in our commercial lending portfolio were as follows december  commercial loan asset classification in thousands loans or more days contractually delinquent non accrual loans impaired loans less loans in multiple categories total total as a percentage of total loans total as a percentage of all commercial assets includes commercial loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans or more days contractually delinquent 
includes commercial loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans or more days contractually delinquent  and commercial loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans on non accrual status 
reflective of principles established in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
in this regard  impaired loans includes those loans where we expect to encounter a significant delay in the collection of  and or shortfall in the amount of  contractual payments due to us 
during the year ended december   we classified commercial loans with an aggregate carrying value of million as of december  as troubled debt restructurings as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
as of december   commercial loans with an aggregate carrying value of million were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
additionally  under sfas no 
 loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are also assessed as impaired  generally for a period of at least one year following the restructuring 
the allocated reserve for commercial loans classified as troubled debt restructurings was million as of december  for the year ended december   commercial loans with an aggregate carrying value of million as of december  were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
the allocated reserve for commercial loans classified as troubled debt restructurings was million as of december  middle market lending involves credit risks that we believe will result in further credit losses in our portfolio 
we have provided an allowance for loan losses to cover estimated losses inherent in our commercial loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts equate to and of gross loans as of december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to additional charge offs recognized during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of our total allowance for loan losses as of december  and  million and million  respectively  were allocated to impaired loans 
during the years ended december  and  we charged off loans totaling million and million  respectively 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
direct real estate investments during  we began acquiring real estate for long term investment purposes 
these direct real estate investments are generally leased to clients through the execution of long term  triple net operating leases 
under a typical triple net lease  the client agrees to pay a base monthly operating lease payment and all facility operating expenses as well as make capital improvements 
as of december   we had million in direct real estate investments which consisted primarily of land and buildings 
equity investments we commonly acquire equity interests in connection with loans to clients 
these investments include common stock  preferred stock  limited liability company interests  limited partnership interests and warrants to purchase equity instruments 
in the past  we have also invested in debt securities  the majority of which were sold during the year ended december  as of december  and  the carrying values of our investments in our commercial lending investment segment were million and million  respectively 
included in these balances were investments carried at fair value totaling million and million  respectively 
residential mortgage investment segment portfolio composition we invest directly in residential mortgage investments and as of december  and  our portfolio of residential mortgage investments was as follows december  in thousands mortgage related receivables residential mortgage backed securities agency non agency total represents secured receivables that are backed by adjustable rate residential prime mortgage loans 
see following paragraph for a description of these securities 
we invest in rmbs  which are securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans 
these agency mbs include mortgage backed securities whose payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
we also have invested in non agency mbs  which are rmbs that are not issued by fannie mae or freddie mac and that are credit enhanced through various mechanisms inherent in the corresponding securitization structures 
substantially all of our rmbs are collateralized by adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  including hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans 
we account for our agency mbs as debt securities that are classified as trading investments and included in mortgage backed securities pledged  trading on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
we account for our non agency mbs as debt securities that are classified as available for sale and included in investments on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
the coupons on the loans underlying rmbs are fixed for stipulated periods of time and then reset annually thereafter 
the weighted average net coupon of agency mbs in our portfolio was as of december  and the weighted average reset date for the portfolio was approximately months 
the weighted average net coupon of non agency mbs in our portfolio was as of december  the fair values of our agency mbs and non agency mbs were billion and million  respectively  as of december  as of december   we owned billion of agency mbs that were simultaneously financed with repurchase agreements with the same counterparty from whom the investments were purchased 
because of this purchase and financing relationship  these transactions were recorded net on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  such that a forward commitment to purchase agency mbs was recognized for financial statement purposes as well as a margin related cash deposit that was made in connection with the related repurchase agreements 
these commitments  which were accounted for as derivatives  were considered forward commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities and were recorded at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value included in income for the year ended december  the fair value  including accrued interest  of these forward commitments to purchase agency mbs was million as of december  in march  we exercised our right to substitute collateral assigned to repurchase agreements that were executed to finance the purchase of agency mbs 
in so doing  we concluded that we obtained effective control over the agency mbs and  therefore  recognized acquired agency mbs and the principal balance of amounts used pursuant to the corresponding repurchase agreements on our balance sheet at fair value at the date the substitution was completed 
as of december   we had billion in mortgage related receivables secured by prime residential mortgage loans 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on these receivables was  and the weighted average contractual maturity was approximately years 
see further discussion on our accounting treatment of mortgage related receivables in note  mortgage related receivables and related owners trust securitizations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit quality and allowance for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of million related to our mortgage related receivables during the year ended december  and the allowance for loan losses was million as of december  to date  we have experienced no charge offs on these investments 
financing we have financed our investments in rmbs primarily through repurchase agreements 
as of december  and  our outstanding repurchase agreements totaled billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   repurchase agreements that we executed had maturities of between and days and a weighted average borrowing rate of 
our investments in residential mortgage related receivables were financed primarily through debt issued in connection with two securitization transactions 
as of december   the total outstanding balance of these debt obligations was billion 
the interest rates on all classes of the notes within each securitization are fixed for various periods of time and then reset annually thereafter  with a weighted average interest rate of as of december  the notes within each securitization are expected to mature at various dates through the interest rates on our repurchase agreements  securitization based debt and other financings may change at different times and in different magnitudes than the interest rates earned on our residential mortgage investments 
see market risk management below for a discussion of our interest rate risk management program related to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  which include funding our existing commercial loan and investment commitments  acquiring residential mortgage investments  funding ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  paying dividends and for other general business purposes 
our primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our existing and future repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  subordinated debt and convertible debt  proceeds from issuances of equity and other sources 
we believe these sources of financing are sufficient to meet our short term liquidity needs 
we have applied for an industrial loan corporation charter with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
if the charter is granted  we expect to obtain additional funds through the brokered deposit market 
as of december   the amount of our unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients exceeded our unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by billion 
we expect that our commercial loan commitments will continue to exceed our available funds indefinitely 
our obligation to fund unfunded commitments generally is based on our clients ability to provide additional collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the additional collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements and our clients ability to meet certain other preconditions to borrowing 
provided our clients additional collateral meets all of the eligibility requirements of our funding sources  we believe that we have sufficient funding capacity to meet short term needs related to unfunded commitments 
if we do not have sufficient funding capacity to satisfy these commitments  our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as a result of our decision to make an election to reit status  we may continue to acquire additional residential mortgage investments 
as discussed below  we have funded and expect to continue to fund these purchases primarily through repurchase agreements and term debt using leverage consistent with industry standards for these assets 
we will determine our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements based on the growth rate of our portfolio and other assets 
additionally  as a reit  our growth must be funded largely by external sources of capital due to the requirement to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders to qualify as a reit 
we are not required to distribute the taxable income related to our trss and  therefore  have the flexibility to retain these earnings 
we intend to pay dividends at least equal to of our reit taxable income 
we may cause our trss to pay dividends to us to increase our reit taxable income  subject to the reit gross income limitations 
if we are limited in the amount of dividends we can receive from our trss  we intend to use other sources of cash to fund dividend payments 
in  our trss paid a million dividend to us 
we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital from time to time to support our growth 
in addition to raising equity  we plan to continue to access the debt market for capital and to continue to explore additional sources of financing 
we expect these financings will include additional secured and unsecured credit facilities  secured and unsecured term debt  subordinated debt  repurchase agreements  equity related securities such as convertible debt and or other financing sources 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will have access to any of these funding sources in the future 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
we invest cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash primarily represents both principal and interest collections on loans collateralizing our term debt and on loans pledged to our credit facilities 
we also have restricted cash representing other items such as client holdbacks  escrows and securities pledged as collateral to secure our repurchase agreements and related derivatives 
principal repayments  interest rate swap payments  interest payable and servicing fees are deducted from the monthly principal and interest collections funded by loans collateralizing our credit facilities and term debt  and the remaining restricted cash is returned to us and becomes unrestricted at that time 
sources and uses of cash for the years ended december  and  we used cash from operations of million and million  respectively 
included within these amounts are cash outflows related to the purchase of agency mbs that are classified as trading investments and loans held for sale 
for the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million 
cash from our financing activities is generated from proceeds from our issuance of equity  borrowings on our repurchase agreements  credit facilities and term debt and from our issuance of convertible debt and subordinated debt 
our financing activities primarily use cash to repay term debt borrowings and to pay cash dividends 
for the years ended december   and  we generated cash flow from financing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to loan origination  purchases of residential mortgage investments  primarily mortgage related receivables  and acquisitions of direct real estate investments 
for the years ended december   and  we used cash in investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings totaling billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt have supported our growth 
for a detailed discussion of our borrowings  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  our funding sources  maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding  and unused available commitments  subject to certain minimum equity requirements and other covenants and conditions as of december  were as follows maximum facility amount unused funding source amount outstanding capacity in thousands repurchase agreements unsecured credit facilities secured credit facilities subtotal term debt convertible debt subordinated debt total our term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt are one time fundings that do not provide any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
excludes issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december  our overall debt strategy emphasizes diverse sources of financing including both secured and unsecured financings 
as of december   approximately of our debt was collateralized by our loans and residential mortgage investments and was unsecured 
we intend to increase our percentage of unsecured debt over time through both unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term debt 
fitch ratings issued an investment grade rating to our senior unsecured debt during as we continue to grow  we expect to obtain investment grade ratings from other rating agencies and to improve these ratings over time 
as our ratings improve  we should be able to issue more unsecured debt relative to the amount of our secured debt 
in any case  we intend to maintain prudent levels of leverage and currently expect our debt to equity ratio on our commercial lending portfolio to remain below x 
repurchase agreements we entered into seven new master repurchase agreements during the year ended december  we also borrowed under our new and existing repurchase agreements with various financial institutions to finance purchases of rmbs during the year 
rmbs and short term liquid investments collateralize our repurchase agreements as of december  substantially all of our repurchase agreements and related derivative instruments require us to deposit additional collateral if interest rates change or the market value of existing collateral declines  which may require us to sell assets to reduce our borrowings 
credit facilities during the year ended december   we increased our committed credit facility capacity by million to billion 
this net increase in capacity primarily resulted from the addition of a million unsecured credit facility  the addition of a million secured credit facility in our qrs and a million capacity increase in our previously existing qrs secured credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by decreased capacity  totaling billion  in one of our trs s subsidiary s credit facilities 
as of december   we had seven credit facilities  six of which are secured and one of which is unsecured  with a total of financial institutions that we primarily use to fund our loans and for general corporate purposes 
to date  many loans have been held  or warehoused  in our secured credit facilities until we complete a term debt transaction in which we securitize a pool of loans from these facilities 
we primarily use the proceeds from our term debt transactions to pay down our credit facilities  which results in increased capacity to redraw on them as needed 
as of december   one of our credit facilities  with a total capacity of million  is scheduled to mature within one year 
the amount outstanding under this facility was million as of december  our other six credit facilities  with a total capacity of billion  have scheduled maturity dates between one and three years  of which billion is subject to annual renewal 
in addition  in december  we entered into a million loan agreement with column financial inc to finance the acquisition of of the healthcare properties we hold as direct real estate investments 
under the terms of this agreement  we are required to make monthly payments based upon a year amortization and an interest rate equal to the sum of the bid side yield of a us treasury obligation having a maturity of january plus the prevailing ten year us treasury swap rate plus 
under the terms of a letter agreement signed at closing  we were provided with an option to modify the loan agreement by mutual consent or to prepay the outstanding principal balance without penalty 
as extended this option expires on march  as of december   the balance of this loan agreement is included in secured credit facilities on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet 
term debt in april  we completed a million term debt transaction 
the transaction covers the sale of million of floating rate asset backed notes  which are backed by a million diversified pool of commercial loans from our trs portfolio 
the offered notes represent of the collateral pool  and we retained an interest in the collateral pool 
the blended pricing for the offered notes excluding fees was one month libor plus basis points 
we used the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under certain of our credit facilities 
in september  we completed a billion term debt transaction that includes a three year replenishment period allowing us  subject to certain restrictions  to reinvest principal payments into new loan collateral from our trss

the outstanding balance of these senior notes and subordinate notes was million as of december  the accounting treatment of these two securitization transactions is further discussed in note  mortgage related receivables and related owners trust securitizations  and note  borrowings 
convertible debt we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due the march debentures and million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due july the july debentures  together with the march debentures  the debentures or contingent convertibles 
until march  the march debentures will bear interest at a rate of  after which time the debentures will not bear interest 
as of december   the march debentures are convertible  subject to certain conditions described below  into shares of our common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures 
the conversion rate will adjust each time we pay a dividend on our common stock  with the fair value of each adjustment taxable to the holders

see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion of these conditions 
to the extent that the respective conversion prices are adjusted below the price of our common stock at the time the debentures were issued  we would be required to record a beneficial conversion option which would impact both our net income and net income per share 
this has not occurred as of december  subordinated debt we periodically issue subordinated debt to statutory trusts tp trusts that are formed for the purpose of issuing preferred securities to outside investors  which we refer to as trust preferred securities tps 
we generally retain of the common securities issued by the tp trusts  representing of their total capitalization 
as of december   we had completed seven subordinated debt transactions  of which four bear interest at a floating interest rate and three bear fixed interest rates for a specified period and then bear interest at a floating interest rate until maturity 
the terms of the subordinated debt issued to the tp trusts and the tps issued by the tp trusts are substantially identical 
the subordinated debt is unsecured and ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of our other indebtedness 
debt covenant compliance capitalsource finance llc  one of our wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  services loans collateralizing our secured credit facilities and term debt and is required to meet various financial and non financial covenants 
failure to meet the covenants could result in the servicing being transferred to another servicer 
the notes under the trusts established in connection with our term debt include accelerated amortization provisions that require cash flows to be applied to pay the noteholders if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates 
we  and certain of our other wholly owned subsidiaries  also have certain financial and non financial covenants related to our unsecured credit facility  subordinated debt and our other debt financings 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
equity in march  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
in connection with this offering  we received net proceeds of million  which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities 
in march  we began offering a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drip to current and prospective shareholders 
participation in the drip allows common shareholders to reinvest cash dividends and to purchase additional shares of our common stock  in some cases at a discount from the market price 
during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million related to the purchase of million shares of our common stock pursuant to the drip 
in addition  we received proceeds of million related to cash dividends reinvested for million shares of our common stock during the year ended december  special purpose entities we use spes as an integral part of our funding activities 
we commonly service loans that we have transferred to these vehicles 
the use of these special purpose entities is generally required by our lenders in connection with our secured debt financings 
loans that we transfer to these vehicles are legally isolated from us including if we were to be in bankruptcy 
we also used special purpose entities to facilitate the issuance of collateralized loan obligation transactions that are further described in part i  item  business  of this annual report on form k 
additionally  we purchase beneficial ownership interests in residential mortgage assets that are held by special purpose entities established by third parties 
we evaluate all spes with whom we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities as defined by fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 fin r 
we consolidate these entities when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities which we determine that we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments 
as further discussed in note  mortgage related receivables and related owners trust securitizations  in february  we acquired beneficial interests in two special purpose entities that acquired and securitized pools of residential mortgage loans 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these spes and  therefore  consolidated the assets and liabilities of such entities for financial statement purposes 
additionally  and as further discussed in note  borrowings  the assets and related liabilities of all special purpose entities that we use to issue our term debt are recognized on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and commitments  guarantees contingencies as of december  and   we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively 
a discussion of these commitments is included in note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
the leases expire over the next ten years and contain provisions for certain annual rental escalations 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we had issued million in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next seven years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we had identified conditional asset retirement obligations primarily related to the future removal and disposal of asbestos that is contained within certain of our direct real estate investment properties 
for reasons further discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   no liability for conditional asset retirement obligations was recorded on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  one of our wholly owned indirect subsidiaries has provided a limited financial guarantee to a third party warehouse lender  which financed the purchase of million of commercial loans by a special purpose entity to which we provide advisory services in connection with its purchase of commercial loans 
we have provided the warehouse lender with a limited guarantee under which we agreed to assume a portion of net losses realized in connection with those loans held by the special purpose entity up to a specified loss limit 
this guarantee is due to expire on september  or earlier to the extent that the warehouse facility is refinanced prior to the guarantee s expiry 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we determined that we are not required to recognize the assets and liabilities of this special purpose entity for financial statement purposes as of december  in connection with certain securitization transactions  we typically make customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets 
prior to any securitization transaction  we perform due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
due to these procedures  we believe that the potential for loss is remote and therefore no liability is recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to these representations and warranties 
the outstanding loan balance related to these securitization transactions was approximately billion as of december  in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization vehicle 
from time to time we are party to legal proceedings 
we do not believe that any currently pending or threatened proceeding  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  including our cash flows 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases and we have committed to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  million to a joint venture and million to an equity investment 
the contractual obligations under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt are included in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  the expected contractual obligations under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt  subordinated debt  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december  were as follows unsecured non repurchase credit secured credit term convertible subordinated operating cancelable agreements facilities facilities debt debt debt leases contracts total in thousands thereafter total excludes net unamortized discounts of million 
the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities not considering optional annual renewals 
except for our series term debt and series a term debt a  the contractual obligations for term debt are based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loans held by the securitization trusts and an assumed constant prepayment rate of 
and a have replenishment periods that allow us  subject to certain restrictions  to reinvest principal payments into eligible new loan collateral and we assumed no prepayments would be made during these replenishment periods  but use a constant prepayment rate of once the replenishment period ends 
the underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which would shorten the life of the term debt transactions 
the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which will lengthen the life of the term debt transactions 
at our option  we may substitute new loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt transactions 
in addition  the contractual obligations for our term debt transactions are computed based on the initial call date 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date 
the legal maturity of the convertible debt is for further discussion of terms of our convertible debt and factors impacting their maturity see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities of the subordinated debt  which are between and we enter into derivative contracts under which we are required to either receive cash or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a borrower s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our lending and derivative portfolios 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the borrower  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding by an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on management s assessment of the client and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
we have established a credit committee to evaluate and approve credit standards and to oversee the credit risk management function related to our commercial loans and investments 
the credit committee s primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring conditions in real estate and other markets having an impact on lending activities  and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk 
commercial lending investment segment credit risk management for the commercial loan and investment portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same three factors credit  collateral  and financial performance 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the borrower s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  industry and single name concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a borrower s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we utilize syndication of exposure to other entities  loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio 
residential mortgage investment segment we are exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying the agency mbs  the non agency mbs  and the mortgage related receivables 
with respect to agency mbs  while we benefit from a full guaranty from fannie mae or freddie mac  variation in the level of credit losses may impact the duration of our investments since a credit loss results in the prepayment of the relevant loan by the guarantor 
with respect to non agency mbs  the value or performance of our investment may be impacted by higher levels of credit losses  depending on the specific provisions of the relevant securitizations 
with respect to mortgage related receivables  we are directly exposed to the level of credit losses on the underlying mortgage loans 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in commercial lending activities with borrowers primarily throughout the united states 
as of december  and  the entire loan portfolio was diversified such that no single borrower was greater than of the portfolio 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration was florida  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of the investments 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was florida  which made up approximately of the investments 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review  counterparty exposure limits and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from certain counterparties for amounts in excess of exposure limits and monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from a counterparty and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments was million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  and accordingly  our net exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans associated with our traditional lending activities and market risk mitigation activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans  residential mortgage investments and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in the economic value of our loans  and our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of various types of derivative instruments 
for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  interest rate risk management commercial lending investments segment interest rate risk in our commercial lending portfolio refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our commercial loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the prime or a libor based rate with almost all of our other loans bearing interest at a fixed rate 
the majority of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or commercial paper rates  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
the estimated changes in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our commercial lending portfolio as of december  were as follows estimated decrease increase in rate change net interest income basis points over months in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  we included related derivatives  excluded principal payments and assumed a advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our commercial loans had interest rate floors as of december  the loans with interest rate floors as of december  were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor below the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total we use interest rate swaps to economically hedge the risk of changes in fair value of certain fixed rate loans 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to economically hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to one month libor 
additionally  we use interest rate caps to economically hedge loans with embedded interest rate caps that are pledged as collateral for our term debt 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows in interest payments for subordinated debt underlying certain of our securities issuances 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to economically hedge changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate loans  which are not pledged to our term debt  and fixed rate investments 
we have also entered into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge anticipated loan syndications and foreign currency denominated loans we originate against foreign currency fluctuations 
these forward exchange contracts provide for a fixed exchange rate which has the effect of locking in the anticipated cash flows to be received from the loan syndication and the foreign currency denominated loans 
interest rate risk management residential mortgage investment segment we are exposed to changes in interest rates in our residential mortgage investment portfolio and related financings based on changes in the level and shape of the yield curve  volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayments 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
as interest rates increase  the market value of residential mortgage investments may decline while financing costs could rise  to the extent not mitigated by positions intended to economically hedge these movements 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  the market value of residential mortgage investments may increase while financing costs could decline  also to the extent not mitigated by positions intended to economically hedge these movements 
in addition  changes in the interest rate environment may affect mortgage prepayment rates 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  mortgage prepayment rates may decrease  thereby extending the duration of our investments 
the majority of our residential mortgage investments are collateralized with mortgages that have a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time followed by an adjustable rate period in which the adjustments are subject to annual and lifetime caps 
our liabilities include  with respect to rmbs and mortgage related receivables  repurchase agreements indexed to a short term interest rate market index such as libor and  with respect to mortgage related receivables only  securitized term debt financing through debt obligations secured by residential mortgage loans that have a similar initial fixed period followed by an adjustable period 
the estimated changes in fair value based on changes in interest rates applied to our residential mortgage investment portfolio as of december  were as follows estimated decrease rate change increase percentage of total basis points in fair value segment assets in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  our residential mortgage investment portfolio includes all of our investments in residential mortgage related receivables  agency mbs  term debt and related derivatives as of december  in connection with our residential mortgage investments and related financings  we follow a risk management program designed to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of our residential mortgage investments due to shifts in interest rates 
specifically  we seek to eliminate the effective duration gap associated with our assets and liabilities 
to accomplish this objective  we use a variety of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  swaptions and euro dollar futures contracts 
these derivative transactions convert the short term financing of our repurchase agreements to term financing matched to the expected duration of our residential mortgage investments 
to the extent necessary and based on established risk criteria  we will adjust the mix of financing and hedges as market conditions and asset performance evolves to maintain a close alignment between our assets and our liabilities 
in addition  we have contracted with an external investment advisor  blackrock financial management  inc  to provide analytical  risk management and other advisory services in connection with interest rate risk management on this portfolio 
critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management periodically performs detailed reviews of this portfolio to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan losses 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the commercial loan portfolio comprises large balance  non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired 
the allowance for loan losses is estimated by management based upon the borrower s overall financial condition  financial resources  payment history and  when applicable  the estimated realizable value of any collateral 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation for impairment of certain commercial and residential portfolios 
these allowances are based on historical experience  concentrations  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments 
certain considerations are made in relation to the length and severity of outstanding balances 
we generally do not factor in guarantees from our capital call agreements with our borrowers private equity sponsors in determining the overall allowance for loan losses 
however  when performing the sfas no 
analysis on an individual troubled loan  we do not consider any applicable borrower guarantees when calculating our potential for a specific loss 
the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and  therefore  net income 
in this case  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  iv adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  v considerations regarding domestic economic uncertainty  and vi overall credit conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we have assigned reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation were determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  whether the loan is underwritten based on the borrower s assets  real estate or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of basis points applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december  was as follows estimated increase change in reserve factors decrease in the basis points allowance for loan losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
we do not record an additional allowance for loan losses related to our commitments to lend as these amounts are generally subject to approval based on the adequacy of the underlying collateral or other terms and conditions  such as the borrower not being in default 
there also can be no assurance as to the amount  timing or even if such commitments will be funded 
once a commitment to lend is funded  the amount is included in our overall portfolio balance and considered in our determination of the allowance for loan losses 
fair value of certain financial instruments a portion of our assets are accounted for at fair value  which is defined in gaap as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between willing parties  other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
investments in debt securities that are classified as trading  as well as derivative instruments that are not designated in hedging relationships  are periodically adjusted to fair value through earnings 
investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income  while loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value 
additionally  the fair value of equity investments is estimated for purposes of assessing and measuring such assets for impairment purposes 
the estimation of fair values reflects our judgments regarding appropriate valuation methods and assumptions 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
for financial instruments that are actively traded in the marketplace or whose values are based on readily available market value data  little  if any  subjectivity is applied when determining the instrument s fair value 
when observable market prices and data do not exist  significant management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in those cases  small changes in assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation 
the financial instruments we hold that require the most complex judgments and assumptions involve equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and or are not publicly traded 
each of these investments is valued using an internally developed model 
this model utilizes industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ranging from three to ten times  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
we reduce this value by debt outstanding to arrive at an estimated equity value of the enterprise 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
income taxes we expect to formally make an election to reit status for under the code when we file our tax return for the year ended december  accordingly  we generally will not be subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that we derive from our reit qualifying activities 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  including any applicable alternative minimum tax 
we will still be subject to foreign  state and local taxation in foreign  state and local jurisdictions  including those in which we transact business or reside 
in order to estimate our corporate level income taxes as a reit  we must determine the amount of our net income derived from reit qualifying activities and the amount derived from our trss during the entire taxable year 
if our estimates of the source of the net income are not appropriate  income taxes could be materially different from amounts reported in our quarterly consolidated statements of income 
we will continue to be subject to corporate level tax on the earnings we derive from our trss 
as more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accrued income taxes  reported as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we consider many factors in filing income tax returns  including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance  in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  can materially affect our operating results for any given reporting period

equity price risk the debentures we issued in march are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
currently  each  of principal of the debentures is convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
prior to the effective date of eitf  we intend to make the irrevocable election to pay the principal balance of the debentures in cash upon any conversion or repurchase prior to or at their respective maturities 
holders of the debentures may convert their debentures prior to maturity only if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds  the trading price of the debentures falls below a specified threshold  the debentures have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur 
in addition  in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their debentures for of the principal amount 
concurrently with our sale of these debentures  we entered into two separate call option transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers  in each case originally covered the same number of shares as into which the debentures are convertible 
in one transaction  we purchased a call option at a strike price equal to the conversion price of the debentures  adjusted for the effect of dividends paid on our common stock 
this option expires on march  and requires physical settlement 
at the time we make the irrevocable election to pay the principal balance of the debentures in cash  we also intend to amend this option to provide that it may be settled in net shares so that the option continues to mirror the terms of the debentures 
we intend to exercise this call option from time to time as necessary to acquire shares that we may be required to deliver upon receipt of a notice of conversion of the debentures 
in the second transaction  we sold a call option to one of the initial purchasers for the purchase of up to million of our common shares at a strike price of approximately per share  adjusted for the effect of dividends paid on our common stock through december  this call option expires at various dates from march through june and must be settled in net shares 
the net effect of entering into these call option transactions was to minimize potential dilution as a result of the conversion of the debentures by increasing the effective conversion price of the debentures to a premium over the march  closing price of our common stock 
the call option transactions were settled at a net cost of approximately million  which we paid from the proceeds of our sale of the debentures and was included as a net reduction in shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
the debentures we issued in july are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
currently  each  of principal of the debentures is convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
prior to the effective date of eitf  we intend to make the irrevocable election to pay the principal balance of the debentures in cash upon any conversion or repurchase prior to or at their respective maturities 
holders of the debentures may convert their debentures prior to maturity only if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds  the trading price of the debentures falls below a specified threshold  the debentures have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur
