we are organized into two businesses the optical systems group and the distributed products group 
optical systems group the optical systems group designs  manufactures and sells highly precise systems  sub systems and components that are typically used in surveillance  long range observation  tracking and targeting and high performance imaging applications 
customers include both governmental and commercial organizations 
the optical systems group has design and manufacturing facilities in san diego  california  cullman  alabama  rochester hills  michigan  and nashua  new hampshire 
distributed products group the distributed products group distributes precision ball bearings  spherical plain bearings  and bushings  acquired from various domestic and international sources  to oems and mros 
additionally  the distributed products group designs  manufactures and sells mechanical bearing subassemblies for a variety of customers 
the distributed products group is comprised of the ast bearings division located in montville  new jersey  with a satellite distribution center in irvine  california 
facilities on april   we purchased a  square foot building and acres of land in nashua  new hampshire for million 
this facility serves as the consolidated manufacturing facility for our axsys technologies ir systems division  formerly operating at two facilities in new hampshire and massachusetts 
the relocation and the closure of the two existing facilities was completed in the fourth quarter of during  total pre tax costs associated with the relocation and facilities closures were approximately thousand  with an additional million of capital expenditures 
these costs included equipment relocation  employee training and facility improvements 
in addition  we recognized a thousand in expense for the cancellation of the existing salem facility lease 
share based compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of  we were required to record the expense of share based payment transactions pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  we were not required to restate the prior year financial statements or include in the current year any expenses related to stock option grants vested as of december  during the first quarter of  we reviewed our equity compensation program to determine the most appropriate equity award vehicles based on our objectives and new accounting and regulatory rules 
stock ownership guidelines  award types and award amounts were also reviewed to ensure market competitiveness 
as a result of this review  we began granting a mix of restricted stock and stock options to all eligible employees and directors 
prior to january   only stock option awards were granted 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   we had unamortized compensation expense of thousand associated with restricted stock awards  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining life of years 
the impact of sfas r on the statement of operations was as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses operating income net income diluted earnings per share public stock offering on september   we issued and sold  shares of common stock at the public offering price of per share 
we received all of the net proceeds from the offering after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions 
gross proceeds from the stock offering were million 
after underwriting discounts and commissions  we received million 
we utilized million to repay all of the amounts outstanding under our credit facility  including accrued interest and fees  and thousand to pay expenses related to the stock offering  and we used the remaining million for working capital and general corporate purposes 
significant customers bae systems  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  represented of our net sales in raytheon company  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  represented of our net sales in and in while bae  a prime contractor with the us government  does constitute a significant portion of our business  we do not currently believe that this is at risk business 
backlog and orders axsys recognized  in  bookings of million  ending the year with record backlog of million  of which will be shipped beyond months 
our backlog increased by million  or  compared to our ending backlog of million as of december  as we look forward  we expect continued growth in the optical systems group  which is supported by the segment s backlog of million at the end of this group will continue to target orders that require highly precise optical and motion control solutions 
examples include surveillance  military navigation and targeting  smart weapons  and medical imaging 
acquisition of diversified optical products  inc on may   we acquired all of the stock of diop  a manufacturer of high end thermal camera systems and lenses  for million in cash plus million of legal  audit and other acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition of diop brought us new  high value technologies  leveraged our existing infrared and motion control technologies  and provided us with a new base of customers 
further  the combination of diop and axsys positioned us as a leading independent infrared lens manufacturer 
at the time of the acquisition  diop employed approximately people at its salem  new hampshire headquarters 
diop is doing business as axsys technologies ir systems and the financial results are included in our optical systems group s results 
in connection with the acquisition of diop  on may   we also entered into a new million credit facility with fleet bank 
the credit facility consisted of a five year term loan a in the amount of million  a two year term loan b in the amount of million and a three year revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million 
borrowings under this credit facility provided a portion of the consideration used to acquire diop 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  we used the net proceeds from the stock offering to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the term loan b 
in addition to repaying term loan b  we also repaid in full the amounts outstanding under the term loan a with the net proceeds of the stock offering 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit acquisition of telic optics  inc on april   we acquired all of the stock of telic  a manufacturer of infrared optical products 
the financial results of telic are included in our optical systems group s results 
telic s broad infrared optics capabilities increase our product offerings and complement our strong position in reflective optical solutions 
in addition  telic s products are typically used in ground and sea based programs 
this complements our historical focus on air and space based programs and expands our overall market and program penetration 
finally  the complementary addition of telic s technical capabilities to our core technical strengths broadens our technical offering to prime contractors who are seeking to outsource the fulfillment of their optical requirements 
the initial purchase price of this acquisition  after a working capital adjustment of thousand  was million with an additional earn out payment of up to million over months following the closing date based on the achievement of certain revenue goals 
of this additional earn out payment  million was earned in and will be paid out in and million was earned in and subsequently paid in this increased the purchase price to million at december  included in the purchase price was thousand of legal  audit and other acquisition related expenses that were incurred in connection with the acquisition 
we funded the purchase price and associated transaction costs through a combination of existing cash balances and outside bank financing 
james webb space telescope since  we received million of orders from ball aerospace and technology corporation  including the original contract and change orders  to produce the optical mirror substrates for the james webb space telescope  or jwst 
the contract contains million of production sales and million for facilitization 
we recognized revenue of million in  million in and million in under the percentage of completion method of accounting related to the jwst project 
the jwst  which is currently expected to launch in  will replace the hubble as nasa s premier space telescope 
northrop grumman is the prime contractor 
the primary mirror is comprised of individual lightweight beryllium segments  all of which will be fabricated by axsys 
because of the large size of the primary mirror  jwst will be significantly more sensitive than ground based infrared telescopes  enabling it to search for the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe billions of years ago 
our contract includes the production of optical substrates for an engineering development unit  primary mirror segments  spare mirrors and support structures 
as of december   we delivered of the primary mirror segments 
we expect to ship the final units in results of segment operations the following tables and discussion set forth selected financial information from continuing operations on a segment basis for the years ended december   and the segment tables  shown below  exclude one time charges  which are shown separately 
optical systems group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the optical systems group segment increased for the year ended december  compared to  while sales in this segment increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase in sales compared to was primarily due to increased demand for our infrared product lines 
the success of our thermal imaging cameras and lenses in military and homeland security surveillance and targeting applications continues to drive our revenue growth 
the increase in sales compared to sales was due to both the addition of a new revenue stream related to the acquisition of diop and continued organic growth year over year  primarily from our infrared product lines 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  remained comparable to the higher sales volume during did not generate incremental margin as we continued to increase our participation on large military programs  which generally carry lower than average margins 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for compared to increased mainly due to increased volume  improved sales mix related to our infrared business and improved efficiencies in comparison to the prior year 
the optical systems group  as of december   had a backlog of definitive orders of million  of which is expected to ship beyond the fiscal year 
distributed products group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the distributed products group increased for the year ended december  compared to  while sales decreased for the year ended december  comparable to sales increased during compared to mainly due to increased activity of new and existing products from some of our larger customers 
during  revenues remained consistent when compared to despite increased pricing pressures and competition 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  for was slightly higher than gross profit in the same period in the prior year mainly due to favorable product mix and a reduction in anti dumping duty rates 
for  gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was lower than gross profit in the comparable period in year mainly due to competitive pricing pressures  continued increasing freight costs and increased anti dumping duty rates that were not reflected in our pricing  which was include in our backlog coming into the year 
operating expenses table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  were million in compared to million in and million in sg a spending during was higher than spending during several factors contributed to the increases 
during  we implemented sfas r for share based compensation expensing  which cost totaled million 
additional costs associated with having diop for a full year compared to eight months in were estimated to be million 
we incurred thousand of move related expenses associated with the consolidation of our ir systems divisions 
we incurred thousand of additional professional costs in compared to as a result of anti dumping duty issues associated with our distributed products group and other legal matters associated with the ordinary course of business 
lastly  we spent an additional million across several expense categories associated with the general growth of the business 
the spending increase from to was primarily due to the acquisition of diop and the incremental expenses associated with a full year of expense for telic compared to nine months of expense in diop incurred million of sg a expenses in  while telic incurred an incremental thousand of sg a costs compared to the prior year as a result of a full year of operation 
amortization expense totaled thousand in as compared to thousand in sg a spending  as a percentage of sales  remained comparable to spending in the prior years despite the adoption of fas r and the move related costs associated with consolidation of our ir systems division 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased by thousand and million compared to and  respectively 
this was primarily a result of our infrared product line 
this product line is research intensive as we continuously make improvements on products to ensure competitiveness in the imaging market place 
our legacy product lines are primarily manufactured and sold to oems based on their unique design specifications 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense was thousand in the year ended december   compared to million in and thousand in the lower interest expense was due to lower overall borrowings on our revolving credit facility during compared to borrowings in the increase in expense in compared to was primarily due to interest on our million term loan incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of diop  which was partially offset by lower interest paid on capital leases compared to interest income 
interest income was thousand in the year ended december  compared to thousand in and thousand in interest income was primarily composed of income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase year over year was primarily due to overall higher interest rates on higher than average cash on hand 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in conjunction with our prepayment of the principal and accrued interest on the million term loan a and the million term loan b during  we incurred a charge of thousand for the write off of loan origination fees and a charge of thousand for the early termination of the related interest rate swap agreement 
other income and expense  net 
net other expense in was thousand compared to net other income of thousand in and net other expense of thousand in other income and expense were composed primarily of the gains and losses incurred as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses and the disposal of capital equipment 
income taxes 
the consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in and in the effective rate for was impacted by the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is not required at december  as it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized in the future 
discontinued operations 
in  we recognized an after tax charge of thousand related to legal and consulting expenses in conjunction with an environmental clean up site of a discontinued operation 
during  axsys disposed of the automation group  which included facilities in wilmington  massachusetts and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
at the time of the sale  axsys continued to be responsible for fulfilling the remaining terms of the leases 
as of december   we fulfilled all of our contractual obligations related to these sites and we recognized an after tax gain of thousand on the reversal of an accrual associated with these leases 
in  we incurred an after tax charge of thousand from the settlement of the prospect  connecticut environmental claim related to a previously divested operation 
as of december   we had no further responsibility to the epa as it relates to this site 
in  we recognized an additional loss reserve in conjunction with the sale of the automation group 
the after tax charge of represents rental expenses for the two facilities within the automation group 
in addition  during  we recognized an after tax charge thousand for an environmental related expense for previously divested operations 
net income 
we had net income of million  or per diluted share  in  net income of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in in addition  we issued  shares of common stock through a public stock offering in september  which impacted earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
we have maintained a high level of liquidity as evidenced by our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities  which was as of december  and as of december  maintaining this current ratio supports our goal to maintain a high level of liquidity to seek growth opportunities 
during  we borrowed and subsequently repaid million under our revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 
the million revolving credit facility remains available through may  subject to optional prepayment in accordance with its terms 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be utilized to issue letters of credit 
we may elect to have any borrowing under the revolving credit facility bear interest either at the bank s prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin of to basis points  depending on our consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio 
we have the option of selecting the month  month  month or month libor rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  as of december   million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including covenants regarding minimum ebitda  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
net cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization  million of share based compensation expense  thousand decrease in our net deferred income tax asset and thousand of other non cash items 
in addition  we spent thousand on discontinued operations primarily for leases and environmental clean up activities 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we utilized million of cash to fund an increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of increased sales volume 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our inventories  which resulted from long lead time orders and increased sales by our optical systems group  which was partially offset by the timing of vendor invoices and payments resulting in a million increase to accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accrued liabilities increased an additional million as a result of higher excess of billings over costs of million associated with percentage of completion accounting and additional compensation related expenses of million 
accrued liabilities decreased during by thousand as a result of lower income tax payable  warranty reserves  accrued professional fees and other miscellaneous accruals 
additional cash outflows of thousand were for the reduction of deferred income as we completed some long lead time orders 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization  million decrease in our net deferred income tax asset and thousand of other non cash items 
in addition  we spent thousand on discontinued operations primarily for leases and environmental clean up activities 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our inventories  which resulted from long lead time orders and increased sales from our optical systems group 
we also utilized thousand of cash to fund an increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of unbilled receivables generated by service contracts and excess of cost over billings on percentage of completion accounting 
additional cash outflows of thousand were primarily for the utilization of loss contract reserves  legal and consulting costs associated with environmental activities and the reduction of deferred income as we completed some long lead time orders 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization and a thousand non cash charge related to the modification of stock option grants for a terminated employee 
these non cash charges were partially offset by non cash benefits  including a million increase in our net deferred income tax assets  due to the utilization and reversal of a valuation allowance for these assets 
we also paid out thousand for liabilities related to discontinued operations  which was offset by an additional accrual for discontinued operations of thousand 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our accounts receivable  which resulted from sales growth and higher deferred income billings in our optical solutions group 
we also utilized million to fund inventory growth in the inventory growth was related to certain large long term programs in our optical systems group 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
the increase in deferred income was the result of our strategy to actively negotiate progress payments into certain large dollar contracts for long lead time products and long term programs 
this strategy helps to mitigate the near term negative cash impact of these contracts 
the net change in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other long term liabilities was a thousand increase 
the increase was related to increased accruals for compensation related expenses and an accrual for capital equipment that was received but not invoiced  which were partially offset by the liquidation of an inactive pension plan and the utilization of the reserve for loss contracts 
during  we also received a thousand federal income tax refund and a thousand decrease in current assets primarily due to the timing of insurance payments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in during  we utilized million of cash to purchase a new facility for our ir systems division and invested an additional million in capital improvements for the new facility 
we had additional capital expenditures of million in primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment used to support sales growth 
we also utilized million of cash in for the telic earn out payment 
during  we also received thousand of proceeds from the sale of fully depreciated machinery 
we utilized million to acquire diop in and million to acquire telic in the purchase of telic was partially funded by the sale of million of short term investment securities 
capital expenditures were million during and million during in  we constructed a  square foot  climate controlled manufacturing facility in cullman  alabama 
financing activities provided thousand of cash in  million in and million in during  we borrowed and subsequently repaid million under our revolving credit facility 
we also received thousand in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and recorded a tax benefit of thousand related to the exercise of non qualified stock options 
during  we borrowed million to purchase diop and paid off million of financing related to the acquisition of telic in april in addition  we completed a public stock offering of  shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds of million during the third quarter of in  we made a million principal payment and utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the public stock offering to prepay the remaining million outstanding under our credit facility 
during  we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and paid off the remaining thousand of capital lease obligations 
during  we obtained a million term loan for the acquisition of telic and received thousand in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these sources of funds were partially offset by repayments of thousand on the term loan and thousand on our capital leases 
with our existing cash balance  anticipated cash flows from operations and the million revolving credit facility  management believes that axsys has sufficient liquidity to finance its operations  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
shareholders equity was million  or per common share issued  at december  compared to million  or per common share issued  at december  the increase in shareholders equity was due primarily to net income of million 
most of the remaining increase in shareholders equity was related to share based compensation and the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated single purpose entities 
contracts and commitments we have entered into certain contractual obligations  which will result in material cash outlays over the next several years 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for capital leases  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total as of december   we had operating lease commitments for all of our facilities  with the exception of our cullman  alabama and nashua  new hampshire facilities  which are owned 
in addition  our operating lease commitments included leases on some office equipment 
as of december   we had various purchase obligations  which include uninvoiced inventory receipts  capital equipment commitments  long distance phone service and other commitments 
incorporated in other long term obligations are commitments related to environmental remediation plans and building leases associated with discontinued operations and employee benefit obligations 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at three sites  which include one site that is in the final stage of monitoring 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of december   we determined that it was probable that we would incur approximately thousand of remediation and monitoring costs  of which thousand is included in current liabilities and thousand is in other long term liabilities 
as of december   we were contingently liable for million under outstanding letters of credit 
we have issued letters of credit for certain business transactions including insurance programs and customer deposits 
as of december   we had one pension plan for which benefits and participation have been frozen 
pension benefits under this plan are generally based upon years of service and compensation 
the plan is an unfunded plan with an annual payout of approximately thousand 
in december of  we signed an agreement to lease an additional  square feet of office space in rocky hill  connecticut for our corporate headquarters 
the lease is contingent upon the completion of certain renovations  which are scheduled to be completed in february critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  contingencies  bad debts  warranties  environmental remediation efforts and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture or distribute products  which are either components or subassemblies that are sold to other manufacturers or oems 
we do not sell any finished products directly to consumers 
therefore  we are generally not responsible for any installation or customer training 
however  some of our contracts are subject to customer acceptance and generally the customer will inspect and accept the product at our facility prior to shipment 
generally  legal title passes to the customer upon shipment 
however  occasionally product is shipped fob destination 
when the product is shipped fob destination  revenues are not recognized until the customer receives the product 
our policy is to recognize revenues when a product is either shipped to or received by the customer based on the terms of the specific sale 
however  certain long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion model 
revenues and estimated gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials and overhead 
these contracts require judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
contract changes are included when the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we may receive progress payments that exceed costs incurred on these long term contracts 
such advances are recognized as billings in excess of costs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income primarily results from the advance billings to our customers for the cost of beryllium  known as material only billings 
these material only billings are deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue only when the associated finished product is shipped 
certain contracts are accounted for under the service contract model 
under these contracts  revenues are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
due to the build to order nature of our products  except for the distribution of ball bearings and the manufacture of infrared cameras  we do not offer price protection and generally do not offer discounts 
to the extent discounts are offered  they are reflected at the time of the sale as a reduction in revenues 
the price is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order 
when customer change orders occur  any pricing changes are reflected in a revised purchase order 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over ninety days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish an allowance based on experience and discussion with customers 
historically  our estimated allowance has approximated actual write offs 
however  actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change for example  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts receivable are written off only when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our markets are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine our inventory to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
historically  our estimate of inventory reserves has approximated actual results 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the cost of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as part of the purchase price allocation for our acquired businesses  identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the values assigned to acquired identifiable intangible assets are determined  as of the date of acquisition  based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after tax cash flows from those assets over their lives  including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales  less a cost of capital charge  all of which is discounted to present value 
the value assigned to goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable acquired assets  both tangible and intangible  less liabilities assumed 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas requires that goodwill be tested  at a minimum  annually for each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation approach  which is dependent on estimates for future operating results  working capital changes  and capital expenditures  as well as expected growth rates for cash flows and long term interest rates 
a decline in future operating results or a change in our discount rate in in the future could result in a change in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and result in an impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
loss contract reserves 
generally  our customer contracts are completed within one year of receiving the order 
however  occasionally  longer lead time orders are received and we monitor these contracts periodically to determine if our actual costs are comparable to our cost estimates used at the time of order acceptance 
if we determine that our actual costs are significantly exceeding our original estimates  we will record a loss contract reserve 
currently  one long term contract is covered by a loss contract reserve 
we accrued for this contract based on the contract price and the current cost structure  including estimated cost increases 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in two environmental remediation projects and one site that is in the final stage of monitoring 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for cleanup is determined and costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when costs are not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is made 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
although our estimates to date have proven to be accurate  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based on an analysis of historical data and is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results from operations could be impacted share based compensation 
we elected to use a black scholes merton option pricing model to value stock options that were granted subsequent to our adoption of statement r 
the model includes various assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions are based on historical information regarding grants  exercises and cancellations 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of axsys

accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not more than likely  we are required to establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period  we are required to include this amount as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of the taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
under fin  the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering time values 
fin substantially changes the applicable accounting model and is likely to cause greater volatility in income statements as more items are recognized discretely within income tax expense 
fin also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive  annual tabular rollfoward of the unrecognized tax benefits 
fin must be adopted no later than january  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and expect to adopt fin effective january  in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which requires us to expense share based payments  including employee stock options  based on their fair value 
we adopted sfas r on january  we discuss our adoption of sfas r and the adoption s effects in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costing  or sfas  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas requires that those amounts  if abnormal  be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
in addition  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted sfas during the first quarter of the adoption did not have a material impact on our earnings or financial position
