item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview we are a leading provider of outdoor machine vision systems and sensors that optimize the flow of traffic and enhance driver safety 
using our proprietary software and its industry expertise  we provide video sensor systems  transportation management and traveler information systems and other engineering and consulting services to the its industry 
we use our outdoor image recognition software expertise to develop proprietary algorithms for video sensor systems that improve vehicle safety and the flow of traffic 
using our knowledge of the its industry  we design and implement transportation management systems that help public agencies reduce traffic congestion and provide greater access to traveler information 
our vantage product is a video vehicle sensing system that detects the presence of vehicles on roadways 
vantage systems are used at signalized intersections to enable a more efficient allocation of green signal time and are also used for incident detection and highway traffic data collection applications 
we sell and distribute our vantage products primarily to commercial customers and municipal agencies 
our autovue ldw systems consist of a small windshield mounted sensor that uses proprietary software to detect and warn drivers of unintended lane departures 
approximately  production autovue ldw units have been sold for truck and car platforms in the north american  european markets and asian markets 
our autovue ldw systems are currently offered as an option on certain mercedes benz  man  iveco  daf  scania  international and freightliner trucks 
in japan  our ldw system is a standard feature on certain fuso heavy truck models 
we provide an aftermarket kit to service the growing number of heavy truck fleet customers in north america 
using our aftermarket kit  our ldw systems can be installed on a variety of heavy trucks such as freightliner  volvo  kennworth  peterbilt  international and mack 
in september  we entered into an agreement with valeo  pursuant to which we granted valeo the exclusive right to sell and manufacture our autovue ldw systems to the worldwide passenger car market in exchange for royalty payments for each autovue ldw unit sold 
to date  royalty payments from valeo have totaled approximately  pursuant to this agreement  we also generate revenues from valeo by providing specific contract engineering services  technical marketing and sales support to valeo related to passenger car development activites and to enable the launch of our ldw on certain infiniti vehicles 
valeo is currently in discussions to provide our ldw system to other passenger car oems  however  we cannot assure you that such discussions will be successful 
we plan to continue to provide technical marketing and sales support to valeo in our efforts to win new oem customers for the passenger car market  as well as contract engineering services related to the possible launch of new infiniti platforms that include our ldw system 
we believe that autovue is a broad sensor platform that  through additional software development  may be expanded to incorporate additional safety and convenience features 
our transportation management systems business includes transportation engineering and consulting services focused on the planning  design  development and implementation of software based systems that integrate sensors  video surveillance  computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor  control and direct traffic flow  assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews and distribute real time information about traffic conditions 
our services include planning  design and implementation of surface transportation infrastructure systems 
we perform analysis and study goods movement  commercial vehicle operations  travel demand forecasting and systems engineering and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion 
these services and systems are primarily sold to local  state and national transportation agencies in the united states 
our transportation management systems business is largely dependent upon governmental funding and budgetary issues 
the federal highway bill that was passed in august provided for a significant increase in transportation funding over the following six years 
the recent growth in our transportation management systems business and our vantage product business has been enabled in part by this bill  as well as by state transportation bonds such as the billion infrastructure bond passed in california in november historically  there have been significant delays between the passage of funding bills and the allocation of related funding to specific contracts 
accordingly  while we have seen an increase in activity following the passage of the federal highway bill  we cannot currently predict the full impact that this bill or state bonds will have on our transportation management systems business 
we anticipate that the success of our transportation systems business will continue to be dependent in part on government spending and the budgetary process 
we have historically operated multiple business units 
during the fiscal year ended march  fiscal  we operated in three segments consisting of its  video products  and telecom products 
the its segment consisted of our current operations  which was previously conducted by the iteris subsidiary 
the video products segment consisted of our former wholly owned subsidiaries  maxxess systems  inc maxxess  previously known as gyyr incorporated  which designed and manufactured security management systems  and broadcast  inc broadcast  which developed and supplied software based systems to automate and control the multiple classes of equipment used in broadcast studios and satellite uplink facilities 
our telecom segment consisted of our wholly owned subsidiary  zyfer  inc zyfer  which developed and manufactured timing and synchronization products and which  prior to its incorporation  was operated as our communications division 
beginning in fiscal  we divested of certain of our business units in order to reduce our operating expenses and to focus on the operations of our iteris subsidiary 
these divestitures and related restructuring activities included the following transactions in march  we ceased the development and sale of any new broadcast products  and in september  we sold the balance of our broadcast business 
in may  we sold the assets of zyfer for a purchase price of million in cash and the assumption of liabilities  plus incentive payments based on the revenues generated by the sale of zyfer s products or the license of its technologies through april in october  we received an incentive payment of  related to the twelve month period ended april   and in september  we received an incentive payment of  related to the twelve month period ended april  in september  we sold substantially all of the assets of maxxess to an investor group that included one of our directors and certain members of the maxxess management group 
the consideration for the sale consisted of the assumption of million of liabilities  resulting in a net gain of million on this sale 
subsequent to the sale  in  another member of our board of directors became the ceo of maxxess 
we currently sublease to maxxess  square feet of space in our anaheim facility 
the sublease will terminate in september concurrently with the termination of the master lease for our anaheim facility 
in may  we repurchased all of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock of the iteris subsidiary for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash  and we purchased  shares of the iteris subsidiary common stock from daimlerchrysler ventures gmbh dcv in consideration for the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
we financed the purchase price for the iteris subsidiary series a preferred stock through the issuance of convertible debentures in the original principal amount of million  a million term note payable to our bank and million in cash 
in june  we issued million shares of our common stock valued at million at the date of issuance in exchange for an aggregate of million shares of common stock of the iteris subsidiary  which had the effect of reducing the residual minority interest in our iteris subsidiary to 
in october  we merged the iteris subsidiary into us and the remaining minority interest in the iteris subsidiary consisting of million shares of common stock of the iteris subsidiary was converted to million shares of our common stock valued at million at the merger date 
immediately following the merger  we converted all of our outstanding class b common stock  shares into million shares of our common stock which was formerly designated as class a common stock 
in connection with this merger  we also assumed options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of million and  shares  respectively  of the common stock of the iteris subsidiary  which became options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of million and  shares  respectively  of our common stock 
in october  we amended our certificate of incorporation to a change the voting rights of our class a common stock from one tenth to one vote per share  b remove the ability to issue any further shares of class b common stock  and c rename our class a common stock to common stock 
as a result  we currently have only one class of capital stock outstanding  the common stock 
our financial statements for all periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the operations of broadcast  zyfer and maxxess 
we currently operate in three reportable segments roadway sensors  automotive sensors and transportation systems 
the roadway sensors segment includes our vantage vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 
the automotive sensors segment is comprised of all activities related to our autovue ldw systems for vehicle safety 
the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenues and related costs of sales upon transfer of title  which is generally upon shipment or  if required  upon acceptance by the customer  provided that we believe collectibility of the net sales amount is reasonably assured 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
contract revenues include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits determined using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
in addition to product and contract revenues  we derive revenue from technology access fees  the provision of specific non recurring contract engineering services related to our autovue ldw systems  and royalties related to unit sales of our autovue ldw systems by our strategic partner valeo to the passenger car market 
technology access fee revenues are recognized evenly over the period in which they are earned 
non recurring contract engineering revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed 
royalty revenues are recorded based on unit sales of our products by valeo and are recognized in the period in which such sales occur 
technology access fee revenues  contract engineering revenues and royalty revenues are included in net sales 
revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by periodically reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record reserves for receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general reserve based on our historical collections experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we provide reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed anticipated future demand 
it is possible that reserves over and above those already established may be required in the future if market conditions for our products deteriorate 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter at the reporting unit level unless a change in circumstances indicates that more frequent impairment analysis is required 
impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units with the recorded goodwill 
fair value is determined by using the income approach methodology of valuation which utilizes discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our current budget and our current strategic plan  subject to modification as considered necessary  including sales and expense growth rates and the discount rates we estimate to represent our cost of funds 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of goodwill  we could incur impairment charges 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which may adversely affect our operating results 
taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and earnings during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
the changes described in the preceding sentence and adjustments to our valuation allowance may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
stock based compensation 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective april  prior to april   we followed the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and  accordingly  accounted for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and related interpretations 
sfas r requires all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations as an expense  based on their grant date fair values with such fair values amortized over the requisite service period 
we elected to utilize the modified prospective method for the transition to sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  under the modified prospective method  compensation expense will be recognized for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   based on grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas in implementing sfas r  we have used the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock based awards granted subsequent to april  our assumptions under the bsm formula include the following expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock price  the expected life of options is derived based on the historical life of our options  and the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury interest rates in effect at the time of grant 
additionally  sfas did not require the estimation of forfeitures in the calculation of stock compensation expense  however  sfas r does require such estimation and upon adoption of sfas r  we changed our methodology to include an estimate of forfeitures 
future stock based compensation expense in any particular quarter or year could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues for the periods indicated 
the following table should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal year ended march  net sales and contract revenues net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues costs of net sales and contract revenues cost of net sales a cost of contract revenues a gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative a research and development a amotization of intangible assets deferred compensation expense benefit disposal of fixed assets acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss non operating income expense other income expense  net interest expense  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit minority interest in earnings of subsidiary net income loss a includes stock based compensation expense as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues as follows cost of net sales cost of contract revenues selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense total stock based compensation expense years ended march   and net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of roadway sensors sales  which are derived from sales of our vantage video detection systems  and automotive sensors sales  which are derived from sales of autovue ldw systems  technology access fees  contract engineering revenue and royalty revenue generated from autovue related activities 
contract revenues consist entirely of transportation systems contract revenues  which are generated from systems integration and its consulting services with federal  state  county and municipal agencies 
we currently have a diverse customer base with our largest customer constituting of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal total net sales and contract revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net sales in each of the periods reflected increased unit sales in both roadway sensors and automotive sensors 
roadway sensors net sales comprised  and of net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively and increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the majority of roadway sensors net sales were derived from sales within north america 
the fiscal increase was primarily due to higher unit sales of vantage video detection systems  which reflected broader market acceptance of video based detection technologies and positive reaction to new vantage product offerings such as color cameras and eaccess  as well as higher governmental spending  which we believe was related to the passage of the federal highway bill in august the fiscal increase was primarily due to increased market adoption of video based detection technologies for traffic intersection management and our ability to obtain additional contracts with state departments of transportation 
in fiscal  we experienced increased lead times in procuring components  a trend that we expect to continue and which could adversely affect our sales in the future 
net sales from automotive sensors products and services increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal net sales of automotive sensors products and services was primarily related to increased unit sales of ldw systems in the north american commercial heavy truck market 
while overall unit sales of our autovue ldw systems increased in fiscal  automotive sensors net sales were negatively affected by oem volume discounts provided to our largest customer and the impact of the transition to our next generation autovue ldw systems for the heavy truck market in the latter part of fiscal the fiscal increase in automotive sensors net sales was largely due to increased ldw unit sales in the european and north american commercial heavy truck markets  which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal although we have seen increased unit sales of autovue ldw systems in recent fiscal years  automotive sensors unit sales in fiscal could be adversely impacted by slower than expected adoption rates of our ldw system by european and asian oem s and north american heavy truck fleets  as well as potential additional oem volume discounts 
additionally  recent environmental regulations in europe and north america have substantially increased the cost of new commercial trucks  which could impact future truck sales volumes and  ultimately  unit sales of our ldw systems 
royalty revenues from valeo for sales of our ldw systems for the passenger car market remained relatively insignificant in fiscal our ldw systems are now offered as an option on three infiniti models 
while valeo is currently in discussions to offer our ldw systems on other passenger car platforms  we cannot assure you that valeo will be successful in these efforts 
contract revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal contract revenues reflect a broad range of fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts for engineering study and design  systems integration and system implementation 
all of our contract revenue is currently derived from work performed in north america 
contract revenues are dependent upon the continued availability of funding at both the state and federal levels from the various departments of transportation 
we believe the increase in fiscal contract revenues compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal was largely the result of the passage of the federal highway bill in august  as well as increased spending at the state and local levels 
the increase in contract revenues in fiscal was also due to continued growth in the california market and stronger sales in the eastern us market 
in response to the growth in our transportation systems segment  we have increased our transportation systems staff by in fiscal we expect to continue to increase our transportation systems staff over the next fiscal year 
we believe the ability of our transportation systems business to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total gross profit as a percent of net sales and contract revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and increased in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the basis point decrease in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to volume discounts given to our largest automotive sensors hardware customer as well as an overall decline in unit volumes to this customer 
fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our roadway sensors division were relatively consistent with fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
we limit quantitative discussion of gross profit for our roadway sensors and automotive sensors segments for competitive reasons 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on customer mix and volume discounts given  as well as possible shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities which we record as cost of goods sold 
gross profit as a percent of net sales has fluctuated over the last five years from a high of in fiscal to a low of in fiscal the basis point increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of increased margins on roadway sensors products due to product improvements aimed at reducing the cost of goods sold  production efficiencies as a result of higher unit sales and a change in our roadway sensors business model in california to a direct sales model 
additionally  fiscal cost of net sales included  of stock based compensation compared to  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of contract revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and increased from in fiscal we recognize contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
the decrease in gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a contract mix weighted more toward lower margin contracts in the period 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was largely a result of the inclusion of million of stock based compensation in the cost of contract revenues in fiscal compared to  in fiscal by comparison   of stock based compensation was included in fiscal cost of contract revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly a result of higher commissions associated with increased roadway sensors net sales and increased sales and marketing activities in our transportation systems segment 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expense included legal expenses associated with the settlement of litigation described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  a severance accrual of approximately  associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer in march and  related to the write off of past due accounts receivable related to rent and other services provided to our former subsidiary  maxxess 
no further expense is expected to be incurred in connection with the aforementioned lawsuit or the severance arrangement with our former chief executive officer 
severance payments to our former chief executive officer will be made over a one year period 
we have written off all balances receivable from maxxess based on our accounts receivable accounting policy and will continue to work with maxxess to collect amounts due to us 
certain members of our board of directors are part of maxxess management and ownership 
in the coming quarters  we anticipate increased selling  general and administrative expense related to our efforts to comply with the internal control attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  with which we must begin to comply in april the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely a result of a million charge for stock based compensation incurred in fiscal  compared to stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal  additional accounting and legal fees incurred in the first and second quarter of fiscal related to a change in audit firms  costs incurred in anticipation of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  additional common area charges incurred in connection with our anaheim headquarters  and increased outside sales commissions in our roadway sensors business 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely a result of higher than anticipated costs in the prior year period in automotive sensors as we expended significant development resources in qualifying the next generation ldw system with our largest customer  as well as several other heavy truck oems 
additionally  in fiscal  there was a shift in engineering resources from research and development activities to product support activities as a result of new product introductions and improvements in roadway sensors 
costs associated with product support activities are included in cost of net sales rather than research and development expense 
we plan to introduce several key products in our roadway sensors division in fiscal and expect research and development expenses to increase slightly from fiscal levels 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly a result of million of stock based compensation charged to research and development expense in fiscal compared to stock based compensation of  in fiscal this effect was offset by increased spending in fiscal for both our vantage video detection products and our autovue ldw system for the heavy truck market 
additional development funds were allocated to the roadway sensors business in fiscal to complete the development of new products that were introduced in fiscal  refresh the existing product line and enhance cost reduction activities 
additional funds allocated to the automotive sensors business were primarily used to develop and qualify the next generation autovue ldw system for the heavy truck market in europe and north america 
for competitive reasons  we closely guard the confidentiality of specific development projects 
deferred compensation expense benefit 
deferred compensation expense benefit represents changes in the fair value of assets  primarily shares of our common stock  held by our deferred compensation savings plan under which certain senior executives may defer compensation 
prior to the merger of the iteris subsidiary into us in fiscal  the plan held shares of iteris subsidiary common stock 
in connection with the fiscal merger of the iteris subsidiary into us  shares of iteris subsidiary common stock held by the plan were exchanged for shares of our common stock 
changes in the value of common stock held by the plan resulted in a benefit of  in fiscal  expense of  in fiscal and a benefit of  in fiscal no compensation was deferred into the plan in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net reflects the following year ended march  in thousands settlement of lawsuits other other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal primarily reflects  of expense recorded in connection with the settlement of litigation in july other income expense  net in fiscal primarily reflects a  gain recognized on the settlement of litigation in which we were a beneficiary of  but not a party to  litigation between rockwell international and the michigan department of transportation 
refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these settlements 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net reflects the net of interest expense and interest income as follows year ended march  in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly related to the october banking change  in which we refinanced our existing term note and line of credit with a new bank 
in connection with this refinancing  we also increased our credit facility by million from million to million  which resulted in slightly higher interest costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense  net in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly related to an increase in the interest rate on our line of credit and term note as well as increased average borrowings on our line of credit 
income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million and at march   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
the ability to record the deferred tax asset was based on the more likely than not criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of  and at march   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a section limitation estimated at approximately million annually which can be utilized to offset federal consolidated taxable income 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards and the valuation allowance we have recorded against our net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets will cause us to have future income tax payments and income tax expense that are substantially lower than the income tax liability and income tax expense calculated using statutory tax rates 
minority interest in earnings of subsidiary 
minority interest in earnings of subsidiary represents the minority stockholders share of the iteris subsidiary s net income loss combined with the accretion of the redemption preference of the iteris subsidiary s series a preferred stock 
on october   we completed the merger of the iteris subsidiary into us 
as a result of the completion of the merger in october  we did not incur any charge for minority interest subsequent to that date 
no future charges for minority interest are anticipated 
stock based compensation expense 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective approach 
stock based compensation expense was  in fiscal see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our implementation of sfas r 
as discussed above and in the overview to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  on october   we completed the merger of the iteris subsidiary into us 
upon completion of the merger  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense related to the assumption and exchange of vested stock options assumed in the merger 
additionally  stock based compensation expense was recorded subsequent to the merger date based on the vesting schedule of stock options that were not yet vested on the merger date 
this resulted in stock based compensation expense of  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
no additional stock based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with stock options assumed in the merger 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  should a shortfall occur  we believe we could obtain additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit and  in cash and cash equivalents 
this compares to working capital of million at march   which included borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit and  in cash and cash equivalents 
our operations used million of cash during fiscal  primarily as a result of investments in inventory due to sales growth and longer lead times in procuring certain compenents  and an increased level of net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings due to sales growth and the timing of invoicing on contracts in our transportation systems segment 
these were partially offset by net income of million 
during fiscal  our operations provided  of cash  primarily as a result of planned decreases in inventory and the timing of payments on accrued expenses and payables  which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  both as a result of sales growth 
we generated  in cash from operations in fiscal  primarily due to the receipt of  related to a legal settlement between rockwell international and the michigan department of transportation  to which we were a third party beneficiary 
investing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  which aggregated  million and  respectively 
in fiscal  capital expenditures increased significantly primarily due to hardware  software and related labor costs to implement a new enterprise resource management system  which was put into use at the beginning of fiscal cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  which was the net result of net payments on borrowings of million offset by cash inflows of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  approximately million of the million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants was raised through the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash as a result of net borrowings of  and cash inflows of  from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
during fiscal  financing activities used million of cash  which was comprised of net cash outflows of approximately million related to the merger activities described more fully above in the overview to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
borrowings the following table summarizes our borrowings and long term debt at march  in thousands revolving line of credit convertible debentures  net bank term note promissory note to landlord other long term debt in october  we refinanced our existing line of credit and entered into a new two year credit facility with our new bank 
the facility provides for combined line of credit and term note borrowings of up to million 
under the new credit facility  we may borrow against our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on borrowed amounts is payable monthly at the current stated prime rate plus
