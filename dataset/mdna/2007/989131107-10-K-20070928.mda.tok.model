critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting polices are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of a customer arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
sales are 
table of contents not conditional based on customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
the company primarily utilizes independent manufacturers representatives to facilitate sales orders with no right of return or other company obligation  as well as having direct sales for key accounts or product lines 
the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to the customer 
the company accounts for customer rebates on the accrual basis when they are probable and can be estimated 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based upon historical experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate based on specifically identified accounts 
the company evaluates specific accounts where information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations is known 
in these cases  management uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
such a change in estimated recoverability would be accounted for in the period in which the facts that give rise to the change become known 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and overhead 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
provisions to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market are made based on a review of excess and obsolete inventories through an examination of historical component consumption  current market demands and shifting product technology 
significant assumptions with respect to market trends are utilized to formulate our provision methods 
sudden or downward changes in markets we serve may cause us to record additional inventory revaluation charges in future periods 
amortization of intangible assets customer relationships and non compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over seven and five years  respectively 
intangible assets are amortized on a basis that corresponds to the company s projections of future cash flows directly related to these intangible assets 
the estimates that are included in its projection of future cash flows are based on the best available information at the time of the determination of useful life and amortization method 
a change in circumstances could result in a determination that the related assets are impaired and impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including identifiable intangibles  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the associated discounted cash flows 
under sfas no 
 the company currently evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets trade names for impairment using a two step test based upon a fair value approach 
the first step is used to identify a potential impairment through an estimate of the fair value of certain reporting units as defined by sfas no 
 while the second step calculates the amount of impairment  if any 
additionally  goodwill shall be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using the method described in the preceding paragraph and determined the fair value of its reporting units by application of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the company makes estimates that are included in its discounted cash flow analyses based upon the best available information at the time of the fair value determination 
if circumstances change  the estimates of fair value will also change and could necessitate additional impairment charges that reduce the carrying value of goodwill 

table of contents contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies  including legal claims  in the normal course of business 
we accrue for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and can be estimated

the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material for the fiscal years ended june   and although the company may decide to enter into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against specific foreign currency receivables  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts in the fiscal years  or interest rate risk substantially all of our senior debt and the associated interest expense are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in incremental interest expense of approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively
