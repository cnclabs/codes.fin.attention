we caution you that our businesses and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties  including the factors identified in business risk factors  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are an online media company and value added information services provider in the people s republic of china the prc or china and the global chinese communities 
with a branded network of localized web sites targeting greater china and overseas chinese  we provide services through five major business lines including sina

in turn  we generate revenues through advertising  mvas and other fee based services 
the primary focus of our operations is in china  where we derive the majority of our revenues 
from to  our growth was mainly driven by our online advertising business  which generated the majority of our total revenues 
we began offering mvas under arrangements with third party mobile operators in the prc in late and have up until experienced significant growth in mvas revenues 
advertising and mvas are currently the major sources of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue in the near future periods 
our business operations in china are conducted primarily through material wholly owned subsidiaries  including bsit  star village 
com beijing internet technology  beijing new media information technology  beijing sina internet technology service  sina 
com technology china and fayco network technology development shenzhen  and vies  including the icp company  the gdicp company  xunlong  star vi  wangxing and the iad company 
we have completed a number of acquisitions over the past few years  including memestar in  crillion in and davidhill in our historical financial statements reflect the impact of these acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition 
excluding the impact from the acquisitions  our year over year comparison  calculated on a consolidated basis  would be significantly different 
we had incurred net losses through the third quarter of as of december  and  we had accumulated earnings of million and million  respectively 
we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily using the net proceeds raised through the sale of preference shares prior to our initial public offering and the sale of our ordinary shares in the initial public offering 
since we became profitable  we have also financed our operations using cash generated from operations 
we raised additional capital through the issuance of zero coupon  convertible  subordinated notes in july we will continue our investment in the development and enhancement of our products  content and services  as well as investment in sales and marketing 
if we are unable to generate sufficient net income from our operations in the future  we may have to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek equity or debt financing 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  financing operations  employee benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see the discussion in the section titled recent accounting pronouncements below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition advertising our advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising and sponsorship arrangements 
online advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of our web sites  in particular formats and over particular periods of time 
sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our web sites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we have certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable that may include placement on specific properties 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  and whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from purchase arrangements with our customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
mvas we mainly rely on third party mobile operators for billing and transmission of our mvas to our users 
the determination of whether we are the primary obligor for a particular type of service is subjective in nature and is based on an evaluation of the terms of the arrangement 
if the terms of the arrangement with mobile operators were to change and cause us to no longer be the primary obligor to the users  we would have to record our mvas revenues on a net basis 
consequently  this would cause a significant decline in our net revenues  but should not have a significant impact on our gross margin 
during fiscal  approximately of our mvas revenues were recorded on a gross basis 
due to the time lag between when the services are rendered and when the mobile operator billing statements are received  mvas revenues are estimated based on our internal records of billings and transmissions for the month  adjusting for prior periods confirmation rates with mobile operators and prior periods discrepancies between internally estimated revenues and actual revenues confirmed by mobile operators 
the confirmation rate applied to the estimation of revenue is determined at the lower of the latest confirmation rate available and the average of six months historical rates available  provided that we have obtained confirmation rates for six months 
if we have not yet received confirmation rates for six months  revenues would be deferred until billing statements are received from the mobile operators 
if subsequent billing statements from the mobile operators differ significantly from management s estimates  our revenues could be materially impacted 

table of contents in the past  one of our mobile operators has requested resettlement of billings that were settled in previous periods and on which payments have been received 
we have accrued for such credits to revenue based on a historical rolling average and the true ups between accrued amounts and actual credit memos issued have not been significant 
if mobile operators request for a resettlement of billings for previous periods at an amount significantly higher than historical average  our revenues could be severely impacted 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
advertising expenses we expense all advertising costs as incurred and classify these costs under sales and marketing expenses 
advertising expenses include costs related to direct advertising that are intended to acquire subscribers for monthly subscription based and usage based mvas 
assessing whether costs related to direct advertising should be expensed as incurred or capitalized and amortized over a longer period requires judgment  including determining whether the direct advertising activity has a primary purpose to elicit sales from customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and whether the activities would result in probable future economic benefits 
changes in assumptions could materially affect the manner in which direct advertising costs are expensed 
business combinations we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires that the acquisition cost to be allocated to the assets and liabilities we acquired based on their fair values 
we make estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities  based on independent appraisal reports for material purchases as well as our experience with similar assets and liabilities in similar industries 
if different judgments or assumptions were used  the amounts assigned to the individual acquired assets or liabilities could be materially different 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis  or more frequently  if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
we make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of operations in our current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
application of goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to the reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value of each reporting unit which could trigger impairment 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these reporting units could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
see note goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally from three to five years 
judgment is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets  especially for computer equipment  including determining how long existing equipment can function and when new technologies will be 
table of contents introduced at cost effective price points to replace existing equipment 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold or use is based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of  and have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r since january  we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures  over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
furthermore  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates  we may need to revise those estimates used in subsequent periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and espp shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based compensation awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance provided in sfas r and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimates of stock based compensation awards 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note for further information regarding stock based compensation under sfas r 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency our functional currency is the us dollar and our subsidiaries and vies in china  hong kong and taiwan use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
management must use judgment in determining an entity s functional currency  assessing economic factors including cash flow  sales price  sales market  expense  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
impact from exchange rate changes related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency is recorded as a gain and loss in our consolidated statements of operations  while impact from exchange rate changes related to translating a foreign entity s financial statements from the functional currency to our reporting currency  the us dollar  is disclosed and accumulated in a separate component under the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
different judgments or assumptions resulting in a change of functional currency may materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
for fiscal  our translation adjustment was million and our transactional loss was approximately million 
equity investments our equity investments are comprised of joint ventures and other privately held companies 
we account for equity investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
for equity investments over which we do not have significant influence  the cost method of accounting is used 
we evaluate our equity investments for impairment whenever events and changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the equity investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment evaluation requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the equity investments 
equity investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the equity investments 
the determination of fair value of the equity investments involves considering factors such as current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and undiscounted cash flows and other company specific information including recent financing rounds 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
fair value determination  particularly for equity investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the equity investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 

table of contents marketable securities our marketable securities are held as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
the treatment of a decline in the fair value of an individual security is based on whether the decline is other than temporary 
significant judgment is required to assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
our judgment of whether an impairment is other than temporary is based on an assessment of factors including our ability and intent to hold the individual security  severity of the impairment  expected duration of the impairment and forecasted recovery of fair value 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could affect our judgment of whether an identified impairment should be recorded as an unrealized loss in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets or as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the provisions of sab will be effective for us for the fiscal year ended december  we are currently evaluating the impact of applying sab but do not believe that the application of sab will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows nor results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas will be effective for us starting january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize and disclose in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin became effective on january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  if any  recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and its impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
in june  fasb ratified the provisions of eitf issue no 
how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf  which requires us to disclose how we account for taxes imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction 
eitf will be effective for us starting january  we do not believe that the application of eitf will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flow and results of operations 
results of operations net revenues years ended december  of change in thousands  except percentages yoy yoy net revenues advertising non advertising mvas others subtotal total net revenues 
table of contents total net revenues increased from to this was primarily due to the year over year increase in advertising revenues and was partially offset by the year over year decrease in mvas revenues as well as the year over year decline in other non advertising revenues  mainly from search 
advertising revenues as a percentage of total net revenues grew to in from in while mvas revenues declined to in from in total net revenues declined from to this was primarily due to the year over year decline in mvas revenues and was partially offset by the year over year increase in advertising revenues 
advertising 
advertising revenues grew year over year in and year over year in these increases were primarily due to the increase in the number of advertisers  price and overall average spending per advertiser in china 
for  advertising revenues from china accounted for of our total advertising revenues  compared to and of our total advertising revenues for and  respectively 
total number of advertisers in china was approximately in  compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
average revenue per advertising customer in china was approximately k in  as compared to approximately k and k in and  respectively 
our top ten customers in aggregate generated approximately  and of our advertising revenues in the prc in  and  respectively 
revenues from the automobile  information technology and real estate sectors contributed to approximately and of advertising revenues for and  respectively  and were responsible for the majority of our advertising revenue growth for these two years 
non advertising 
mvas revenues from china make up the majority of our non advertising revenues 
mvas revenues declined and year over year in and  respectively  which was the primary cause for the year over year declines in non advertising revenues in and mvas years ended december  of change in thousands  except percentages yoy yoy g products g products total mvas revenues revenues from g products  including sms  ivr  crbt  decreased and year over year in and  respectively 
sms is the largest component of our mvas 
revenues from sms were million  million and million or  and of total mvas revenues in  and  respectively 
the decline in sms revenues in from was largely due to higher churn rates by our monthly subscription users  less effective means to recruit new users and tightening operator policies and regulatory environment in china in general 
the decline was partially offset by the increase in ivr revenues which were million  million and million or  and of total mvas revenues in  and  respectively 
the year over year growth of ivr revenues in was primarily due to increased promotion and the addition of ivr service with china telecom 
revenues from crbt declined in as a result of reduced marketing efforts but previously increased in revenues from g products  including mms  wap and kjava  decreased year over year in while increasing year over year in mms declined and year over year in and  respectively  which was mainly due to certain changes by china mobile  including the switch to a new billing platform as well as policy changes on monthly subscription service 
wap revenues dropped year over year in  while kjava grew significantly in and but from a negligible base in 
table of contents in july  china mobile made significant changes to their policy on subscription based mvas 
these changes were in accordance with policy directives from china s ministry of information industry mii and were intended to address a number of issues  including reducing subscriber complaints  increasing customer satisfaction and promoting healthy development of the mvas industry in china 
the key changes include requiring double confirmations on new mvas subscriptions as well as sending sms reminders to existing monthly subscribers of sms  mms and wap to inform them of their mvas subscription and fee information 
certain provincial subsidiaries  such as guangdong mobile  one of china mobile s largest provincial subsidiaries  have begun to discontinue charging mvas users monthly subscription fees unless the users reply to the sms reminders and reconfirm their subscription 
other provincial subsidiaries are expected to announce similar measures of their own 
in addition  china mobile s provincial subsidiaries began canceling existing wap subscriptions that have been inactive for four months and existing sms subscriptions of users who have not successfully received more than three sms messages during the month 
in september  china unicom began enforcing double confirmations on new subscription services 
these policy changes by mobile operators have significantly reduced our ability to acquire new monthly mvas subscribers and increased the churn rate of our existing monthly mvas subscribers 
china mobile  china unicom and other operators may announce additional measures in response to the mii campaign in the future  which may adversely impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
for the fourth quarter of  of our revenues were from the mvas business  approximately and of which related to monthly subscription from china mobile and china unicom  respectively 
we derive the majority of our subscription revenues from sms  mms and wap  and we expect revenues from these products to continue to be negatively impacted in the near future 
we are in the process of developing and promoting new products that we believe are not subject to either china mobile s or china unicom s recent policy changes 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop any such new products  that any such products will achieve market acceptance or that such products will not be affected by future changes in rules and regulations 
other non advertising revenues other non advertising revenues include fee based services  such as virtual isp and paid email services  e commerce and other enterprise services such as paid search and directory listings 
the year over year decrease in other non advertising revenues in was mainly due to revenue declines from paid search and directory listings  loss of revenues from the sale of our online hotel booking business in the third quarter of and the sale of our interest in an online auction joint venture in the fourth quarter of revenues from paid search and directory listings accounted for  and of our other non advertising revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues from paid search and directory listings were mainly generated from pay by listing products related to an old search platform 
due to the phasing out of customer agreements  such revenues declined year over year in starting in the first quarter of  we began to promote our new search engine iask as the preferred search engine on our web site 
iask was offered free of charge during costs of revenues years ended december  of change of change yoy yoy in thousands  except percentages costs of revenues advertising non advertising mvas other subtotal total costs of revenues 
table of contents costs of revenues increased and year over year in and  respectively 
this was primarily due to the increase in costs of advertising revenue 
advertising 
costs of advertising revenue consist mainly of expenses associated with the production of our web sites  which include fees paid to third parties for internet connection  content and services  personnel related costs and equipment depreciation expenses associated with our web site production 
costs of advertising revenue also include the business taxes on advertising sales in the prc 
business taxes  surcharges and cultural business construction fees levied on advertising sales are approximately of the advertising revenues 
costs of advertising revenue increased and year over year in and  respectively 
the increases were due to higher web production costs driven by an increase in web production personnel and content fees  the increase in internet connection costs associated with the additional bandwidth as well as the increase in business taxes associated with higher advertising revenues 
these increases were driven by the need to provide additional resources to support our web traffic and advertising revenue growth 
in  costs of advertising revenue included stock based compensation of million as a result of the adoption of sfas r on january  in  content fees included million paid to an exclusive olympic content partner and million paid for other one time content purchases relating to olympic coverage 
non advertising 
costs of non advertising revenue consist mainly of fees paid to third party mobile operators for their services relating to the collection of our mvas revenues and for using their transmission gateways and fees or royalties paid to third party content providers for services and contents associated with our mvas 
costs of non advertising revenue also include business taxes and surcharges levied on non advertising sales in the prc 
business taxes and surcharges levied on non advertising revenues are approximately for mobile related revenues and for other non advertising revenues 
costs of mvas revenue increased slightly by year over year in while decreasing year over year in fees retained by or paid to mobile operators for  and were million  million and million  respectively  or  and  respectively  of our mvas revenues 
fees paid to third party content providers for  and were million  million and million  respectively  or  and  respectively  of our mvas revenues 
costs of other non advertising revenue also include costs for providing our enterprise services and other fee based services 
for  costs of other non advertising revenues include a million write off of prepaid royalty related to our igame based on management s assessment of the game business 
historical mvas cost trends may not be indicative of future results  as the mobile operators in china have made changes to the way service fees are charged 
for example  under a new arrangement with china mobile  we were required to switch from using our own platform for ivr services to china mobile s platform 
consequently  the service fees for ivr services were increased from to starting january revenues from ivr are mostly generated from direct advertising 
as a result of this change  we may incur higher costs of revenues or we may have to reduce  or discontinue  our promotion of ivr products  resulting in significant reduction of ivr revenues 
for  ivr revenues generated from china mobile were approximately million or of our mvas revenues 
china mobile  china unicom and other operators may choose to further change their fee policies  which may have a material and adverse impact to our results of operation  financial position and cash flow 
gross profit margins years ended december  gross profit margins advertising non advertising mvas other subtotal overall 
table of contents overall gross margin dropped four percentage points year over year to for and dropped two percentage points year over year for advertising 
the year over year decrease in advertising gross profit margin in was primarily due to the increased investment in our web site production and stock based compensation  which we began to expense starting january   pursuant to sfas r 
stock based compensation for accounted for approximately of our advertising revenues 
for  we paid million in revenue share expenses to an exclusive olympic content partner and incurred an additional million of other one time content purchases relating to the olympic coverage 
these one time content purchases were approximately of our advertising revenue for the year over year adjusted decline in advertising margin for was primarily due to the increase in our web site production expenses at a rate higher than the growth of advertising revenues 
we expect to continue to increase our investments in the production of web content and internet connection in absolute dollars to maintain our competitiveness 
non advertising 
the majority of the costs associated with non advertising revenues are variable costs 
gross margin for non advertising revenues decreased year over year in and year over year in these decreases were mainly driven by the increase in transmission and content costs without a proportionate increase in revenues from mvas 
we expect further increases in fees paid to mobile operators and content providers as a percentage of mvas revenues  which will result in continuing decline in mvas gross margin in the future

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  sales commissions  advertising and promotional expenditures and travel expenses

product development expenses 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses incurred for the enhancement to and maintenance of our web sites as well as costs associated with new product development and enhancement for products such as email  blog and search engine 
the year over year increases for and were primarily due to increases in headcount and higher depreciation expenses  resulting from additional purchases of capital equipment 
product development expenses in also included stock based compensation of million  as a result of adopting sfas r

the increases in effective income tax rate from in and in to in was primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from the allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals and other liabilities 
for further information on our tax structures and inherent risks see if tax benefits currently available to us in china were no longer available  our effective income tax rates for our china operations could increase to under risk factors in part i item a 
see also note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes 
we expect our effective tax rate for our operation in china to continue to increase in the future  as we experience further expiration of tax holidays 
liquidity and capital resources as of december in thousands cash and cash equivalents and short term investments working capital shareholder s equity we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily using the million raised through the sale of preference shares  the million raised from the sale of ordinary shares in the initial public offering and the million raised from the sale of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in july  as well as cash generated from operations 
on july   we sold million aggregate amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes the notes due in a private offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes were issued at par and bear no interest 
the notes are convertible into our ordinary shares  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments for certain events 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares  or a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after july   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
the purchasers may require us to repurchase all or part of the notes for cash on july annually from through  and on july   and upon a change of control  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
in accordance with sfas  obligations such as the notes are required to be classified as a current liability if they are or will be callable within one year from the balance sheet date 
the closing price of our ordinary shares on december   the last trading day of  was 
based on the circumstances and information provided to us as of december   we do not believe that it is likely the purchasers will require us to repurchase the notes in we filed a registration statement on form s for the 
table of contents resale of the notes and the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the notes  which registration statement is no longer effective 
one of the conditions for conversion of the notes to sina ordinary shares is that the sale price defined as closing per share sales price of sina ordinary shares reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time 
the specified thresholds are i during the period from issuance to july   if the sale price of sina ordinary shares  for each of any five consecutive trading days in the immediately preceding quarter  exceeds of the conversion price per ordinary share  and ii during the period from july  to july   if the sale price of sina ordinary shares on the previous trading day is more than of the conversion price per ordinary share 
for the quarter ended december   the sale price of sina ordinary shares did not exceed of the conversion price per ordinary share for five consecutive trading days 
the notes are therefore not convertible into sina ordinary shares for the quarter ending march  in accordance with threshold i described above 
upon a purchaser s election to convert the notes in the future periods  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares  or a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to meet the future requirements of our operating activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equities or obtain credit facilities to enhance our liquidity position or to increase our cash reserve for future acquisitions 
the sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

based on the current rental lease agreements  future minimum rental payments required as of december  are million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the majority of the commitments are from our office lease agreements in the prc 
purchase commitments mainly include minimum commitments for internet connection fees associated with web site production  content fees associated with web site production and mvas  advertising serving services and marketing activities 
there are uncertainties regarding the legal basis of our ability to operate an internet business and telecom value added services in china 
although the country has implemented a wide range of market oriented economic reforms  the telecommunication  information and media industries remain highly regulated 
not only are such restrictions currently in place  but in addition regulations are unclear as to in which specific segments of these industries companies with foreign investors  including us  may operate 
therefore  we might be required to limit the scope of our operations in china  and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
for a discussion of current lawsuits  please refer to item legal proceedings 
off balance sheet commitments and arrangements we have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated third parties 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity  or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity 
moreover  we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and security market risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash to government or quasi government securities  high quality corporate securities and bank guaranteed products 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
due to the fact that a majority of our investments are in short term instruments  we believe that the company has the ability to hold to maturity these investments 
as of december   we had unrealized losses of million related to our short term investments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
we have approximately million in cash and bank deposits  such as time deposits and bank notes  with five different banks in china  which constitute about of our total cash  cash equivalent and short term investments as of december  the terms or these deposits are  in general  up to twelve months 
historically  deposits in chinese banks are secure due to the state policy on protecting depositors interests 
however  china promulgated a new bankruptcy law in august  which will come into effect on june   which contains a separate article expressly stating that the state council may promulgate implementation measures for the bankruptcy of chinese banks based on the bankruptcy law 
under the new bankruptcy law  a chinese bank may go bankrupt 
in addition  since china s concession to wto  foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in china and have been severe competitors against chinese banks in many aspects  especially since the opening of renminbi business to foreign banks in late therefore  the risk of bankruptcy of those banks in which we have deposits has increased 
in the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks which holds our deposits  we are unlikely to claim our deposits back in full since we are unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on prc laws 

table of contents our million  zero coupon  convertible  subordinated notes due bear no interest and are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  there is no interest or foreign currency exchange risk associated with the outstanding notes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues derived and expenses and liabilities incurred are in chinese renminbi with a relatively small amount in new taiwan dollars  hong kong dollars and us dollars 
thus  our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the currencies of china  taiwan and hong kong 
see currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting our ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if renminbi were to decline in value  reducing our revenue in us dollar terms in the risk factors section 
we have not reduced our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
while we may choose to do so in the future  the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exchange rate risks 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
during the twelve months ended december   the foreign currency translation adjustments to our comprehensive income were million and the currency transaction loss was approximately million  primarily as a result of the chinese renminbi appreciating against the us dollar 
below is a sensitivity analysis on the impact of a change in the value of the chinese renminbi against the us dollar assuming projected net income from operation in china equal to fiscal  projected net assets of the operation in china equal to the balances in chinese renminbi and us dollar as of december  and currency fluctuation occurs proportionately over the period translation change in the value of adjustments to transaction gain chinese renminbi against the comprehensive income loss us dollar in thousands in thousands appreciate appreciate depreciate depreciate investment risk equity investment we have direct equity investment in a privately held company  which is considered in the start up or development stages 
this equity investment is inherently risky  as the technologies or products this company has under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our equity investment in this company 
as of december   our direct equity investment was million 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
investment in marketable debt securities we invest in marketable debt securities to preserve principal and maximize yield without significantly increasing risks 
as of december   our marketable debt securities totaled million 
these marketable debt securities are accounted for as available for sale and are reported at fair value  because our intent is to make them readily available for sale to meet operating or acquisition needs 
as of december   unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income of shareholders equity was million
