item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the risk factors appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in this discussion  unless the context suggests otherwise  references to the company  we  us and our mean kite realty group trust and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a full service  vertically integrated real estate company engaged in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  construction  expansion and development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and certain commercial real estate properties in selected growth markets in the united states 
we also provide real estate facility management  construction  development and other advisory services to third parties 
kite realty group trust commenced operations on august  prior to that date  the entities that owned the properties and service companies we acquired as part of our formation transactions were under the common control of al kite  john kite and paul kite the principals 
for the purpose of comparing our operating performance and cash flow results to the same periods of the prior year  we have combined the company s results for the period from august  through december  with the predecessor s results for the period from january  through august  we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
we also derive revenues from providing management  leasing  real estate development  construction and real estate advisory services through our taxable reit subsidiaries 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required payments and overall real estate market conditions 
we intend to continue to focus on pursuing targeted development and acquisitions of neighborhood and community shopping centers 
we expect to incur additional debt in connection with any future development or acquisitions of real estate 
as of december   we owned interests in a portfolio of operating retail properties totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space and entities in our development pipeline in which the company has an interest 
as of december   we also owned interests in four operating commercial properties totaling approximately  square feet of net rentable area and an associated parking garage 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we have a significant visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels are in the final stages of preparation for construction to commence 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of three projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in land parcels comprising approximately acres for which predevelopment activities are underway for the expansion or development of new retail 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the balance sheet in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
purchase price allocation the purchase price of operating properties is allocated to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

in making estimates of fair values for the purpose of allocating purchase price  a number of sources are utilized 
we also consider information about each property obtained as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets  including the fair value of the building on an as if vacant basis and to land determined by real estate tax assessments  independent appraisals  or other relevant data 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income  and the value of leases acquired 
we utilize independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements  leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease up period as if the space was vacant 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
we also consider whether a portion of the purchase price should be allocated to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
to date  a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to land acquisition and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
these pre development costs are included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the development of a property is no longer probable  any pre development costs previously incurred are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of the development property becomes operational  we expense appropriate costs on a pro rata basis 
impairment of investment properties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 investment properties are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for investment properties are recorded when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected hold period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
our properties generally have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
prior periods have been restated to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
results of operations acquisition and development activities the comparability of results of operations is significantly affected by our development and acquisition activities and the effects of the ipo and related formation transactions

these interests recognized a loss of million in prior to the date of our ipo and were consolidated from the date of their acquisition

in december  we sold mid america clinical labs and  accordingly  have reclassified prior periods to reflect the activity of this property as discontinued operations

the amount of operating income for this property in fiscal year was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
as of december   our borrowing base under the then existing secured revolving credit facility was approximately million  of which approximately million was available for additional borrowings 
as of december   there were properties available to be added to the borrowing base upon completion of the lender s due diligence process as additional funds were required for potential additional borrowing capacity in excess of million 
borrowings under this credit facility bore interest at a floating interest rate of libor plus to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
our ability to borrow under the secured credit facility was subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants  including with respect to our amount of leverage  minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios  our minimum tangible net worth  the collateral pool properties generating sufficient net operating income to maintain a certain fixed charge ratio and minimum aggregate occupancy rate 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the secured credit facility 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated four year million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders and key bank national association  as agent unsecured facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of february   with a one year extension option 
initial proceeds of million were drawn from this unsecured facility to repay the principal amount outstanding under our then existing secured revolving credit facility and retire the secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the new unsecured facility bear interest at a floating interest rate of libor plus to basis points  depending on our leverage 
the unsecured facility has a to commitment fee applicable to the average daily unused amount 
the amount that we may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of properties in the unencumbered property pool 
subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  we have the option to increase our borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line may not be outstanding for more than five days 
our ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants  including with respect to our amount of leverage  minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios  our minimum tangible net worth  the collateral pool properties generating sufficient net operating income to maintain a certain fixed charge ratio and a minimum aggregate occupancy rate 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are permitted to make distributions to our shareholders of up to of our funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  we may only make distributions sufficient to maintain our reit status 
however  we may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment of bankruptcy exists  or if our obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  general economic downturns or downturns in the markets in which we own properties may still adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their lease obligations 
in that event  our cash flow from operations could be materially affected 
the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements for qualifying for reit status which includes the stipulation that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income and to avoid paying tax on our income  necessitate that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties and million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
approximately million of our tenant improvements and external leasing commissions was related to replacement tenants for ultimate electronics at two of our properties 
in  winn dixie filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection to reorganize its business operations 
in the second quarter of  winn dixie vacated the space at shops at eagle creek and we acquired its lease with us in a bankruptcy auction at a cost of million  excluding common area maintenance and tax obligations of million that were adjusted from the payment 
winn dixie continues to occupy the space at waterford lakes and has paid rent through march we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  acquisitions of properties and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
as of december   we had development projects underway 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these properties is approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of december  our share of the total estimated cost is approximately million  of which we have incurred approximately million as of december  in addition to our current development pipeline  we have a significant visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in the final stages of preparation for construction to commence 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of three projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet at a total estimated project cost of approximately million  of which our share is million 
however  upon the commencement of construction of the parkside town commons property  our interest will be reduced from to and our total share of the visible shadow pipeline estimated project cost will be reduced to approximately million 
we are actively pursuing the acquisition and development of other properties  which will require additional capital 
we do not expect to have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term cash requirements 
we will have to satisfy these needs through participation in joint venture transactions  additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares and or cash generated through property dispositions 
we believe we will have access to these sources of capital to fund our long term liquidity requirements but we cannot assure this will be the case 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions 
in september  we announced an agreement the venture with prudential real estate investors prei to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
the venture provides us the ability to develop or acquire up to billion of well positioned community shopping centers in strategic markets in the united states 
it is expected that equity capital contributions of up to million will be made to the venture for qualifying projects 
we expect contributions would be made on a project by project basis with prei contributing and us contributing the remaining of the equity required 
we anticipate equity contributions will be required near the time of development stabilization or at the time a property acquisition is identified in the future 
we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in october  we issued million common shares under this registration statement for gross offering proceeds of approximately million 
we are currently pursuing the redevelopment of our glendale mall property in indianapolis  indiana 
as of december   glendale mall was our largest property on a square footage basis with an annualized base rent of approximately million  representing approximately of our total annualized base rent 
we anticipate that our redevelopment will include demolishing the enclosed mall between the two anchor buildings  selling a portion of the property to a new anchor tenant  and constructing new small shop buildings on the property 
approximately leases were terminated with tenants of the portions of the mall to be demolished 
we anticipate that tenant buyouts and relocation costs will be approximately million 
macy s  kerasotes theatres  staples  and the indianapolis marion county public library will continue operating and paying rent during the redevelopment 
based on current redevelopment plans  we expect our net investment to be approximately million  after any proceeds from tax increment financing and other sources

funds from operations funds from operations ffo  is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definitions differently than we do 
our calculation of ffo and reconciliation to net income is as follows company predecessor combined year ended december  year ended december  august  through december  january  through august  january  through december  funds from operations net income loss add loss on sale of asset  net of tax less gain on sale of operating property add limited partners interests in income add depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities and discontinued operations  net of minority interest add depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities deduct minority interest add joint venture partners interests in net income of unconsolidated entities add joint venture partners interests in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities funds from operations of the kite portfolio add minority interest less minority interest share of depreciation and amortization less joint venture partners interests in net income of unconsolidated entities less joint venture partners interests in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities less limited partners interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company basic weighted average common shares outstanding diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average common shares and units outstanding diluted weighted average common shares and units outstanding amounts represent the minority and joint venture partners interests acquired in connection with the company s initial public offering and related formation transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates of debt instruments of similar maturities and terms 
market risk related to fixed rate debt we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of december  inclusive of net premiums on acquired debt of million 
during  we entered into interest rate swaps totaling million to hedge variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt 
during  one swap with a value of million matured 
the company s remaining two cash flow hedges expire on august  including the effects of these swaps  our fixed and variable rate debt would have been approximately million and million  respectively  of our total consolidated indebtedness at december  reflecting our share of unconsolidated debt  our fixed and variable rate debt is and  respectively  of total consolidated and our share of unconsolidated indebtedness at december  based on the amount of our fixed rate debt  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in its fair value of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would increase or decrease our annual cash flow by approximately million 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
this helps reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
