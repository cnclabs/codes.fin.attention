the results of this study could lead to the initiation of a clinical trial for the treatment of hiv infected patients  with approval from the fda  or to an offshore human study in collaboration with a partner

off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission  or sec  has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies because they are impacted significantly by estimates we make 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
stock based compensation the company accounts for all stock options in accordance with the provisions of fas r  which requires that we recognize compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions in our financial statements 
the company accounts for stock based awards to non employees in accordance with fas r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions to use in the computation of the amounts to be recorded pursuant to the provisions of fas r 
we estimate the fair value of each option granted to an employee on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected life  estimated forfeitures  expected volatility and dividend yield of the option 
management bases its assumptions on historical data where available 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and therefore are subject to management s judgment 
income taxes the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
