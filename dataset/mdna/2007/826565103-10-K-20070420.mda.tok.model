many of our chipset products are designed to be used in a wide range of applications within these appliances 
iptv set top boxes video delivered and distributed over internet protocol ip is emerging as an important product category for a growing number of consumer equipment makers 
we believe broadband internet connectivity  highly compressed digital media  and a fundamental demand for entertainment alternatives are paving the way for iptv delivered over dsl 
new set top boxes  many based on advanced codecs such as h 
or wmv and advanced digital rights management drm  are being developed by telecommunications companies around the world to tap into the potential revenues streams that may be created by these products 
many international regions currently lack the cable infrastructure that exists in the us  thus creating demand for reliable high quality video delivery 
we attempt to meet this demand by offering a chip with a set of features including high performance silicon and streaming video software 
iptv services are currently being deployed by two platforms  the linux platform and the microsoft tv platform 
the new microsoft tv platforms being shipped by at t  deutsche telecom  british telecom  and other major carriers are currently being designed around our smp media processor chips 
similarly  the majority of our design wins in the linux platform camp are based on the smp and include such carriers as freebox  hanaro  china telecom  and others 
connected media players connected media players are a range of devices such as high definition dvd players blu ray  hd dvd  and others  digital media adapters dmas  portable media devices  and multi function media centers 
high definition dvd players are just now starting to emerge for the mainstream  being carried by the two new standards blu ray and hd dvd 
high definition dvd players with advanced video codecs have been a niche product of choice for entertainment enthusiasts for many years 
we introduced the first dvd decoder chips supporting playback of mpeg and divx video  and have followed up with the support for wmv  an important new feature for downloading content 
we are a supplier in this segment and provide chips with the latest codecs h 
and vc  support for networking and local hard drives  and high definition video output 
though our chips can be used for either major standard  at this time  we are heavily embedded in the blu ray camp  with six players being designed around our smp as we move forward  we expect volume to increase for high definition player products  which in turn will increase the revenues for our product line 
digital media adapters are a new consumer product category which support distribution of video audio content to television sets throughout the home using wired or wireless connectivity 
dmas typically work in 
table of contents conjunction with a centralized media center or gateway to offer ubiquitous digital media in home 
we provide chipset solutions for dmas  utilizing similar features developed for other media players and iptv set top boxes 
companies such as d link  netgear  sharp  i o data and lg electronics are providing connected media player for the consumer market using our silicon solutions 
we also sell our chipsets for use in portable media devices 
with ongoing technology improvements in media compression  wireless communications  and small form factor storage  portable media players have quickly become the media on the go equivalent of the cell phone 
the trend toward hand held players has already moved to the mainstream for audio  while new advanced video compression schemes are enabling the addition of movies  personal video and photos  for use on the road and within the home 
we serve this market by selling media processors that offer the latest codecs in a highly integrated package along with low power consumption 
high definition television hdtv sets represent a substantial and growing product category  currently selling in the millions of units  led by the us market and moving overseas 
new widescreen hdtv sets are being offered in an increasing array of forms using three primary technologies  which are liquid crystal display lcd  plasma and projection  each providing its own set of advantages 
we offer a growing line of high definition media processors designed for flat panel displays and offer advanced display processing features 
our em series of digital media processor has been selected for use in high definition plasma television sets from such customers as lg electronics 
pc add in and other markets the pc add in and other markets consists of pc add in board and chipset products  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets and other accessories 
this is largely a legacy area for sigma and not a focal market for penetration 
industry alliances to meet customer needs for a complete system solution  we have developed strong relationships with leading suppliers of chipsets  system software and video servers encoders 
companies that provide live encoders and server systems enable original equipment manufacturers to deliver complete solutions for ip video streaming applications 
our set top appliance reference designs  in some cases  depend on vendors of processors  graphics controllers  video encoders  wireless controllers  and dtv tuners 
furthermore  stand alone consumer appliances require a substantial amount of software and middleware  from vendors such as alcatel  siemens myrio  nds  syabas  or microsoft  with which we also have strong working relationships 
sigma business strategy our objective is to provide digital media processing chipsets that offer advanced features  high video quality  and rapid time to market for our target applications 
we continue to invest in technology development as well as utilize our fundamental advantages 
we believe that our field proven  decoder technology  now in our fourth generation of silicon and equivalent evolution of software  represents one of our competitive advantages 
we continue to invest and build on six primary technology foundations to provide the highest quality digital video audio solutions possible digital video decoding including mpeg  and h  vc  and wmv  digital audio decoding including mpeg  and proprietary formats  including dolby digital and windows media audio wma  
table of contents advanced scene composition including advanced video scaling  adaptive deinterlacing  adaptive flicker filtering and prioritized alpha mixing  secure media processing for effectively protecting content and processing drm algorithms  transport handling and conditional access  software clients for vod and ip multicast and navigation software for dvd video  dvd audio  svcd  vcd  cd and hdd playback  and standard definition sd and high definition hd solutions that share a common hardware and software architecture 
recent acquisition on february   we acquired blue communications blue  which was a privately held california corporation 
our subsidiary  blue  will focus on the development of advanced wireless technologies and ultra wideband uwb semiconductor products 
we believe demand for wireless communication solutions continues to increase and escalate  and encompasses an increasing portion of the consumer electronics environment 
while wifi solutions have largely satisfied the need for medium bandwidth data communications  it has failed to address the needs of an audio video entertainment network which requires  enough bandwidth to handle multiple high definition video streams while remaining within the price range of mainstream adoption 
ultra wideband uwb technology may offer such a solution  supporting a maximum data rate of mbps with high quality of service qos  low power consumption and competitive pricing 
we believe that our focus on ip video and networked consumer products  the addition of wireless communication products and technologies from blue will enable us to address broader solutions and increase our value add in each product 
sigma products we offer chip level products that enable digital media processing solutions for consumer appliances 
we believe our line of digital media processing chips features high video quality 
we complement our silicon technology with embedded software  portable to a wide range of operating environments 
featuring vod and media navigation clients  our software is available under windows  linux and wince operating systems 
in addition  we develop and sell reference platforms designed around our silicon and software as application examples for customer development 
the following chipset products are sold primarily into the consumer appliance market the em series provides mpeg  and video and audio decoding for broadband interactive set top boxes  including companies such as fujitsu siemens  acer and samsung 
the em series represents one of the first mpeg silicon solutions for the set top box market 
the em series is the first solution for dvd players  portable media players and video endpoints to support mpeg and divx 
it is also the first to feature high quality scaling to hdtv resolutions and support for dvi hdcp 
the unique features of the em series enabled the availability of networked dvd players and low cost video endpoints  such as digital media adaptors and broadband network devices 
the em series represents the first hdtv decoder silicon solutions to also support mpeg and ip video streaming 
designed for hdtvs and advanced set top boxes  it also offers advanced audio and video processing and progressive dvd playback 
the software compatible eml series addresses the more cost sensitive sdtv and video endpoint markets 
the eml series represents the first hd wmv decoder silicon solution and also supports dvd and hd mpeg decoding 
designed for a wide range of applications  this is the primary media processor sold into digital media adaptors and hdtv televisions 

table of contents the smp series is one of the first chips to offer integrated support for h  wmv  and mpeg decoding in a single system on chip solution 
it is designed for iptv set top boxes  high definition dvd players  and other consumer products 
as legacy products  we also offer a series of pc based solutions  under the netstream and realmagic xcard brand names  that are sold into the commercial streaming and pc add in market respectively the netstream and tv are pc add in cards featuring high performance mpeg and decoding  bringing streaming video to most pc based systems 
the realmagic xcard is a desktop pc add in solution that plugs into a standard pci slot  providing high quality dvd  mpeg and divx video playback onto a standard tv or hdtv 
major customers major customers that accounted for over of our total net revenues are as follows customers regions fiscal fiscal fiscal freebox sa europe uniquest asia cisco kiss technology north america europe less than cisco  a north american company  acquired our customer kiss technologies  formally a european company  in fiscal marketing and sales we currently sell most of our products through our direct sales force 
we augment these sales through a select set of distributors and manufacturer representatives operating in different regions of the world 
our original equipment manufacturers  or oems  have included motorola  cisco sa linksys  lg electronics  samsung  sony  sharp  pioneer  panasonic  and many others 
our international distributors are strategically located in many countries around the world 
we generally maintain products for distribution through corporate markets based on forecasts rather than firm purchase orders 
for our larger volume oems  purchase orders for delivery dates within weeks are generally non cancelable and non reschedulable  greater than weeks are generally reschedulable  and greater than weeks are generally cancelable 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor products from our suppliers on an eight to twelve week lead time basis 
consequently  if  as a result of inaccurate forecasts or canceled purchase orders  anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  requiring more working capital and resulting in more pressure on our operating results 
international customers accounted for  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from our customers in asia accounted for  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to distributors are typically subject to contractual rights of inventory rotation and price protection 
regardless of particular contractual rights  the failure of one or more distributors or oems to achieve sustained sell through products could result in product returns or delayed or uncollectable receivables  contributing to significant fluctuations in our operating results 

table of contents research and development as of february   we had a staff of research and development personnel 
these research and development personnel conduct all of our product development with the assistance of a number of independent contractors and consultants 
we focus our development efforts primarily on three aspects decoder technologies  including all forms of mpeg  h  vc  and a wide range of audio codecs  secure media processing  including drm  conditional access  and secure data path  and fully integrated system on chip soc solutions 
to achieve and maintain technological leadership  we must continue to make technological advancements in the areas of video and audio compression and decompression 
these advancements include maintaining compatibility with emerging standards and multiple platforms  and making improvements to the current architecture 
during fiscal   and  our research and development expenses were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we plan to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development of future generations of mpeg and other multimedia products 
competition the market for digital media processors is highly competitive 
strategic competitors are broadcom and st microelectronics 
additional rival companies include analog devices  amd ati technologies  conexant systems  genesis microchip  lsi logic  mediatek  nxp semiconductors  pixelworks  texas instruments and zoran corporation 
many of these companies have higher profiles  larger financial resources  and greater marketing resources than we do and may develop a competitive product that may inhibit the wide acceptance of our products technology 
we believe that other manufacturers are developing mpeg products that will compete directly with our products in the near future 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for digital media processors include time to market for new product introductions  product performance  industry standards compatibility  price  and marketing and distribution resources 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to time to market  product performance and industry standards compatibility  and we may not be able to compete favorably with respect to price and marketing and distribution resources 
licenses  patents and trademarks we continually seek patent protection for certain software and hardware features and intend to do so for future versions 
we currently have seven pending patent applications for our technology 
thirty patents have been issued to us 
the termination dates of these patents range from to years 
we cannot assure you that more patents will be issued or that such patents  even if issued  or our existing patents will provide adequate protection for our competitive position 
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers  suppliers and employees and other security measures 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  we cannot assure you that these measures will be successful 
manufacturing to reduce overhead expenses  along with capital and staffing requirements  we currently use third party contract manufacturers to fulfill all of our manufacturing needs  including chipset manufacturing and board level assembly 
all of the chips used by us to develop our decoding products are manufactured by outside suppliers and foundries 
each of these suppliers is our sole source of supply for the respective chips produced by such supplier and we do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments 
our reliance on independent suppliers involves several risks  including the potential absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
any delay or interruption 
table of contents in the supply of any of the components required for the production of products could seriously harm our sales of products and  thus  our operating results 
backlog historically  our backlog has not been reflective of future sales  because of the short period of time between customer order and delivery of product 
however  this has changed substantially over the past months as we have engaged with larger oem customers with higher volumes and more forecastable demand 
as a result  the majority of our quarterly shipments are now based on longer range forecasts which are turned into firm purchase orders typically at weeks from shipment 
employees as of february   we had full time employees worldwide  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in operations  and in finance and administration 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing  engineering and management personnel  who are in great demand 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

risk factors if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly 
the matters related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements may result in additional litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
for more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries  please see part i  item legal proceedings as well as the other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this section 
we have provided the results of our internal review and investigation of our stock option practices to the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and in that regard we have responded to informal requests for documents and additional information 
we intend to continue to cooperate with the sec and any other governmental agency which may become involved in this matter 
we cannot give any assurance regarding the outcomes from litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock option practices 
the resolution of these matters will be time consuming  expensive  and may distract management from the conduct of our business 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and reported  or not reported  the corresponding financial impact 
accordingly  there is a risk that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or take other actions not currently contemplated 
also  in september  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended july  the second quarter form q  we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule c and were therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
in december  we received an additional letter from nasdaq of similar substance related to our form q for the quarter ended october  the third quarter form q 
in january  the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted our request for continued listing  provided that we file a response with nasdaq to specific requests for information from nasdaq related to our stock option granting practices review as well as the second quarter form q  the third quarter form q and any required restatements with the sec on or before march  in february  we received a notice from the nasdaq listing and hearings review council  which advised us that any delisting determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel has been stayed pending further review by the review council 
we have been given until may  to submit additional information to assist the review council in their assessment of our listing status 
on february   we filed with nasdaq a response to specific requests for information from nasdaq related to our stock option granting practices review 
in addition  immediately before the filing of this form k  we filed the second quarter form q and the third quarter form q with the sec 
we consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c  subject to nasdaq s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly 
however  if nasdaq disagrees with our position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected  which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we have had ongoing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting since the fiscal period ended january   the first year in which we were required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of in september  we announced that our historical financial statements should no longer be relied upon as a result of our preliminary determination of an internal review relating to our practices in administering stock option grants 
as a result  we have been unable to report in a timely manner our financial results for the past three quarterly periods as a result of a voluntary review of our stock option grant practices 
for the period ended february   we concluded that we had material weaknesses which resulted in ineffective internal controls over financial reporting  as further described in item a  report of management on internal control over financial reporting 
our independent registered public accounting firm reached the same conclusion 
effective controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
we have initiated corrective actions  which we believe will help remediate each of these material weaknesses 
however  we cannot be certain that these measures will result in our ability to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
if these actions are not successful in addressing these material weaknesses or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we cannot establish effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and any of these factors could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing models and product sales mix  unexpected reductions in unit sales  average selling prices and gross margins  particularly if they occur precipitously  expenses related to our remediation efforts and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  expenses related to implementing and maintaining a new enterprise resource management system and other information technologies  the level of acceptance of our products by our oem customers  and acceptance of our oem customers products by their end user customers  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products and those of our competitors  the loss of one or more significant customers  the timing of  and potential unexpected delays in  our customer orders and product shipments  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  
table of contents an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials included in our products  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacturing of products  which could cause shipping delays  availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain products  the impact of potential economic instability in the asia pacific region  and continuing impact and expenses related to our stock option review and its resolution 
our business is highly dependent on the expansion of young and rapidly evolving segments of the consumer electronics market 
our business is highly dependent on developing segments of the consumer electronics market  which market segments include ip video set top boxes  connected media players  and high definition televisions 
we expect the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future to come from the sale of chipsets for use in emerging consumer applications 
our ability to sustain and increase revenues is in large part dependent on the continued growth of these young and rapidly evolving market segments  whose future is largely uncertain 
many factors could impede or interfere with the expansion of these consumer market segments  including consumer demand in these segments  general economic conditions  other competing consumer electronic products  delays in the deployment of telecommunications video services and insufficient interest in new technology innovations 
in addition  even if these consumer market segments expand  manufacturers of products in these segments may not choose to utilize our products in their products  but rather the products of our competitors 
moreover  market acceptance of the products of manufacturers that do utilize our products may not occur as expected 
in any such case  our business would likely be harmed 
the average selling prices of our products have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross margins 
our markets are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of customers to design our chips into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
in the past  we have had to reduce our prices significantly to meet customer requirements 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets for our products mature  new technologies emerge  and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we depend on a limited number of significant customers  and any reduction  delay or cancellation of an order from these significant customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenues to decline 
in fiscal  freebox sa accounted for of our revenues and uniquest accounted for of our revenues 
our dependence on a few major customers will likely continue 
the reduction  delay or cancellations of orders from major customers or the loss of a major customer could cause our revenues to decline and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collection from key customers could harm our business 
our sales to oem customers involve a number of risks  including price pressures  which could harm our revenues and cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our ability to increase sales and achieve continued profitability depends substantially on our ability to maintain a high level of sales to our oem customers 
our oem customers are not under any obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of our products 
also  even if we achieve new design wins with oem customers  these manufacturers may not purchase our products in substantial volumes to recoup our development costs 
sales to any particular oem customer fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are subject to severe 
table of contents price pressures as a result of our competitors 
any reduction in sales to oem customers could seriously harm our business 
we expect that our sales to oem customers will continue to experience significant fluctuations  which will cause our operating results to fluctuate as well 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
if we fail to compete effectively  our market share and revenues could decline 
the markets in which we operate are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  continuously evolving customer requirements and declining average selling prices 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  our market share and revenues could decline 
we compete with large semiconductor manufacturers and designers 
most of our competitors have substantial experience and expertise in audio  video and multimedia technology and in producing and selling consumer products through retail distribution and oem channels 
these companies also have substantially greater engineering  marketing and financial resources than we have 
our competitors could form cooperative relationships that could present formidable competition to us 
we cannot assure you that our technology will continue to achieve commercial success or that it will compete effectively against other interactive multimedia products  services and technologies that currently exist  are under development  or may be announced by competitors 
we have a history of operating losses and we could sustain future losses 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable and if we lose money  our business may not be financially viable 
we have incurred significant operating losses in certain past fiscal periods  including in fiscal year in recent years  we made significant investments in our development efforts 
we may not recognize the benefits of these investments 
we were profitable for the fiscal year however  we may not continue to be profitable 
we may incur operating losses in future quarterly periods or fiscal years  which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs  such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products  which would significantly harm our business and financial results 
even if we are able to anticipate  develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements  our new products or enhancements may not achieve widespread market acceptance 
any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we are a party to lawsuits  which are costly to investigate and defend and  if determined adversely to us  could require us to pay damages  any or all of which could harm our business and financial condition 
we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits 
for example  the sec has inquired regarding our stock option pricing practices  and we have been served with lawsuits related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other related matters  a description of which can be found below in part i  item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor 
regardless of whether they are resolved in our favor  these lawsuits are  and any future lawsuits to which we may 
table of contents become a party will likely be  expensive and time consuming to investigate  defend and or resolve 
such costs of investigation and defense  as well as any losses resulting from these claims  could significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process 
we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future 
if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
our ability to develop  market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and accounting  and support personnel 
the supply of highly qualified individuals  in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas  or sales people specializing in the semiconductor industry  is limited and competition for such individuals is intense 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales people  and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees  could delay the development and introduction of new products  and negatively impact our ability to market  sell or support our products 
if we fail to achieve initial design wins for our products  we may lose the opportunity for sales for a significant period of time to customers and be unable to recoup our investments in our products 
we expend considerable resources in order to achieve design wins for our products  especially our new products and product enhancements 
once a customer designs a semiconductor into a product  it is likely to continue to use the same semiconductor or enhanced versions of that semiconductor from the same supplier across a number of similar and successor products for a lengthy period of time due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier and potentially redesigning the product to incorporate a different semiconductor 
if we fail to achieve an initial design win in a customer s qualification process  we may lose the opportunity for significant sales to that customer for a number of its products and for a lengthy period of time 
this may cause us to be unable to recoup our investments in our products  which would harm our business 
our sales cycle can be lengthy  which could result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenue 
because our products are based on constantly evolving technologies  we have experienced a lengthy sales cycle for some of our chipsets  particularly those designed for set top box applications for the iptv market 
our sales cycle typically ranges from nine to twelve months 
we may experience a delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing efforts and inventory and the time we generate revenue  if any  from these expenditures 
in addition  because we do not have long term commitments from our customers  we must repeat our sales process on a continual basis even for current customers looking to purchase a new product 
as a result  our business could be harmed if a customer reduces or delays its orders  chooses not to release products incorporating our semiconductors or elects not to purchase a new product or product enhancements from us 

table of contents the timing of our customer orders and product shipments can adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenues during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the last months of that quarter 
this trend is likely to continue  and any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would adversely affect our operating results 
further  to the extent we receive orders late in any given quarter  we may be unable to ship products to fill those orders during the same quarter in which we received the corresponding order  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results for that quarter 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 
with the current demand for electronic products  component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited 
growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components may increase  or the components may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed 
we currently purchase finished wafers from a single source 
the development of alternate sources for finished wafers could take at least several quarters and the qualification process could be difficult and costly 
in addition  the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules 
in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers  we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner 
if  as a result  we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver product to our customers  which would seriously impact present and future sales  which would  in turn  adversely affect our business 
in addition  the development  licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management 
failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 
in the past  we have experienced production delays and other difficulties  and we could experience similar problems in the future 
our products might also contain defects that escape identification at the factory 
this could result in unanticipated costs  cancellations  deferrals of purchase orders  or costly recall of products from customer sites 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts  and changes to those relationships  expected or unexpected  may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we depend primarily on independent contract manufacturers  each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies  to manufacture our products 
although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers  those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price 
in addition  it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships 
therefore  if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays  disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations  or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed 
also  the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management 
moreover  a substantial portion of our manufacturing is performed in asian countries and is 
table of contents therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in these countries 
each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we are required to expense equity compensation given to our employees  which has reduced our reported earnings  will significantly harm our operating results in future periods and may reduce our stock price and our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 
we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our shareholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
we adopted this standard effective january  by causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs  such accounting changes have reduced  and will continue to reduce  our reported earnings  will significantly harm our operating results in future periods  and may require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees  which may make it more difficult for us to attract  retain and motivate key personnel 
moreover  if securities analysts  institutional investors and other investors adopt financial models that include stock option expense in their primary analysis of our financial results  our stock price could decline as a result of reliance on these models with higher expense calculations 
each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our international operations  and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future 
as a result of our international operations  we are affected by economic  regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries  including the imposition of government controls  changes or limitations in trade protection laws  unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws  natural disasters  labor unrest  earnings expatriation restrictions  misappropriation of intellectual property  acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors  which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations 
in particular  in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations  which could increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in international markets 
overseas sales and purchases to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risks 
moreover  local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us 
our employees  contractors and agents may take actions in violation of these internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us 
violations of laws or key control policies by our employees  contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems  fines  penalties  or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
due to the global nature of our operations  economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly to our oem customers and indirectly through our distributors in countries throughout the world and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are primarily located outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  political or social unrest  natural disasters  epidemic disease  war  or economic instability in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our 
table of contents ability to import or export our products from various countries  service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue  costs  expenses  results of operations and financial condition 
we may engage in investments in and acquisitions of other businesses and technologies  which could divert management s attention and prove difficult to integrate with our existing business and technology 
we continue to consider investments in and acquisitions of other businesses  technologies or products  to improve our market position  broaden our technological capabilities and expand our product offerings 
for example  we completed the acquisition of blue communications in february however  we may not be able to acquire  or successfully identify  the companies  products or technologies that would enhance our business 
once we identify a strategic opportunity  the process to consummate a transaction could divert management s attention from the operation of our business causing our financial results to decline 
if we are able to acquire companies  products or technologies  we could experience difficulties in integrating them 
integrating acquired businesses involves a number of risks  including but not limited to potential disruption of our ongoing business  unexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities  diversion of management resources from other business concerns  inability to retain employees of the acquired businesses  difficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies  adverse effects associated with entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience  and acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements  or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire  our operating results could be harmed 
changes in our tax rates will affect our future results 
our future effective tax rates will be favorably or unfavorably affected by the absolute amount and future geographic distribution of our pre tax income  our ability to take advantage of the available tax planning strategies and our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
for example  at february   we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our income taxes otherwise payable 
our use of the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards is limited by the annual limitations as described in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
our plans for continued international expansion may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards as our net income increases 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the outcomes of these examinations  if they occur  could harm our net income and financial condition 
our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
the timing and amount of 
table of contents our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements  the existence of opportunities for expansion  and access to and availability of sufficient management  technical  marketing and financial personnel 
if our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
financial accounting standards in the united states are constantly under review and may be changed from time to time 
we are required to apply these changes when adopted 
once implemented  these changes could result in material fluctuations in our financial results of operations and the way in which such results of operations are reported 
similarly  we are subject to taxation in the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions 
rates of taxation  definitions of income  exclusions from income  and other tax policies are subject to change over time 
changes in tax laws in a jurisdiction in which we have reporting obligations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
our business is subject to seasonality  which is likely to cause our revenues to fluctuate 
our business is subject to seasonality as a result of our target markets 
we sell a significant number of our semiconductors into the consumer market 
our customers who manufacture products for the consumer market experience seasonality in the sales of their products  which in turn may affect the timing and volume of orders for our semiconductors 
because the consumer market into which we sell our products is characterized by this seasonality  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards and  from time to time  has experienced significant downturns 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors have caused and could cause substantial fluctuations in our net revenue and in our operating results 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of this industry to fully recover from downturns could harm our business 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
accordingly  our operating results have varied and may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we rely upon patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  it could harm our ability to compete and to generate revenues 
our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we currently hold thirty patents and these patents will expire within the next to years 
these patents cover the technology 
table of contents underlying our products 
we have filed certain patent applications and are in the process of preparing others 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents for which we have applied will be issued or that any issued patents will provide meaningful protection of our product innovations 
like other multimedia companies  we rely primarily on trade secrets and technological know how in the conduct of our business 
we also rely  in part  on copyright law to protect our proprietary rights with respect to our realmagic technology 
we use measures such as confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
these methods of protecting our intellectual property may not be sufficient 
we may face intellectual property claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
the semiconductor and electronics industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation  and we may not be successful in such development or in obtaining such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  patent disputes in the electronics industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we do not yet have a large portfolio of issued patents  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
our stock price has demonstrated volatility and overall declines  and continued volatility in the stock market may cause further fluctuations or decline in our stock price 
the market for our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  which is expected to continue 
for example  during fiscal  the closing sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market ranged from a low of on july  to a high of on december  in addition  the stock market  in general  has experienced  and is currently experiencing  volatility that particularly affects the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies  such as those in the electronics and semiconductor industries 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
if we fail to comply with or obtain waivers for covenants under our loan obligations  our financial condition could be harmed 
we have two lines of credit with united commercial bank  expiring in august  which allow for borrowings of up to an aggregate of million 
as of february   we had no outstanding indebtedness under these loans 
during august  we also entered into a month term loan for million  which was used to purchase equipment for research and development 
as of february   we had  of outstanding indebtedness under this loan 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the lines of credit and the term loan 
we have on occasion  including as of february   been in violation of some of the covenants and in all cases  we have obtained waivers releasing us from our obligations to meet those covenants as of previous dates 
it is possible that we may need such a waiver for future non compliance and we cannot assure you that our bank will grant these waivers 
if we do not meet these covenants and cannot obtain waivers  the lender could accelerate payments of any amounts due under the lines of credit and the term loan 
to the extent we had borrowed amounts under these lines of credit and term loan and were required to repay them on an accelerated basis  it could substantially weaken our financial condition 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to make full payment on the lines of credit and the term loan when required  the bank could foreclose on our accounts receivable  inventories  general intangibles such as patents and trademarks  equipment and tangible assets that collateralize the notes  which would harm our business

item properties we currently lease an approximately  square foot facility in milpitas  california that is used as our headquarters 
the lease on our milpitas  california facility will expire in september in february  we have entered into a new lease agreement for a new approximately  square foot facility in milpitas  california in which we intend to relocate our headquarters sometime before the expiration of our current lease 
the new lease will commence on june  and expire in september we also lease facilities for a sales office and warehouse in hong kong  and a research and development office near paris  france 
we believe our existing facilities  including the anticipated headquarters facility  are both suitable and adequate for our near term needs 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we expect that the number and significance of these matters will increase as our business expands 
in particular  we could face an increasing number of patent and other intellectual property claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows 
any claims or proceedings against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which  if required  may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur against us  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices certain current and former directors and officers of the company have been named as defendants in several shareholder derivative actions filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  which have been consolidated under the caption in re sigma designs  inc derivative litigation the federal action and in a substantially similar shareholder derivative action filed in the superior court for santa clara county  california captioned korsinsky v 
tran  et al 
the state action 
plaintiffs in the federal and state actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company in connection with the alleged backdating of stock option grants during the period from through and that certain defendants were unjustly enriched 
plaintiffs in the federal action assert derivative claims against the individual defendants based on alleged violations of sections b  a and a of the securities exchange act of  and rules b and a promulgated thereunder 
they also allege that the individual defendants aided and abetted one another s alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and violated california corporations code section and bring claims for an accounting and rescission 
in the state action  plaintiffs also allege that the individual defendants wasted corporate assets 
both actions seek to recover unspecified money damages  disgorgement of profits and benefits and equitable relief 
the federal action also seeks treble damages  rescission of certain defendants option contracts  imposition of a constructive trust over executory option contracts and attorney s fees 
the company is named as a nominal defendant in both the federal and state actions  thus  no recovery against the company is sought 
the company has filed a motion to dismiss the federal action on the ground that the plaintiffs had not made a pre litigation demand on the company s board of directors and had not demonstrated that such a demand would have been futile 
the defendant directors and officers joined in that motion  and filed a motion to dismiss the federal action for failure to state a claim against each of them 
the company has also filed a motion 
table of contents to dismiss or stay the state action in favor of the earlier filed federal action 
the defendant directors and officers joined in that motion 
pursuant to a joint stipulation  the court ordered that the state action be stayed in favor of the earlier filed federal action 
the company has previously disclosed in press releases that the securities and exchange commission sec has initiated an informal inquiry into the company s stock option granting practices

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock for each quarter in the last two fiscal years 
in september  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended july  the second quarter form q  we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule c and were therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
in december  we received an additional similar letter from nasdaq related to our form q for the quarter ended october  the third quarter form q 
in january  the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted our request for continued listing  provided that we file a written summary of our audit committee s option review status with nasdaq as well as the second quarter form q  the third quarter form q and any required restatements with the sec on or before march  in february  we received a notice from the nasdaq listing and hearings review council which advised us that any delisting determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel has been stayed pending further review by the nasdaq review council 
we have been given until may  to submit additional information to assist the nasdaq review council in their assessment of our listing status 
on february   we filed a written summary of the status of our audit committee s review with nasdaq 
in addition  on april   we filed this form k and the second quarter form q and the third quarter form q with the sec 
we consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c  subject to nasdaq s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly 
however  if nasdaq disagrees with our position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market

during the investigation  the audit committee reviewed stock option grants to officers  directors and employees from to encompassing approximately  grants on different grant dates 
on september   we announced that certain of the actual measurement dates for prior option grants may differ from the recorded measurement dates 
the audit committee concluded its investigation in april its investigation found that nearly all of the stock option grants for new hires  as well as for promotion and retention  were approved by the use of unanimous written consents uwc or uwcs of the company s board  rather than at a board meeting 
the audit committee found that the company s process resulted in grant dates on the uwcs routinely established before 
table of contents the receipt of fully signed uwcs authorizing such grants 
the audit committee also found that due to these and other deficiencies in the administration of our stock option plans  a number of options grants between and were misdated 
the audit committee has concluded that the stock option grant process  including the uwc process described above  reflected management s lack of appreciation of the legal and accounting standards of the stock option grant process and the erroneous belief that dates other than the stated grant date were  at best  administrative in nature and not governing 
based on the quarterly low price points of the option grants  and absent any objective documentation to the contrary  the audit committee has also speculated that the ultimate selection of the grant dates stated on the uwcs may have benefited from limited hindsight  but it has not found any conclusive evidence to this effect 
the audit committee did not find any evidence of intent to deceive or to destroy or alter documents or to obstruct or impede the investigation in any way 
as a result of the review  the audit committee recommended the prompt hiring of a cfo with extensive public experience and gaap knowledge 
a new cfo joined the company on february  the audit committee also recommended the following changes to the process by which the company grants stock options  which the company has commenced implementing require approval of all option grants at a board meeting and that uwcs no longer be used 
improvement in internal controls revise stock option documentation and create appropriate controls for annual  new hire and promotion option grant preparation  presentation for approval  entry into equity edge stock option database  and notification to employees 
adopt specific internal control that all internal approvals for stock option grants be obtained prior to presentation to the compensation committee or board action 
develop an annual plan for issuance of options together with guidelines for the number and types of stock option awards that are offered to the different salary grades  which shall be reviewed and approved annually by the compensation committee after or in connection with the board s approval of the annual business plan 
training the company  under the direction of the cfo  will establish cross functional training for personnel in all areas associated with the stock option granting process the training will cover i stock option and other equity award programs and related improvements to equity compensation controls  processes and procedures  ii accounting implications of equity award grants  and iii legal and tax implications of equity award grants 
the company will require that all personnel responsible for stock option administration participate in training at least annually  including i chief executive officer and all direct reports  ii finance department members  iii hr department members  iv stock administration department members  and v all new employees involved in the above listed functions or roles 
because of the time required to complete our internal investigation and determine the appropriate accounting treatment  we have been delinquent in filing our quarterly reports on form q for the three month period ended july  and the three month period ended october  those reports have been filed concurrently with this form k 
related to the special investigation and financial statement restatements through the filing date of all delinquent filings  we have incurred approximately million in costs for legal fees  external audit firm fees  and external consulting fees through fiscal year ended february   and expect to incur approximately million of additional fees 

table of contents accounting considerations stock based compensation we originally accounted for all employee  officer and director stock option grants as fixed grants under apb  using a measurement date of the recorded grant date 
we issued all grants with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the recorded grant date  and therefore originally recorded no stock based compensation expense 
as a result of the findings of the investigation conducted by the audit committee and our own further review of our stock option granting practices  we determined that  although fixed accounting under apb was appropriate  the measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates for such grants 
in some instances  we were only able to locate sufficient evidence to identify the measurement date described in apb  the first date on which both the number of shares that an individual employee was entitled to receive and the exercise price were known  within a range of possible dates 
as a result  we developed a methodology to establish the revised measurement date as our estimate of the first date on which both the number of shares that an individual employee was entitled to receive and the exercise price were known with finality 
using the methodology described below  we concluded that it was appropriate to revise the measurement dates for these grants based upon our findings  and we refer to these revised measurement dates as the deemed measurement dates 
we calculated stock based compensation expense under apb based upon the intrinsic value as of the deemed measurement dates of stock option awards determined to be fixed under apb and the vesting provisions of the underlying options 
we calculated the intrinsic value on the deemed measurement date as the closing price of our common stock on such date as reported on the nasdaq national market  now the nasdaq global market  less the exercise price per share of common stock as stated in the underlying stock option agreement  multiplied by the number of shares subject to such stock option award 
we recognized these amounts as compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying options generally four years 
the methodology developed by such advisor was used by us  with such advisor s assistance  to determine the deemed measurement dates associated with prior stock option grants was as follows new hire non officer employee stock options effective january effective january  we amended our practice of granting options to new hire non officer employees to grant all such options at the end of the quarter in which the employee was hired 
accordingly  we determined the deemed measurement date for each of these grants to be the last business day of the quarter of the employee s quarter of hire  because it was determined to be the first date when the number of shares and the price of each grant were known with finality 
all other stock options we determined the deemed measurement dates for all stock option grants other than those described above to be either the approval date or the communication date for the stock option grant 
the approval date was used in each case that it was reliably determined  and the communication date was used in those cases where the approval date could not be determined or was determined to be unreliable 
the approval date for the stock option was the date set forth in executed minutes or a fully executed consent of the board of directors or stock option committee  provided that documentary evidence existed that the allocation of shares had been finalized on such date  and the communication date for the stock option was within days of the approval date 
the communication date for the stock option was the date we determined the key terms of the option both the number of shares and the exercise price to be initially communicated to the optionee 
in the absence of specific documentary evidence of initial communication  we generally determined the communication date to be the earliest of the date the employee record was added to the stock option database application the record add date  the optionee manual signature date on the stock option agreement the stock option agreement date  and for officers and directors  the date that a form or was filed with the sec with respect to the grant the form date 
however  if we determined that the earliest date was the record add date  and if 
table of contents the stock option agreement date was more than days after the record add date  then we determined the communication date to be the earlier of the stock option agreement date or the form date 
when applying this methodology to groups of grants  we generally determined the communication date for the group to be the latest record add date  the earliest stock option agreement date  as we determined that  under our stock option grant process  the terms of stock options were generally communicated concurrently to each member of the group 
we excluded a limited number of options  or outliers  from the determination of the latest record add date and the earliest stock option agreement date for a group of grants when  based upon available evidence  we considered the outlier dates as not reliable as to the date that the terms of the stock option grants were communicated to the group 
we determined that variable accounting under apb  which is required in situations when the terms of option grants are modified subsequent to the date that all granting actions are complete  was not applicable for any of the grants during the review period 
the methodology described above  and the determination of which stock option grants should be considered outliers  as described above  involves judgment 
we believe that the judgments applied are consistent with the provisions of the appropriate accounting pronouncements and the letter from the office of the chief accountant of the sec to the financial executives international and the american institute of certified public accountants dated september  as stated above  using this methodology  we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge for stock compensation related adjustments of million relating to the restatement period 
if we had consistently used the record add date as the deemed measurement date for all grants in which the recorded grant date could not be relied upon and excluded outliers  consistent with the application of our methodology  the aggregate pre tax stock based compensation charges relating to the restatement period would have been approximately million 
alternatively  if we would have used the highest or lowest trading prices of our common stock between the last date of documentary approval evidence which was otherwise deemed unreliable  generally because the date of all approvals could not be verified before the deemed measurement date and the deemed measurement date  since a measurement date could have occurred on any date between those two dates  the aggregate pre tax stock based compensation charges relating to the same periods would have been million if we had used the lowest price and million if we had used the highest price 
restatement adjustments our restated consolidated financial statements contained in this form k incorporate stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes  penalties and interest expenses 
the restatement adjustments result in a million increase in accumulated deficit as of april  this amount includes a reduction of our previously reported consolidated net income of approximately million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively  and  for the quarter ended april  the total restatement impact for periods through january  of million has been reflected as a prior period adjustment to accumulated deficit as of that date 
the restatement adjustments reduced our previously reported diluted earnings per share by and for the years ended january  and january   respectively 

table of contents the table below presents the impact of the individual restatement adjustments in thousands  which are explained in further detail following the table three months ended april  fiscal years stock based compensation expense accelerated vesting and extended exercisability payroll taxes  interest and penalties total stock based expenses less compensation expense previously recorded net adjustment to net income loss due to stock based compensation add other accounting adjustments total adjustments to net income loss stock based compensation these adjustments are from our determination  that the initially recorded measurement dates of option grants during the review period could not be relied upon  based upon the audit committee s investigation and our subsequent reviews and analyses 
for substantially all such option grants  there was correspondence or other evidence that indicated that not all required corporate approvals had been obtained as of the initially recorded measurement date 
we adopted a methodology to remeasure these option grants to a revised measurement date  as described below  and accounted for these grants as fixed awards under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb accelerated vesting and extended exercisability these adjustments were made as a result of the acceleration of stock option vesting upon termination and the extension of the exercisability of certain options held by a few employees 
payroll taxes  interest and penalties in connection with the stock based compensation adjustments  we determined that certain options previously classified as incentive stock options under the us internal revenue code irc  or isos  were determined to have been granted with an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the revised measurement date see discussion under accounting considerations below 
under irc tax regulations  isos may not be granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant  and therefore these grants might not qualify for iso tax treatment 
we refer to these stock options as the affected isos 
the potential disqualification of iso status exposes us to additional payroll related withholding taxes on the exercise of options granted to us employees  and penalties and interest for failing to properly withhold taxes on exercise of those options 
as of february   we have recorded a net liability of approximately million in connection with the potential disqualification of iso tax treatment for option awards 
the payroll tax  interest and penalty expenses were recorded in the periods in which the underlying stock options were exercised 
then  in subsequent periods in which the liabilities were legally extinguished due to expiration of the statutes of limitations  the expenses were reversed  and recognized as a reduction in the related functional expense category in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents because virtually all holders of options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing of the affected isos  we have taken certain actions and are considering possible additional actions to address the impact of certain adverse tax consequences  including that irc section a  that may result from the exercise price of stock options being less than the fair market value of our common stock on the deemed measurement date  as defined below 
irc section a and  as applicable  similar tax laws in california and other states imposes penalty taxes on our employees on stock options granted with an exercise price lower than the fair market value on the date of grant that vest after december  the a affected options 
the internal revenue service irs has issued transition rules under irc section a that allows for a correction  or cure  for a affected options 
in december  we entered into agreements with each of our executive officers to amend the a affected options held by such persons to limit the period of exercisability to a defined calendar year 
further  prior to december   the company may offer other holders of a affected options the opportunity to effect a cure of all such options by either increasing the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or  if lower  the market price at the time of the amendment or limiting the period of exercisability to a defined calendar year 
the company may approve bonuses payable to holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price 
the amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid although there is no assurance that the options will be exercised 
if necessary to comply with applicable law  such cure will be effected as a tender offer 
in connection with such cure  the company may pay approximately million in to non officer employees of the company 
for those employees who exercised a a affected option during  as a precautionary measure  we have sent the irs and california franchise tax board ftb notices of our intent to participate in settlement programs they have developed to allow employers to pay certain taxes on behalf of employees to settle potential taxes resulting from the exercise of these a affected options during in connection with the company s proposed participation in these programs  the company may pay an aggregate of approximately million to the irs and ftb 
the company may also approve bonuses of an aggregate of approximately million payable to these effected employees to compensate them for additional income tax imposed on them as a result of the payments the company may make on their behalf to the irs and ftb 
income tax benefit provision because of the potential impact of the measurement date changes on the qualified status of affected isos  we have determined that all affected isos might not be qualified as isos under irs regulations  and therefore should be accounted for as if they were nonstatutory stock options under the irc  or nsos  for income tax accounting purposes 
however  we recorded no income tax benefit associated with stock based compensation and related charges because of valuation allowances provided against the resulting deferred tax assets  as we believe that sufficient doubt exists that we will be able to realize the value of those assets 
other accounting adjustments in addition to the stock based compensation adjustments described above  we also made certain other adjustments to our previously reported net income loss as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k  during our fiscal audit  we determined that incorrect measurement dates were used to value stock options exchanged with the employees previously with blue upon the acquisition 
as a result  the increase in purchase price of million was recorded as an increase to both goodwill and future stock based compensation expense as of the date of acquisition 
this compensation expense will be amortized to our consolidated statement of operations over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded incremental stock based compensation expense of  as also discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k  during our fiscal audit  we determined that the collection of our french research and development 
table of contents tax credit was reasonably assured and  therefore  should have been accounted for using the accrual method  whereas such credits were previously recorded upon the receipt of cash 
as a result  we restated our previously reported operating results for fiscal years through to record aggregate income of  in interest and other income 
additionally  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  for fiscal and prior years we accrued and expensed estimated audit and tax professional fees ratably during the fiscal year prior to such services being actually performed 
as a result  we restated fiscal years through to reflect the expensing of such audit and tax professional fees as the services were performed 
the restatement for this element resulted in increases decreases in general and administrative expenses of zero   and  for each of fiscal year   and  respectively 
as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k  during our fiscal audit  we restated our previously reported operating results for fiscal years through to record certain adjustments to previously provided income taxes 
these adjustments amounted to an aggregate increase in income tax provision and income taxes payable of  to reflect income taxes related to our foreign subsidiaries 
we restated our previously reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal to record an increase to our warranty reserve and warranty expense of  in addition to the above adjustments  reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to the current year presentation 
for a complete description of matter affecting the results in the tables below  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item related proceedings several derivative actions related to the stock option grants were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers 
these cases are discussed under legal proceedings in item and in note  legal proceedings  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as we disclosed on july   the sec commenced an informal inquiry into our stock option grant processes 
we are cooperating with the sec and intend to continue to do so 
nasdaq listing status in september  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended july  the second quarter form q  we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule c and were therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
in december  we received an additional similar letter from nasdaq related to our form q for the quarter ended october  the third quarter form q 
in january  the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted our request for continued listing  provided that we file a written summary of our audit committee s option review status with nasdaq as well as the second quarter form q  the third quarter form q and any required restatements with the sec on or before march  in february  we received a notice from the nasdaq listing and hearings review council which advised us that any delisting determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel has been stayed pending further review by the nasdaq review council 
we have been given until may  to submit additional information to assist the nasdaq review council in their assessment of our listing status 
on february   we filed a written summary of the status of our audit committee s review with nasdaq 
in addition  on april   we filed the second quarter form q and the third quarter form q with the sec 
we consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c  subject to nasdaq s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly 
however  if nasdaq 
table of contents disagrees with our position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market

our chipset products consist primarily of video and audio decoding chips under the names of em series  em series  em series  eml series and smp series for the ip video technology market  connected media player market as well as the pc add in market 
we began volume shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal of our smp series chipset product  which is our latest solution in the iptv  blu ray and hd dvd  hdtv  and digital media adapter markets 
this chipset product series represented of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal our chipset sales increase in fiscal over was in part attributable to our customers having their products launch after successful initial trails 
we believe our success with the smp series chipset product demonstrates our success in the recently emerging  high growth iptv and connected media markets 
our board products consist primarily of certain customized development boards that are sold into the internet protocol ip video technology market  connected media player market and pc add in market and  more recently to a lesser extent  a series of pc based solutions using the netstream and xcard brand names 
we also offer development kits  engineering support services  and chipset customization engineering development

we derive our revenues from sales of our chipset and board products to corporate customers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who in turn incorporate our products into technologies that are sold into the consumer electronics market 
we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our oems and receive substantially all of our revenues based on purchase orders 
we work with both oems and end users of our products to better understand the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 

table of contents the vast majority of our revenues are derived from our chipset product solutions 
our markets are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of customers to design our chips into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
in the past  we have had to reduce our prices significantly to meet customer requirements 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets for our products mature  new technologies emerge  and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
critical accounting policies estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  stock based compensation  goodwill and purchase intangible assets  warranty reserves  deferred tax assets and litigation and settlement costs 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenues for product sales and service contracts in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenues are deferred when management cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers  often referred to as a sell through basis 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
product development agreements typically require that we provide customized software to support customer specific designs  accordingly this revenue is accounted for under the aicpa statement of position sop we offer post contract customer support pcs on a contractual basis for additional fees  which is typically a one year term 
in instances where software is bundled with the pcs  vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement and  therefore  revenue and related costs are deferred until all elements  except pcs are delivered 
the total fee is then recognized ratably over the pcs term typically one year after the software is delivered 
we classify development costs related to product development agreements as cost of revenues 
product development revenues were approximately  million and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenues from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services  and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
expenses related to support service revenues are included in cost of sales 
support service revenues were   and  for fiscal  and respectively 

table of contents accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by to days beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding credit worthiness 
in establishing our sales return allowance  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for bad debt allowance and sales return in the total amount of   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if our expectations change or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving consideration for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to provide additional inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
stock based compensation effective january   the start of our fiscal year  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and  therefore  have not revised prior periods results for the adoption of this accounting statement 
sfas r requires all share based payments to be measured based on the award s fair value on the date of grant  and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes option pricing model is based on a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected forfeiture rates  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if the assumptions change  stock based compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
for fiscal years and  stock based compensation is determined under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  whereby the difference in value between the recorded grant date and the respective measurement date  including payroll taxes  interest and penalties  is recorded 
in connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements  we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants 
information regarding the restatement  including ranges of possible additional stock based compensation expense if other measurement dates had been selected for certain grants  is set forth in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and in note restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets we record goodwill as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step test be performed to assess goodwill for impairment 
first  the fair value of 
table of contents each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
the fair value of tangible net assets and both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets is deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
the estimates we have used for evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used  we could incur impairment charges 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are currently amortizing acquired intangible assets with definite lives 
acquired developed technology is amortized over years and noncompete agreements are amortized over the contractual period currently years 
the amortization expense for acquired developed technology is classified as cost of sales and the amortization expense for other acquired intangible assets is classified as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would provide an income tax benefit that would increase income in the period such determination was made 
currently  we record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the high uncertainty of our ability to realize these assets 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement chargers 
if any of these events were to happen  our business  financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fas no 

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 

table of contents the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in a an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable  b a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or c both a and b 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be de recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
use of a valuation allowance as described in fas no 
is not an appropriate substitute for the de recognition of a tax position 
the requirement to assess the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on sufficiency of future taxable income is unchanged by this interpretation 
this interpretation is effective for the company on february  the company is currently evaluating the impact fin no 
will have to the company s consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operation

net revenues our net revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased chipset sales into the iptv  blue ray and hd dvd  hdtv and digital media adaptor marketplaces 
our net revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in revenues was due to increasing demand for our products  which increased unit volume was partially offset by lower average selling prices 
net revenues by product group we have three main product groups chipsets  board and other products 
the following table sets forth our net revenues in each of our major product group and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each product group  for the last three years in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal chipsets boards other total net revenues chipsets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building products for the iptv  blue ray and hd dvd  hdtv  digital media adaptor  and portable media player markets 
the increase of million  or  in net revenues from chipsets in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in sales into the newer generation of combined iptv  blue ray and hd dvd  hdtv  and digital media adaptor product markets  offset by a million decrease in sales of our legacy products 
the increase of million  or  in net revenues from chipsets in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased unit sales of our chipsets into the ip video technology market and connected media player market offset by the lower average selling price given to large original equipment manufacturers for volume orders

our board level product lines target oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market  system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets and consumer markets for upgraded multimedia products 
the decrease of  or in net revenues from board products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased demand 
the increase of  or  in net revenues from board products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to increased unit sales of development reference boards to the various markets partially offset by decreased unit sales of project based board products for ip video applications 
we anticipate our revenues from board products to be relatively flat or decrease in future periods due to our strategic decision to focus on our chipset products 
other 
the other category primarily includes revenue from development kits  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets  freight fees and other accessories 
the costs related to support service revenues and certain small development contracts were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses  respectively 
the decrease of  or  in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to our desire to focus our research and development resources on chipsets 
the decrease in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the decreased revenues from engineering support services and other accessories

hdtv product market 
we began shipment of hdtv applications during the second quarter of fiscal and experienced an increase in demand through fiscal we expect revenues in the hdtv product market to expand  as occurred in fiscal  although we expect this to remain a small percentage of our overall revenues 
pc add in and other markets 
the pc add in and other markets consists of pc add in board and chipset products  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets  freight fees and other accessories 
the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primary due to an increase in nonrecurring engineering revenues 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in and other markets in fiscal was due to the decreased engineering development revenues  support services and other accessories as compared to fiscal we expect our revenues from sales to the pc add in and other markets to continue to decline due to declining demand in the general market and we expect our revenues from engineering development to fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and complexity of the projects required by our customers

north american revenues increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was largely due to our customers initial trails and successful launches 
north american revenues decreased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely due to the decreased unit sales of our board products to the ip video technology market  which was partially offset by the increased unit sales of our chipset products 
this was due primarily to customers increasingly incorporating our chipsets into their final products 
in addition  there was a shift of chipset orders from our customers in the north american region to our customers in the asia region 
we expect that our revenues from north america in any given period may fluctuate depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through their

our gross profit between fiscal and fiscal was relatively flat 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues was million in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal our gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily related to the introduction of our iptv set top product at expected forward volume pricing  while incurring early volume ramp production costs 
this forward volume pricing was established as part of our strategy to obtain a leading share of the iptv set top box market 
the decrease in gross margin was also due in part to anticipated lower gross margins in the high volume iptv set top box market versus those of our other products  which are higher gross margin products that serve lower volume niche markets 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to lower average selling prices provided to original equipment manufacturers for volume orders  and an increase in stock based 
table of contents compensation expense and related payroll taxes  interest and penalties of  in addition  the costs related to service revenues and certain small development contracts were included in sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses see reference to critical accounting policies revenue recognition  while our expense for inventory obsolescence increased cost of revenues by million   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  cost of revenues in fiscal included  of accelerated depreciation expense due to reduction of estimated useful live for certain testing equipment 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales  average selling prices  volume order discounts  our costs  the extent of development fees  changes in estimated useful lives of production testing equipment and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
because average selling prices of our products typically decline over the life of a product  if we are unable to reduce costs faster than the rate of such decline or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our gross margins will decline

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue while limiting the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
our primary sources of funds have been proceeds from common stock issuances and borrowings under bank lines of credit 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has also been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations for the fiscal  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash 
table of contents and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our primary uses of cash  which include our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments  and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants under our existing asset based banking agreements  and to renew those lines of credit upon their expiration  in order to maintain the availability of funds under these agreements 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities during or beyond the next months  and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned

we do not expect to utilize this shelf registration statement prior to its expiration 
line of credit and term loan on august   we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with united commercial bank the bank 
the loan agreement provides for a maximum borrowing amount of approximately million across three credit facilities consisting of two year lines of credit and a month term loan of  our lines of credit are used to fund daily operating cash needs 
during the ordinary course of business  the use of the lines of credit is driven by collection and disbursement activities 
our daily cash needs generally follow a predictable pattern that parallels our payroll cycles  which drive  as necessary  our short term borrowing requirements 
the first year lines of credit allows us to borrow up to of our accounts receivable  but in no event greater than million  has a floating interest rate of the wall street journal prime rate plus per annum 
the second year lines of credit allows us to borrow up to million as long as our unrestricted cash at the bank exceeds million  the credit limit of the first year line of credit is utilized and the total outstanding balances under both year lines of credit cannot exceed million at any one time 
the second year line of credit has a floating interest rate of the wall street journal prime rate plus per annum 
our obligations under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including 
table of contents our intellectual property 
both lines of credit expire and are payable in full on august  at our option  we can repay the loans under the loan agreement without premium or penalty 
as of february   we had no amounts outstanding under these two lines of credit but had availability to draw down approximately million 
on february   we have utilized million of the first year line of credit for issuance of a standby letter of credit to a supplier 
principal amounts under the term loan will become due and payable on a monthly basis such that the term loan will be fully repaid in february the term loan has a floating interest rate of the wall street journal prime rate plus per annum 
the effective average interest rate paid on the term loan from january   through february   was approximately 
as of february   we had  outstanding under the term loan 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain financial covenants 
as of february   we were not in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  and have obtained waivers from the lenders 
contractual obligations and commitments we do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
we generally maintain products for distribution through corporate markets based on forecasts rather than firm purchase orders 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our oem customers only after receiving purchase orders from such customers  which purchase orders with delivery dates greater than weeks are typically cancelable without substantial penalty from such oem customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor products from our suppliers on an eight to twelve week lead time basis 
the following table sets forth the amounts in thousands of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of february  contractual obligations payments due by period year or less years years years or more total operating leases term loan non cancelable purchase orders on april   we entered into a sublease agreement to rent approximately  square feet of a facility from a start up company founded by a member of our board of directors 
this is a month to month operating lease with base rent of  plus proportionate share of operating costs commencing april  on february   we entered into a new lease agreement for a new approximately  square foot facility in milpitas  california in which we intend to relocate our headquarters sometime before the expiration of our current lease 
the new lease will commence on june  and expire in september we will pay a monthly base rent plus common area maintenance and building operating expenses 
the monthly base rent ranges from approximately  to  with free base rent for the initial three months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity as of february   we held approximately million of short term investments generally consisting of the us government and corporate debt securities with an average original maturity of less than one year 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these short term investments would not have a material impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
in additions  we had borrowings outstanding of  under a term loan agreement for financing equipment for research and development  and no borrowings outstanding under our two variable interest rate bank lines of credit 
if short term interest rates were to increase  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies of our subsidiaries in hong kong and france  respectively 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at february   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
