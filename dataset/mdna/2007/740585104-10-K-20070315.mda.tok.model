income taxes in  and  our effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate  primarily as a result of non deductible compensation costs and changes in valuation allowances 
changes in valuation allowances are required when facts and circumstances surrounding these estimates have changed 
the provision for income taxes and corresponding balance sheet accounts are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  the deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on temporary differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes  in addition to net operating loss carryforwards which are reasonably assured of being utilized 
these differences are primarily attributable to the recognition of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and intangible assets  allowances for doubtful accounts and certain employee benefit accruals 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have reserves for certain asserted international and state income tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation in accordance with sfas no

during  we provided for approximately million of additional reserves based on the preliminary results of an audit with a state that questioned our methodology used in allocating taxable income to it from other states in which we are not subject to income tax 
we believe our methodology is consistent with generally accepted methods used in other states but believe that it is more likely than not we will incur this liability 
this amount is classified as income taxes payable on the face of the consolidated balance sheet 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these inquiries may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize income tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we are appropriately reserved for income taxes 
if we are required to pay amounts that differ from our reserves for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the uncertain tax matter is settled 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimated reserves  we may need to make an adjustment which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations

during  we also changed the estimated liability for certain lease obligations associated with the discontinued operations of our former voicecom reportable segment 
the change is associated with the failure to sublease certain floor space that was assumed in the original estimate 
during  we adjusted the estimated liability for certain lease obligations associated with the discontinued operations of our former voicecom business segment

capital resources in april  we closed an amendment to our credit facility  with a syndicate led by bank of america  na  that increased the amount available to us under our line of credit from million to million  reduced the applicable percentages across the pricing grid and extended the maturity of the credit facility from february to april the amendment also provided for an uncommitted accordion feature allowing for an additional increase of million to million of the revolving credit line  subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the amendment 
the credit facility is subject to customary covenants for secured credit facilities of this nature 
certain of our material domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged as collateral all of the issued and outstanding stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of our material foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants under our line of credit and have obtained any required waivers or consents from lenders  as applicable 
proceeds drawn under this credit agreement may be used for refinancing of existing debt  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under the line of credit  at our option  is the base rate the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank of america prime rate or libor  plus  in each case  an applicable margin which will vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   the applicable margin with respect to base rate loans was  and the applicable margin with respect to libor loans was 
at december   our interest rate on day libor loans was 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our line of credit 
in february  we entered into a three year million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of plus applicable spread  and in august  we entered into two separate three year million interest rate swaps at and respectively 
these swaps are exclusive of our applicable margin as stated in our credit facility 
we have not designated these interest rate swaps as hedges and are accounting for them in accordance with sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in fair value  which were approximately million for the twelve months ended december   are recognized in earnings 
in march and september  we entered into a yen denominated line of credit for million and million  respectively  with sumitomo mitsui banking  which has an interest rate of on million and on million through april as of december  there were no outstanding borrowings

the principal balance at december  was million 
at december   we had no other indebtedness outstanding except for the borrowings under our lines of credit  the capital lease obligations listed above and an acquired capital lease with a principal balance of million 
liquidity as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic business segments for the twelve months ended december  each geographic business segment had sufficient cash flows from operations to service existing debt obligations and to fund capital expenditure requirements  which have historically been to of annual consolidated revenues  and to fund research and development costs for new services and enhancements to existing services  which have historically been approximately to of annual consolidated revenues 
in  capital expenditure funding requirements were slightly higher than our historical averages due to new product development and capacity expansion 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
we have historically borrowed on our line of credit in order to fund acquisitions 
at december   we had million of available credit on our existing million line of credit 
we regularly review our capital structure and evaluate potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  cash flows from our operating segments and other factors  we may engage in other capital transactions

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  investments  restructuring costs and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue which results from non calendar month billing cycles 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a  b and sab should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectibility is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed reviews as of january   and and immediately prior to the change in our segment reporting in the fourth quarter of with no impairments identified 
other intangible assets with finite lives that do not meet the criteria of sfas no 
continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income taxes payable  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset as of december  and was million and million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded this valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also have reserves for certain asserted international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring costs restructuring reserves are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments to individuals outside of the us are less than initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with fas no 
 we accrue an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of legal claims 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our estimates are subject to change and we adjust the financial impact in the period in which they are resolved 
see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the sec staff added section n to staff sab topic through the issuance of financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when qualifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how a registrant should evaluate whether an error in its financial statements is material 
the guidance in sab will be effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of our fiscal year beginning january   as required 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts  as applicable 
we have not determined the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the provisions of eitf became effective as of january  eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and the timing of intercompany payable settlements 
in addition  in february  we entered into a three year million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of  and in august  we entered into two separate three year million interest rate swaps at and respectively 
all of these swaps are exclusive of our applicable margin as stated in our credit facility 
these interest rate swaps effectively convert the interest payments of million of our libor based borrowings to a fixed rate 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our line of credit that are subject to interest rate risk 
each basis point increase in interest rates relative to these borrowings would impact annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million based on our december  debt level 
approximately and of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations and and of our operating expenses from continuing operations were transacted in foreign currencies in and  respectively 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales and operating income 
a hypothetical positive or negative change of in foreign currency exchange rates would positively or negatively change revenues for by approximately million and operating expenses for by approximately million 
our principal exposure has been related to local currency sales and operating costs in the euro zone  canada  the united kingdom  australia and japan 
we have not used derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange risk  and no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding at december
