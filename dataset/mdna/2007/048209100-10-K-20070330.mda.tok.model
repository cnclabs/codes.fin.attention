item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively  the company for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted through a group of regional insurance companies american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty  georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty  and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately based upon the geographic location or the type of products offered and is evaluated on its individual performance 
management has conformed information systems  policies and procedures  products  marketing and managerial responsibilities between association casualty and georgia casualty to create a southern regional property and casualty operation and increase efficiencies 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ from management s initial estimates determined using these policies 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised of the company s liabilities at december  this obligation includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses  are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuarial staff develops ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method  the reported bornhuetter ferguson method  the berquist sherman method and a frequency severity method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical cost inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previous estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given previous calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
annually  the company performs an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers using various data sources 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies or disputes could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and  accordingly  at their estimated fair values 
the company owns certain non redeemable preferred stocks that do not have quoted values and are carried at estimated fair values as determined by management 
such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  primarily due to changes in credit risk  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income taxes comprised approximately of the company s total assets at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

contractual obligations the following table discloses the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank debt payable junior subordinated debentures interest payable operating leases purchase commitments losses and claims future policy benefits unearned premiums other policy liabilities total interest payable is based on interest rates as of december  and assumes that all debt remains outstanding until its stated contractual maturity 
the interest rates on outstanding bank debt and trust preferred obligations are variable and are equal to three month libor plus an applicable predetermined margin 
represents balances due for goods and or services which have been contractually committed as of december  to the extent contracts provide for early termination with notice but without penalty  only the amounts contractually due during the notice period have been included 
losses and claims include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company  the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr reserves is an estimate  subject to significant uncertainty 
the actual amount to be paid 
table of contents is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with any applicable claimant 
final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future 
in estimating the timing of future payments by year  the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue 
however  the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to  among other things  changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements 
amounts reflected do not include reinsurance amounts which may also be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss 
future policy benefits relate to life insurance policies on which the company is not currently making payments and will not make future payments unless and until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as a death or disability  or the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy 
occurrence of any of these events is outside the control of the company and the payment estimates are based on significant uncertainties such as mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns  inflation and the timing of payments 
for regulatory purposes  the company does perform cash flow modeling of such liabilities  which is the basis for the indicated disclosure  however  due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amount presented could materially differ from actual results 
unearned premiums represent potential future revenue for the company  however  under certain circumstances  such premiums may be refundable with cancellation of the underlying policy 
significantly all unearned premiums will be earned within the following twelve month period as the related future insurance protection is provided 
significantly all costs related to such unearned premiums have already been incurred and paid and are included in deferred acquisition costs  however  future losses related to the unearned premiums have not been recorded 
the contractual obligations related to unearned premiums reflected in the table represent the average loss ratio applied to the year end unearned premium balances  with loss payments projected in comparable proportions to the year end loss and claims reserves 
projecting future losses is subject to significant uncertainties and the projected payments will most likely vary materially from these estimates as a result of differences in future severity  frequency and other anticipated and unanticipated factors 
amounts reflected do not take into account reinsurance amounts which may be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss
