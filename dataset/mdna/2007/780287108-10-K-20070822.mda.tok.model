item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operation of royal gold and its subsidiaries 
this discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three fiscal years ended june  overview royal gold  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or production from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or near production in exchange for royalty interests 
we also fund exploration on properties thought to contain precious metals and seek to obtain royalties and other carried ownership interests in such properties through the subsequent transfer of operating interests to other mining companies 
substantially all of our revenues are and will be expected to be derived from royalty interests 
we do not conduct mining operations at this time 
during the fiscal year  we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests  the acquisition of royalty interests  and the creation of royalty interests through financing and strategic exploration alliances 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and other metals  as well as production from our royalty properties 
during the fiscal year  the price of gold averaged per ounce compared with an average price of per ounce for the fiscal year 
payments received from the recently acquired robinson and mulatos royalties  along with an increase in production at the leeville mining complex and the troy mine contributed to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to royalty revenue of million during the fiscal year ended june  please see part i  item  business  and part i  item  properties  of this annual report on form k for discussion on royal gold s producing  development stage and exploration stage royalty interests

internal review of stock option matters on december   a wall street journal article raised the topic that certain officers of public companies  including the chairman of the company  may have backdated the exercise of certain of their options based on the frequency of exercises occurring on dates with low trading prices during the month of exercise 
promptly after learning of the story  the chairman of the company advised the board of directors audit committee regarding the matter 
the audit committee then initiated a voluntary review and retained independent counsel to assist in its review of stock option practices 
on february   the independent counsel made its final report to the audit committee of its findings 
the principal findings of that report were as follows the review of stock option exercise information covered the period from to the review found no evidence that the company had a policy or sanctioned practice of permitting backdating of stock option exercise dates 
independent counsel was unable to conclude that intentional backdating of stock option exercise dates occurred  or to rule out the possibility that such intentional backdating did occur 
counsel found several instances in which two current officers and several former officers of the company and two instances in which a former outside director exercised stock options on the day or days when the trading price for the company s common stock during the month of exercise was lowest 
independent counsel found that the conduct of the current president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  and controller is not implicated in any way in the issues that were subject of the review 

table of contents the review found no evidence that any current or former officer s conduct involved any effort to mislead investors  to inaccurately improve the financial results of the company  or to obtain any personal benefit at the expense of the company 
independent counsel also reviewed the company s stock option grant procedures since the review found no evidence that the company s stock option grant dates had been backdated 
independent counsel also found historical weaknesses in internal controls with respect to exercise of stock options and the stock option practices generally  but found that such historical weaknesses in internal controls have been remediated 
since  internal controls regarding the company s stock option practices have been substantially upgraded 
the company has concluded that there is no tax or financial statement impact resulting from the review of its stock option exercise and grant practices

 was issued 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for our fiscal year beginning july  the company is evaluating the impact the adoption of fin could have on our financial statements  however  the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements 
statement no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
statement no 
applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under statement no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the provisions of statement no 
are effective for our fiscal year beginning july   and interim periods within the fiscal year 
the company is evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of statement no 
could have on our financial statements 
also in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practices surrounding how public companies quantify and evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab provides that once a current year misstatement has been quantified  the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 financial statements materiality  should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material and should result in an adjustment to the financial statements 
sab is effective for the first fiscal year ending after november  the company elected early application of sab during its third quarter ending march  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the effect of the company s early application of sab in february  the fasb issued statement no

could have on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that the company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of third party mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 

table of contents royalty interests in mineral properties as of june   the net carrying value of royalty interests in mineral properties was approximately million 
royalty interests in mineral properties include acquired royalty interests in production stage  development stage and exploration stage properties 
the fair value of acquired royalty interests in mineral properties are capitalized as tangible assets when such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset under the financial accounting standard board s fasb statement of financial account standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacements of fasb statement no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
acquisition costs of production and development stage royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property  which is estimated using proven and probable reserves 
acquisition costs of royalty interests on exploration stage mineral properties  where there are no proven and probable reserves  are not amortized 
at such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves  the cost basis is amortized over the remaining life of the mineral property  using proven and probable reserves 
the carrying values of exploration stage mineral interests are evaluated for impairment at such time as information becomes available indicating that the production will not occur in the future 
exploration costs are charged to operations when incurred 
royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended june   we received royalty revenue of approximately million 
royalty revenue is recognized pursuant to guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition for financial statements 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying royalty agreements subject to i the pervasive evidence of the existence of the arrangements  ii the risks and rewards having been transferred  iii the royalty being fixed or determinable  and iv the collectibility of the royalty being reasonably assured 
for royalty payments received in gold  royalty revenue is recorded at the average spot price of gold for the period in which the royalty was earned 
revenue recognized pursuant to the robinson royalty agreement is based upon percent of revenue received by the operator of the mine  quadra  for the sale of minerals from the robinson mine  reduced by certain costs incurred by quadra 
quadra s concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters  in general  provide for an initial payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices at the date of shipment 
final true up payments are subsequently based upon final assays and market metal prices set on a specified future dates  typically one to three months after the date the concentrate arrives at the third party smelter which generally occurs three to six months after the shipment date from the robinson mine 
royal gold recognizes revenue under the robinson royalty agreement based on amounts contractually due pursuant to the calculations above for the underlying sale 
as a result of pricing variations in gold  silver and copper over the respective settlement period  royalty revenue recognized on the robinson royalty could be positively or negatively impacted by any changes in metal prices  between the provisional and final settlement periods 
liquidity and capital resources overview at june   we had current assets of million compared to current liabilities of million for a current ratio of to this compares to current assets of million and current liabilities of 
table of contents million at june   resulting in a current ratio of approximately to our available cash increased during the period primarily due to net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to our april equity offering  discussed below  of approximately million as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of royalty interests in mineral properties  including transaction costs  of approximately million during the period 
the decrease in the current ratio is due primarily to an increase in our accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payable is due to an increase in our nevada net proceeds tax nnpt payable  which is due to an increase in royalty revenue from our nevada properties during the first six months of calendar during the fiscal year ended june   liquidity needs were met from million in royalty revenues including million of minority interest  net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our april equity offering of approximately million  our available cash resources and interest and other income of million
