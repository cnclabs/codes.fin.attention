item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had only one operating segment our intellectual property business 
as we continue to acquire ip businesses  we expect to have three segments in the future retail franchising  consumer brand products  and quick service restaurants 
the businesses that we owned and operated in and have been sold 
as a result  their results have been reclassified to discontinued operations in our historical financial statements  and our continuing operations in and earlier years reflect only corporate expenses and other non operating items 
we own the proprietary rights to a number of trademarks used in this report which are important to our business  including the athlete s foot  bill blass  maggiemoo s and marble slab 
we have omitted the and tm trademark designations for such trademarks in this report 
nevertheless  all rights to such trademarks named in this report are reserved 
our business operations and strategy our operating strategy is to generate revenue from licensing and other commercial arrangements with third parties who want to use the ip that we acquire 
these third parties pay us licensing and other contractual fees and royalties for the right to use our ip on either an exclusive or non exclusive basis 
our contractual arrangements may apply to a specific demographic product market  a specific geographic market or to multiple demographics and or markets 
we expect that licensing and other contractual fees paid to us will include a mixture of upfront payments  required periodic minimum payments regardless of sales volumes  and volume dependent periodic royalties based upon the number or dollar amount of branded products and services sold 
accordingly  we expect that our revenues will reflect both recurring and non recurring payment streams 
we operate our ip business in what we call a value net business model 
this model does not require us to incur substantial operating or capital costs in running our business  as we do not and do not plan to manufacture  warehouse or distribute the branded products associated with the ip we acquire or build stores in the case of franchise operations 
we intend to rely on third party licensees and other business partners to incur such capital costs and perform such services 
however  we will generally be involved in the marketing  promotion and quality control of products and services that make use of our ip such as trademarks and trade names that we own  and we also may provide certain merchandising  purchasing and training support services with respect to franchise operations 
we believe that this business model mitigates or transfers to third parties the risks related to working capital ie inventory and receivables and capital expenditures 
we believe that this model allows us to maintain maximum operational and financial flexibility and positions us to succeed in today s competitive global economy 
as a result of our business model  we rely heavily on third parties  including licensees and franchisees  to make sales  generate revenues and help grow our business 
such reliance involves various risks and uncertainties  which are discussed below in item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of business we acquire 
we intend to leverage our brand management  marketing  and licensing expertise  costs and professionals across our three operating verticals 
we expect that these operating verticals will enable us to generate royalties at the wholesale and retail level on sales of goods for brands that we acquire  through distribution channels that we own  without the loss of sales in third party channels 
for example  we might decide to contract with third parties to produce a private label brand of socks that use our owned brand  the athlete s foot  for sale in our chain of the athlete s foot franchisee stores 
the manufacturer of the socks who sells the product to the franchisees would pay us a royalty on those sales and in turn the franchisees who sell the socks to their retail customers also would pay us a royalty on their sales 
the following graphic summarizes our three operating segments retail franchising  consumer branded products and qsr franchising and the opportunities to cross leverage the operating verticals with each other 
franchise concepts we purchase can be sold to our existing network of master franchisees who currently manage our franchise brands worldwide 
brands that we acquire can be sold through third party retail channels and channels that we own and control  allowing us to earn wholesale and retail royalties 
our objective is to create a flexible operating structure  control our distribution channels  and sell our owned brands through these channels as well as third party channels 
diversification and growth as we build a portfolio of ip centric businesses  we expect to operate a business model that is diversified in several ways across industries  ranging from apparel  footwear and sporting goods to qsr and retail franchising  across channels of distribution  ranging from luxury to mass market  across consumer demand categories  ranging from luxury to mass market  across licensees and franchisees  ranging from large licensees to individual franchisees  and across geographies both within the united states and internationally  and across multiple demographic groups 
we believe that this multi category diversification will help reduce potential volatility in our financial results given the varied sources of royalty payments from franchisees and licensees of different types and in different markets  demographics  and geographies and may mitigate impairment risk 
we believe that our business model offers a three tiered growth opportunity our businesses can grow both domestically and internationally through organic  and synergistic growth  our businesses can grow organically by expanding and extending owned brands into new product categories and retail channels  increasing brand awareness and executing new licenses or selling new franchises  we can grow through acquisition by acquiring new brands or additional franchise systems  and our business can grow synergystically by leveraging our three operating verticals 
we can grow acquired brands by enabling them to sell branded products through franchise systems that we own 
conversely  we can expand our franchise systems by allowing them to sell additional branded products that we own or acquire 
in either case  our objective will be to allow both our product brands and our systems to increase their sales 
in each case  we would collect additional retail and wholesale royalties 
development of our ip business and acquisition strategy we entered the ip business when we acquired ucc in june historically  ucc provided strategic advice and structured finance solutions to ip centric companies 
at the time that we acquired ucc  ucc s former president and chief executive officer  robert d loren  became our president and chief executive officer  as well as a member of our board of directors 
in september  we hired david b 
meister to become our new chief financial officer  and in december we hired charles zona to become our executive vice president  brand management and licensing 
other members of the ucc management team assumed management roles in our developing ip business  and at the end of we moved our corporate headquarters to new york city  where our ip business is based 
since june  we have acquired four ip centric companies 
we have also been and expect to continue to be in active discussions with other potential acquisition candidates 
our objective is to acquire to businesses or significant groups of ip assets per year  with transaction sizes generally in excess of million total enterprise value 
we maintain a highly disciplined pricing approach to acquisitions 
our objective is to acquire consumer branded products companies at transaction multiples that range from to times royalties 
for qsr franchise concepts  our target range is from to times revenues 
we believe this approach will enable us to make accretive acquisitions given our capital structure using a combination of cash on hand  shares of our common stock and borrowings under debt facilities

risk factors under the caption risks of our our current business any failure to meet our debt obligations would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
competition our brands are all subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign brands 
each of our brands has numerous competitors within each of our specific distribution channels 
our degree of success is dependent on the image of our brands to consumers and our licensees ability to design  manufacture and sell products bearing our brands 
in seeking to make acquisitions of ip and ip centric businesses  we compete with other companies and financial buyers such as private equity funds 
while we believe the number of competitors is currently limited  we expect that more competitors will develop over time 
competitors may be larger than us  have access to greater financial and other resources or be willing to pay higher prices in acquisitions or assume greater acquisition related risks 
see item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our acquisition strategy competition may negatively affect our ability to complete suitable acquisitions 
the athletes foot 
our franchisees operate in the retail athletic footwear and apparel business which is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry 
the principal competitive factors in these markets are price  quality  selection of merchandise  reputation  store location  advertising and customer service 
the businesses we acquired in  and businesses we acquire in the future  are also subject to competitive risks and pressures  including price  quality  selection of merchandise  reputation  store location  advertising and customer service 
historical operations historical overview until late  we owned  acquired and operated a number of mobile and wireless communications businesses 
these businesses never became profitable  and during we sold these businesses and started a mortgage backed securities  or mbs  business 
during and  we assembled a leveraged portfolio of mbs investments 
however  market conditions for the mbs business changed significantly during and into  and the profitability of our leveraged mbs portfolio declined 
in light of these changing market conditions  in late and into  we began to explore additional and alternative business strategies that we thought could help us become profitable more quickly and create shareholder value 
these efforts resulted in our decision to acquire ucc in june on october   at the annual meeting of stockholders the annual meeting  our stockholders approved the sale of our mbs portfolio for the purpose of discontinuing our mbs business and allocating all cash proceeds from such sale to the growth and development of our ip business 
we sold our mbs investments in november  and since that time  we have focused entirely on our ip business 
holding company reorganization and name change aether systems inc aether systems  the historical entity through which we previously conducted the mobile government  ems and transportation businesses  was formed in january on july   the stockholders of aether systems approved a holding company reorganization of aether systems in which each share of aether systems common stock was exchanged for one share of common stock of aether holdings  inc aether holdings  and aether systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of aether holdings 
the reorganization was undertaken to implement restrictions on certain changes in the ownership of our common stock in an effort to protect the long term value of our substantial net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards as described in further detail below 
in recognition of the changing business strategy of the company  on october   our stockholders approved a change of our company name from aether holdings to nexcen brands 
effective november   we changed our ticker symbol  under which our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market  from aeth to nexc 
tax loss carry forwards as a result of the substantial losses incurred by our mobile and wireless communications businesses through  as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that expire on various dates between and these tax loss carryforwards are generally available to offset federal income taxes 
we expect to remain subject to certain state  local  and foreign tax obligations  as well as to a portion of the federal alternative minimum tax  as discussed below in item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our tax loss carry forwards 
in addition  we had capital loss carry forwards of approximately million that expire between and if we had an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended irc  our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carry forwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase or decrease their aggregate percentage ownership by or more as compared to the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single stockholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one stockholder 
transactions in the public markets among stockholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
as a result of the holding company reorganization that we completed in  as described above under the caption holding company reorganization and name change  shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation 
in general  the transfer restrictions prohibit any person from acquiring or more of our stock without our consent 
persons who owned or more of our stock prior to may  are permitted to sell the shares owned as of may  without regard to the transfer restrictions 
shares acquired by such persons after may  are subject to the transfer restrictions 
while we expect that these transfer restrictions will help guard against a change of ownership occurring under section and the related rules  because we are using stock as consideration to make acquisitions  because we may decide or need to sell additional shares of our common stock in the future to raise capital for our business and because persons who held or more of our stock prior to these restrictions taking effect can sell and in some cases have sold shares of our stock  we cannot guarantee that these restrictions will prevent a change of ownership from occurring 
our board of directors also has the right to waive the application of these restrictions to any transfer 
one of our principal business objectives is to operate profitably so that we can realize value  in the form of tax savings  from our accumulated tax loss carry forwards 
the company monitors the change in shareholdings on a monthly basis and has an outside accounting firm other than our independent auditor perform a quarterly analysis to determine the cumulative percent change through the end of the particular quarter 
based upon a review of past changes in our ownership  as of december   we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change as defined under section that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards 
however  we can not be certain that the irs or some other taxing authority may not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change  which would severely limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
for a discussion on the risks associated with our tax loss carry forwards  please refer to item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our tax loss carry forwards 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

risk factors investing on our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider these risks as well as information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
risks of our current business we have incurred significant losses throughout our history and may not be profitable in the future 
since our inception  we have incurred net losses of approximately billion 
we only recently began to implement our new ip centric business strategy 
there is no assurance that we will be able to operate this new ip business profitably or to report net income in the future and realize the value of our substantial tax loss carryforwards 
our ip centric business is new  and we may not be successful in operating or expanding it 
we do not have an established history of acquiring ip  or ip centric businesses  and managing ip assets and businesses 
we began to implement our ip centric business in june  when we acquired ucc 
upon the closing of that acquisition  mr 
d loren  who was the president and chief executive officer of ucc  became our president and chief executive officer 
during their tenure with ucc  mr 
d loren and the other members of our senior management team were involved primarily in providing banking  finance  consulting and other advisory services to ip centric businesses 
they did not own or manage an ip centric business directly 
as a result  we may encounter unanticipated difficulties or challenges as we work to implement our new business strategy 
if we are unable to address and overcome such difficulties or challenges  we may not be successful with our new business strategy 
we are dependent upon our president and chief executive officer  robert w 
d loren 
if we lose mr 
d loren s services  we may not be able to successfully implement our ip business strategy 
the successful implementation of our ip business strategy will depend primarily upon the efforts of mr 
d loren  our president and chief executive officer 
mr 
d loren is the person primarily responsible for conceiving of and implementing our ip business strategy 
although we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
d loren that runs through june  there is no guarantee that he will remain employed by us throughout the period 
if he ceases to work with us  or if his services are reduced  we will need to identify and hire other qualified executives  and we may not be successful in finding or hiring adequate replacements 
this could impede our ability to fully implement our ip business strategy  which would harm our business and prospects 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and  among other things  make it more expensive for us to complete acquisitions using our stock as consideration 
since we announced the acquisition of ucc and the hiring of mr 
d loren  the trading price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility could reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could change significantly over short periods of time in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements by us or by third parties on whom we rely or against whom we compete  factors affecting the markets in which we do business or changes in national or regional economic conditions 
if our stock price declines  we may be required to issue additional shares to complete acquisitions  which would make them more dilutive to our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock also could be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies against whom we compete or companies in the industries in which our licensees compete 
we are unlikely to become profitable unless we can identify and acquire ip and ip centric businesses on favorable terms 
our ability to achieve our business objective of becoming profitable will depend on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms  so that we can increase our revenues and generate net income 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  our new ip business will be very limited and may not generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or that such transactions  if completed  will contribute positively to our operations and financial results and condition 
we are involved in litigation with respect to a business that we sold in in  we sold our mobile transportation business to geologic solutions  inc since that time  geologic has notified us of  and we have responded to  various indemnification claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties under the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold the transportation business to geologic 
we were unable to resolve these claims with geologic  and in march  geologic filed a lawsuit against us in state court in new york 
geologic s claims primarily involve allegations that we did not fully disclose certain aspects of our transportation business relationships with one of its major customers and two of its major suppliers that allegedly resulted in the devaluation of inventory and other adverse effects to the business 
geologic contends that it has suffered damages in excess of million as a result of these alleged breaches 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to geologic s claims and is vigorously defending against them 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  and an adverse resolution of such claims could require us to make a significant cash payment to geologic 
in such event  we would record a charge against earnings  further increasing the loss on the sale of the transportation business  and decreasing the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions and operations 
any failure to meet our debt obligations would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
on march   we entered into a new million master loan agreement with btmu capital corporation 
as of march   we have approximately million of long term debt outstanding  and expect to draw an additional million shortly to refinance the acquisitions of bill blass  maggiemoo s and marble slab 
interest rates for our master loan agreement vary based upon utilization and whether the borrowings are at the base rate or the london interbank offering rate libor 
our master loan agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for senior secured credit facilities  including  among other things  restrictions on indebtedness  liens  fundamental changes  loans  acquisitions  capital expenditures  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  common stock repurchases  dividends and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries and sale leaseback transactions 
our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under the indebtedness  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these restrictions may also limit our ability to operate our businesses and may prohibit or limit our ability to enhance our operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest  which will reduce the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business 
the master loan agreement may also limit our ability to obtain future financings which could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth 
the amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
risks of our acquisition strategy competition may negatively affect our ability to complete suitable acquisitions 
we believe that there are a limited number of other companies competing for acquisitions of the type that we are seeking 
however  we will face competition for acquisitions  and competition may increase as the business strategy we are pursuing continues to receive publicity 
existing and future competitors may be larger than us and have access to greater financial and other resources 
as a result  acquisitions may become more expensive  and we may face greater difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates on terms that we believe will make sense 
if we are unable to expand our business by completing acquisitions on favorable terms  our financial results may be negatively affected 
acquisitions involve numerous risks that we may not be able to address or overcome  and could result in acquisitions that negatively affect our business and financial results 
even if we are successful in completing ip centric acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that will justify our investments in those acquisitions 
among other things  we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  including various synergies and economies of scope and scale 
each acquisition involves numerous risks  any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and or the value of our equity 
these risks include  among others overpaying for acquired assets or businesses  being unable to license  market or otherwise exploit ip that we acquire on anticipated terms or at all  negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related expenses and amortization or impairment of acquired intangibles  diversion of management s attention from management of day to day operational issues  failing to maintain focus on  or ceasing to execute  core strategies and business plans as our ip portfolio grows and becomes more diversified  failing to acquire or hire additional successful managers  or being unable to retain critical acquired managers  potential adverse effects of a new acquisition on an existing business or business relationship  and underlying risks of the businesses that we acquire  which may differ from one acquisition to the next  including those related to entering new lines of business or markets in which we have little or no prior experience 
our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional ip assets and business will depend on the availability of capital to complete acquisitions 
we financed the acquisitions of the athlete s foot  bill blass  maggiemoo s and marble slab with a combination of cash and equity  and we intend to finance our future ip acquisitions through a combination of available cash  bank or other institutional financing  and issuances of equity and possibly debt securities 
as of march   we had approximately million of cash on hand after borrowing million under the new senior credit facility we entered into on march  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure borrowings in the future to fund acquisitions  either on terms that we consider reasonable or at all 
in addition  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  we face limitations on the number of shares of equity that we can issue without triggering limitations on our future ability to use our substantial accumulated tax loss carry forwards 
under certain circumstances  these limitations if triggered could significantly or  under certain circumstances  totally reduce the future value of our tax loss carry forwards assuming we are able to generate taxable income that would benefit from the use of the tax loss carry forwards 
as a result of these factors  we may lack access to sufficient capital to complete acquisitions that we identify and want to complete 
in such a case  our inability to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  our financial results and the trading price of our stock 
we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our athlete s foot franchisees operate in over countries 
in addition  the brands and other ip assets that we acquire and manage are currently used  and in the future are expected to be used  for products and services that will be advertised and sold in many different countries 
as a result 
we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities for our ip business outside the united states  which could expose us to greater risks 
the risks associated with our ip business outside the united states include political and economic instability or civil unrest  armed conflict  natural disasters or terrorism  health concerns or similar issues  such as a pandemic or epidemic  multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that differ between jurisdictions  changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements effecting trade and investment  differences from one country to the next in legal protections applicable to ip assets  including trademarks and similar assets  enforcement of such protections and remedies available for infringements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  and adverse consequences from changes in tax laws 
the effects of these risks  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse impact on our ip business 
risks of businesses we acquire our business will depend on market acceptance of the ip that we intend to acquire such as trademarks  brands and franchise rights 
we expect these markets to be highly competitive 
continued market acceptance of the ip that we intend to acquire  such as trademarks  brands and franchise rights is critical to our future success and subject to great uncertainty 
the consumer branded products industries on which we expect to focus our acquisition activities are extremely competitive  both in the united states and overseas 
accordingly  we expect that we and our future licensees and other business partners including franchisees will face intense and substantial competition with respect to marketing and expanding products and services under acquired ip 
as a result  we may not be able to attract licensees  franchisees and other business partners on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  licensees and other third parties with whom we deal may not be successful in selling products and services that make use of our acquired ip 
they and we also may not be able to expand the distribution of such products and services into new markets 
in general  competitive factors include quality  price  style  name recognition and service 
in addition  the presence in the marketplace of short lived fads and the limited availability of shelf space can affect competition for many consumer products 
changes in consumer tastes  national  regional and local economic conditions  discretionary spending priorities  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing products and outlets also can affect market results 
competing trademarks and brands may have the backing of companies with greater financial  distribution  marketing  capital and other resources than do us or our licensees and other business partners 
this may increase the obstacles that we and they face in competing successfully 
among other things  we may have to spend more on advertising and marketing or may need to reduce the amounts that we charge licensees and other business partners 
this could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
because we expect to rely on unaffiliated third parties to market  distribute  sell and in some cases design products and services using ip such as trademarks and brands that we license  the success of our business may depend upon various factors that are beyond our control 
we expect to have limited personnel and operations 
substantially all of our earnings are expected to come from royalties generated from licensees  franchisees and similar contractual relationships involving ip that we acquire 
licensees  franchisees and other business partners are independent operators  and we will not exercise day to day control over any of them 
as a result  our business will face a number of risks  including the following we expect that products using our ip will be manufactured by third party licensees  either directly or through third party manufacturers on a subcontract basis 
all manufacturers have limited production capacity  and the ones with whom we work directly or indirectly may not  in all instances  be able to satisfy manufacturing requirements for our and our licensees products 
we expect to provide limited training and support to franchisees 
consequently  franchisees may not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements  or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel 
while we will try to ensure that our licensees and other business partners maintain a high quality of products and services that use our ip  they may take actions that adversely affect the value of our ip or our business reputation 
our failure to protect proprietary rights that we acquire could decrease the value of those assets 
we expect to acquire a combination of trademarks  copyrights  franchise rights  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights 
the success of our ip business strategy will depend in part on our ability to license this intellectual property for use by third parties in selling various products and services and developing brand and product awareness in new geographic and product markets 
although we expect that much of our intellectual property will be protected by registration or other legal rules in the united states  in some cases registration may not be in place or available  particularly outside of the united states 
in some cases  third parties may be using similar trademarks or other intellectual property in certain countries  and we may not be able to use certain of our intellectual property in those countries 
we intend to monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized filings of registrations for our trademarks and other intellectual property and to rely primarily upon a combination of trademark  copyright  know how  trade secrets and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that such measures afford only limited protection and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that actions taken in the past  or that we take in the future  to establish and protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement by others  or prevent a loss of revenue or other damages 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may be required to spend significant time and money on protecting or defending our intellectual property rights 
we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce legal protections that we believe apply to intellectual property that we acquire  including to protect our trade secrets 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales  profitability and prospects  regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 
in addition  to the extent that any of the intellectual property we acquire is deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others  we could be prevented from using it  which could cause a termination of licensing and other commercial arrangements 
this would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 
we also could be required to defend litigation brought against us  which can be costly and time consuming 
it could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us 
the acquisition of ip assets and ip centric businesses will result in us recording a material amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet 
if we are required to write down a portion of this goodwill and other intangible assets  our financial results would be adversely affected 
as a result of our acquisition strategy  certain identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives which meet specified accounting criteria will consist of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
we will not amortize goodwill 
we may not be able to realize the full fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill from our acquisitions 
we will evaluate on at least an annual basis whether all or a portion of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired 
any write down of intangible assets or goodwill resulting from future periodic evaluations would decrease our net income  and those decreases could be material 
material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the businesses we acquire could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
the integration of acquisitions includes ensuring that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting effectively apply to and address the operations of newly acquired businesses 
while we will make every effort to thoroughly understand any acquired entity s business processes  our planning for proper integration into our company can give no assurance that we will not encounter operational and financial reporting difficulties impacting our controls and procedures 
as a result  we may be required to change our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting to accommodate newly acquired operations  and we may also be required to remediate historic weaknesses or deficiencies at acquired businesses 
our review and evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls of the companies we acquire may take time and require additional expense  and if they are not effective on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and the market s perception of our company 
risks of our tax loss carry forwards we may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that expire between and in addition  we had capital loss carry forwards of approximately million that expire between and if we had an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code  our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
based upon a review of past changes in our ownership  as of december   we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change as defined under section that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these net operating loss and capital loss carry forwards 
however  we can not assure you that the irs or some other taxing authority may not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change  which would severely limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase or decrease their aggregate percentage ownership by or more as compared to the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single stockholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one stockholder 
transactions in the public markets among stockholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
on july   our stockholders approved a holding company reorganization in which each share of what was then aether systems common stock was exchanged for one share of common stock of a new holding company then called aether holdings  and now called nexcen brands 
as a result of this transaction  shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation 
in general  the transfer restrictions prohibit any person from acquiring more than of our stock without our consent 
persons who owned or more of our stock prior to may  are permitted to sell the shares owned as of may  without regard to the transfer restrictions 
shares acquired by such persons after may  are subject to the transfer restrictions 
while we expect that these transfer restrictions will help guard against an ownership change occurring under section and the related rules  because we are using stock as consideration to make acquisitions  and because we may decide or need to sell additional shares of our common stock in the future to raise capital for our business and because persons who held more than of our stock prior to these restrictions taking effect can sell and in some cases have sold shares of our stock  we cannot guarantee that these restrictions will prevent a change of ownership from occurring 
we may not be able to use our tax loss carry forwards because we may not generate taxable income 
the use of our net operating loss carry forwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate 
similarly  the extent of our actual use of our capital loss carry forwards is also subject to uncertainty because their use depends on the amount of capital gains we generate 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income or capital gains in future years to use the net operating loss carry forwards or capital loss carry forwards before they expire 
this is especially true for our capital loss carry forwards  because they expire over a shorter period of time than our net operating loss carry forwards 
the irs could challenge the amount of our tax loss carry forwards 
the amount of our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the irs 
the irs could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards  which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes 
in addition  calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty  both because of the complexity and ambiguity of section and because of limitations on a publicly traded company s knowledge as to the ownership of  and transactions in  its securities 
therefore  we cannot assure you that the calculation of the amount of our net loss carry forwards may not be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of  and transactions in  our securities 
we expect to be subject to state  local and foreign taxes  as well as the alternative minimum tax 
our net loss carry forwards would not offset the alternative minimum tax in its entirety 
we will continue to be subject to state  local and foreign taxes 
as a result of our capital loss carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards  we anticipate our federal income tax liability over the next several years will be reduced substantially 
however  we expect to be subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the internal revenue code which limits the use of net operating loss carry forwards 
these provisions would result  in effect  in of our alternative minimum taxable income being subject to the alternative minimum tax assessed on corporations 
this amounts to a effective tax rate on our alternative minimum taxable income 
the irs may seek to impose the accumulated earnings tax on some or all of the taxable income we retain 
we expect to retain all or a substantial portion of future earnings over the next several years to finance the development and growth of our ip business 
as a result  we may not declare or pay any significant dividends on shares of our common stock for an extended period 
if the irs believed we were accumulating earnings beyond our reasonable business needs  the irs could seek to impose an accumulated earnings tax  or aet  of on our accumulated taxable income 
we do not believe that we will be subject to the aet due to various reasons  including the existence of our large deficit in accumulated earnings and profits 
however  the irs may disagree with us on this point  and the irs may attempt to impose the aet on all or a portion of our taxable income 
in such event  we would expect to challenge any attempt by the irs to impose the aet on our business  but the outcome of such a challenge is uncertain 
if we distributed our accumulated taxable income for each year to our stockholders as dividends  we would not be subject to the aet for the amounts so distributed  but would be subject to the aet only for the amount of earnings retained 
if we paid dividends to stockholders out of current earnings  these dividends would  generally speaking  be eligible to be treated as qualified dividends for federal income tax purposes  taxed at the current maximum federal rate of  assuming that the recipient stockholder met the various requirements under the internal revenue code for such treatment 
the maximum rate for qualified dividends is currently projected to increase to the maximum federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income currently for tax years beginning after december  in accordance with the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of limits on ownership of our common stock could have an adverse consequence to you and could limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock 
as noted above  it is important that we avoid an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code  in order to retain the ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards to offset future income 
under transfer restrictions that have been applicable to our common stock since  no one is permitted to acquire or more of our stock without the consent of our board of directors 
in addition  even if our board of directors consented to a significant stock acquisition  a potential buyer might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward  because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income 
thus  this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control and  therefore  could affect adversely our shareholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control 
the transfer restrictions that apply to shares of our common stock  although designed as a protective measure to avoid an ownership change  may have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if such a transaction may be favorable to the interests of some or all of our shareholders 
this effect might prevent our stockholders from realizing an opportunity to sell all or a portion of their common stock at a premium to the prevailing market price

item properties as of december   we leased a total of approximately  square feet of office space 
our principal offices total  square feet and are located in new york  ny 
the athlete s foot office is located in norcross  ga and totals  square feet of leased office space 
in addition  we maintain a lease for space in marlborough  massachusetts that we used for the mobile government business that we sold in we have sublet this office space to bio key international  inc  the company that purchased the mobile government business bio key 
we believe that our retained facilities are adequate for the purposes for which they are presently used and that replacement facilities are available at comparable cost  should the need arise 
as we acquire additional businesses  we expect to own or lease additional office space 
such additions may come through assuming leases of businesses we acquire  purchasing property owned by acquired businesses as part of the acquisitions  or entering into new leases either to consolidate operations in multiple locations or to accommodate the needs of our business as it expands

item legal proceedings ipo litigation 
nexcen is among the hundreds of defendants named in a series of class action lawsuits seeking damages due to alleged violations of securities law 
the case is being heard in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the court has consolidated the actions by all of the named defendants that actually issued the securities in question 
there are approximately consolidated cases before judge scheindlin  including this action  under the caption in re initial public offerings litigation  master file mc sas 
as to nexcen  these actions were filed on behalf of persons and entities that acquired the company s stock after its initial public offering in october  among other things  the complaints claim that prospectuses  dated october  and september  and issued by nexcen in connection with the public offerings of common stock  allegedly contained untrue statements of material fact or omissions of material fact in violation of securities laws because the prospectuses allegedly failed to disclose that the offerings underwriters had solicited and received additional and excessive fees  commissions and benefits beyond those listed in the arrangements with certain of their customers which were designed to maintain  distort and or inflate the market price of the company s common stock in the aftermarket 
the actions seek unspecified monetary damages and rescission 
nexcen believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously contesting these actions 
after initial procedural motions and the start of discovery in and  the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the officer and director defendants of each of the named issuers  including nexcen 
then in june  the plaintiff s executive committee announced a proposed settlement with the issuer defendants  including nexcen  and the officer and director defendants of the issuers the issuer settlement 
a settlement agreement was signed in and presented to the district court for approval 
the proposed issuer settlement does not include the underwriter defendants  and they have continued to defend the actions and have objected to the proposed settlement 
one of the defendant underwriters signed a memorandum of understanding in april agreeing to a million settlement of claims against it 
under terms of the proposed issuer settlement  nexcen has a reserve of  for its estimated exposure 
if the proposed settlement is approved by the court  it is extremely unlikely that nexcen would incur any material financial or other liability 
the district court granted preliminary approval of the proposed issuer settlement in and held a fairness hearing on the matter in april in december  before final action by the district court on the proposed issuer settlement  the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued a ruling vacating class certification for certain plaintiffs in the actions against the underwriter defendants 
a petition was filed in early seeking rehearing of this decision  but the second circuit had not acted on the petition as of march  the impact of this decision on the claims against the issuer defendants including nexcen and on the proposed issuer settlement is unclear 
since december  the district court has stayed all proceedings in these cases pending further action by the second circuit 
transportation business sale 
on march   a complaint captioned geologic solutions  inc v 
aether holdings  inc 
was filed against the company in the supreme court for the state of new york  new york county 
the complaint generally alleges that plaintiff geologic was damaged as a result of certain alleged breaches of contract and fraudulent inducement arising out of nexcen s alleged misrepresentations and failure to disclose certain information in connection with the asset purchase agreement dated as of july  for the purchase and sale of our transportation business 
the allegations in geologic s complaint are substantially similar to claims geologic made in a previous request to the company for indemnification 
the complaint seeks monetary damages in an amount not less than million and other relief 
during the second quarter of  the plaintiff agreed to substitute aether systems  inc for aether holdings  inc as defendant in the case because aether systems  inc 
was the party to the asset purchase agreement upon which geologic s claims are based 
we believe we have a meritorious defense to geologic s claims and are vigorously defending against this action  however  we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  and an adverse resolution of such claims could require us to make a significant cash payment to geologic 
we have incurred costs in connection with the defense of this lawsuit  which have been recorded against discontinued operations  further increasing the loss on the sale of the transportation segment  and decreasing the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions and operations

in this discussion and analysis  we explain our financial condition and results of operations 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows we provide an introduction to our financial results and condition 
we discuss our critical accounting policies 
we discuss recent accounting pronouncements 
we discuss the results of our continuing operations for the year ended december   compared with results for the years ended december  and we discuss our financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and our contractual obligations 
introduction our business has undergone significant change  and consequently our financial results and condition are difficult to compare from one year to the next 
as discussed in item  our business has changed to an ip centric strategy 
when we talk about our continuing operations  we are referring to our ip business 
the results of our prior businesses our mbs business and our mobile and wireless data businesses are reported in discontinued operations 
because our ip business is relatively new and because we are building this business initially through acquisitions  each acquisition has a material impact on our financial results and condition 
this makes period to period comparisons even more difficult 
over time  as our group of owned businesses expands  we expect that additional acquisitions other than very significant acquisitions will have a less material impact on our results  and period to period comparisons will become more meaningful 
in reviewing our financial results and condition for the  and fiscal years  you should keep in mind the following factors with respect to our continuing operations we did not earn franchise or royalty revenues before november  when we acquired the athlete s foot 
accordingly  our results reflect just seven weeks of revenue from the athlete s foot business 
our results do not reflect any other revenue for or any prior years  because revenues from our prior businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
our operating expenses reflect the expenses of our ip business and all other expenses that were not directly attributable to the businesses now included in discontinued operations 
this includes the costs of our corporate staff 
accordingly  while results of our continuing operations reflect revenues for only a small portion of  they include significant operating expenses for all of and prior years 
we acquired ucc in june since that time  ucc has focused on pursuing acquisition and financing opportunities for our ip business 
ucc has not generated revenue since we acquired it  but we have incurred the operating expenses associated with the ucc business as part of the cost of developing our ip business 
we cannot predict whether ucc will generate revenue in the future from providing advice to third parties  as this is not the focus of our business strategy 
the reported loan servicing revenue at ucc of  in was recorded in other income because it is not the focus of our new ip business 
our financial results and condition for and prior years do not include any of the revenues  expenses  assets or liabilities of bill blass  maggiemoo s or marble slab  as we acquired these businesses in february our results will include the results and condition of these businesses  although they will only be included in our first quarter results for less than half of that quarter 
if we acquire additional businesses in  our results will include those businesses only from and after the date on which we acquire them 
we have been focused primarily on acquisitions  and are only beginning to focus on the development of acquired businesses 
beginning in  we expect to devote substantial attention to integrating our acquired businesses and pursuing organic growth opportunities through both franchising and licensing arrangements 
while we do not expect such activities to require us to incur material additional expenses  we cannot predict when they will result in incremental revenue 
our operating expenses are increasing as we add personnel and facilities to support our growing business 
these additions are coming both through our acquisitions and through hirings we make to add needed skills or to expand our staff so that we can properly manage and develop our business 
in and  we reduced our operating expenses significantly as we sold businesses and then managed a mortgage backed securities business that did not require an extensive staff 
in  we reversed this trend  as we began to grow our ip business  and we expect the operating expenses will continue to increase in the near term as we build our ip business 
however  we expect that our value net business model will enable us to operate efficiently and to leverage our people and facilities across a broad base of operations  thereby mitigating the rate of increase 
our balance sheet has changed significantly  and we expect that it will continue to change significantly in the near term 
during  we sold all of our mbs investments for cash and used a substantial portion of the cash proceeds to repay indebtedness under repurchase agreements and to fund a portion of the purchase prices of ucc and the athlete s foot as well as to fund our operating losses 
with these acquisitions  we acquired substantial ip assets and goodwill  as well as a limited amount of other assets and liabilities 
with additional acquisitions  we will be using cash to pay a portion of the purchase price and we will be acquiring assets  particularly trademarks and goodwill  and assuming or incurring various operating liabilities associated with the acquired businesses 
in addition  we will be incurring indebtedness under our new credit facility to finance a portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions 
we expect to borrow approximately million under the new credit facility to finance a portion of the purchase prices of our acquisitions of the athlete s foot  bill blass  maggiemoo s and marble slab 
we continue to earn interest on our cash balances 
in  we will begin to pay interest on our borrowings under our new credit facility 
interest income and interest expense will be reported as part of non operating income on our statement of operations 
the number of shares we have outstanding has continued to increase as we use our capital stock as consideration for acquisitions 
we also have granted a significant number of new stock options and have issued several warrants to purchase common stock in connection with acquisitions and as long term incentives for newly hired executives and other key personnel both in connection with acquisitions and as part of our efforts to build our management team as we expand our business 
we expect to continue to issue stock as consideration for acquisitions and possibly to raise additional capital for our business  subject to limitations under laws and rules that could affect our future use of our tax loss carry forwards 
these limitations are discussed above in item business under the caption tax loss carry forwards and also in item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our tax loss carry forwards 
in view of these various factors  we expect that our financial results in will differ significantly from our results in  and our financial condition also will continue to change as we expand our operations and complete acquisitions 
as described above in item business under the caption our business operations and strategy  our strategy is to generate revenue from licensing and other commercial arrangements with third parties who want to use the ip that we acquire 
these third parties including franchisees pay us licensing and other contractual fees and royalties for the right to use our ip on either an exclusive or non exclusive basis 
our contractual arrangements may apply to a specific product market  a specific geographic market  or to multiple markets 
our revenue represents a relatively small percentage of the revenue of our licensees and franchisees typically a royalty 
our revenue will depend upon our ability to negotiate successful licensing and franchising arrangements for our acquired brands  our ability to expand our franchised business and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to sell products and services that make use of our ip which will entitle us to receive fees and royalties from them 
as a result of our ip business strategy  we expect that our principal assets will be intangible assets the trademarks and other ip assets and associated goodwill related to the brands and businesses that we acquire  manage and develop and our people 
we do not expect to have substantial tangible assets  as our business model is not designed to require significant capital investment in tangible assets 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the net results of our mbs and our mobile and wireless communications businesses 
during  in three separate transactions we sold our mobile and wireless data businesses  which were organized into three operating segments ems  transportation and mobile government 
the aggregate sale price for these three businesses was million in cash 
in november  we exited the mbs business by selling our remaining million of mbs and recognized a gain of  earlier in  we sold million of our mbs investments and used the proceeds primarily to repay indebtedness under repurchase agreements that had been incurred to purchase mbs 
the net results of our discontinued operations include only those expenses directly attributable to the businesses that have been sold and do not include any of the costs of our corporate staff or offices  including the costs of being a public company 
these results were materially affected by impairment charges that we recognized in relating to the mobile and wireless data businesses and relating to the mbs business during  we reassessed the value of goodwill  intangible and certain other assets of our transportation and mobile government operations and ultimately recorded aggregate impairment charges of million during these impairment charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations in during  as a result of changes in our business strategy  we decided that unrealized losses in our mbs portfolio at december  should be considered other than temporary impairments under statement of accounting standards and needed to be charged against operating results as of that date 
as a result  we recognized the unrealized loss of approximately million and wrote off the unamortized premium of million  for a total other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million 
these charges are included in the profit from discontinued operations in during  we exited the mbs business and recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of of approximately  related to the sale of our remaining mbs investments 
reported gain or loss on the sale of these businesses includes the impact of the impairment charges 
for a discussion of potential post sale contingencies related to the transportation and mobile government businesses that could have an impact on our future financial results and condition see item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our current business we are involved in litigation with respect to a business that we sold in and note to consolidated financial statements 
other than these contingencies and costs that we incur in connection with efforts to resolve them  all of which would be reported as adjustments to gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations  we do not expect that discontinued operations will have any impact on our future results or financial condition 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies affect the amount of income and expense we record in each period as well as the value of our assets and liabilities and our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities 
in applying these critical accounting policies  we must make estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements that  if made differently  could have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and appropriate  in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
however  estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies  which the securities and exchange commission defines as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because management must make estimates about uncertain and changing matters 
valuation of deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets as a result of years of accumulated tax loss carry forwards 
management believes we will achieve profitable operations in future years that may enable us to recover the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
however  we presently do not have sufficient objective evidence to support management s belief and  accordingly  we maintain a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as required by us generally accepted accounting principles 
valuation of trademarks  goodwill and intangible assets trademarks represent the present value of future royalty income associated with the ownership of each trademark 
the company expects its trademarks to contribute to cash flows indefinitely  and therefore will not amortize any trademarks unless their useful life is no longer deemed indefinite 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not amortized 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently as required in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we will evaluate the fair value of trademarks and goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or other circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we will evaluate the fair value of trademarks and goodwill at the reporting segment level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections 
assumptions to be used in these projections  such as forecasted growth rates  cost of capital and multiples to determine the terminal value of the reporting segments  will be consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we will record an impairment loss when the implied fair value of the trademarks and goodwill assigned to the reporting segment is less than the carrying value of the reporting segment  including trademarks and goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets which include our intangible assets with determinable useful lives may be impaired  we will perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
these events or circumstances may include  but are not limited to  projected cash flows which are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows  a significant loss of management contracts without a realistic expectation of a replacement  and economic events which could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business patterns 
in our analysis  to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value  we will make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset will be written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss will be recognized 
goodwill and trademarks acquired in a purchase business combination which are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
we believe our business model enables us to leverage our brand management  marketing  and licensing expertise  costs and professionals across our three operating verticals  increasing the value of each brand 
we evaluate the estimated lives of our identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period 
recent accounting pronouncments in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin establishes that the financial statement effects of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in september  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  was issued 
sab expresses the staff s view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the interpretation provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the cumulative effects of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year  and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of the retained earnings for that year 
the disclosures should include the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment  when and how each error being corrected arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial 
the guidance of sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sab has not had an impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which applies to any other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants 
the new standard also provides guidance on the methods used to measure fair value and requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements 
sfas no

results of continuing operations loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations of million in increased million  or in from a loss of million in the increase in the amount of the loss primarily reflects increases in selling  general and administrative costs and stock based compensation following the acquisition of ucc and increased restructuring charges related to the relocation of our headquarters from baltimore  maryland to new york city  partially offset by million of royalty and franchise revenues and increases in interest income and other income 
as discussed above  we recorded revenue for only seven weeks of after the november  acquisition of the athlete s foot  while we incurred expenses for the entire year and also incurred expenses associated with the process of transitioning to a new senior management team following the completion of the ucc acquisition 
loss from continuing operations of million in decreased million  or in from a loss of million in the reduction in the amount of the loss primarily reflects decreased operating costs in following the sale of our ems  transportation and mobile government businesses in  interest expense from subordinated notes of million in  an investment loss of million in  and a loss on the early extinguishment of the subordinated notes of million in royalty and franchise fee revenue the company began recognizing royalty and franchise fee revenues following the acquisition of the athlete s foot in november  and we recognized million through the end of the fiscal year 
royalty revenues are recorded as they are earned and become receivable from franchisees 
franchise fee revenue is recognized when all initial services are performed  which is considered to be upon the opening of the applicable franchisee store 
as discussed above  all revenues from the mbs and the mobile and wireless communications businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations and are included in profit loss from discontinued operations 
total operating expenses operating expenses of million in increased million  or in from million in the increase primarily reflects an increase in selling  general and administrative costs and stock based compensation following the acquisition of ucc  and increased restructuring charges related to the relocation of our headquarters from baltimore  maryland to new york city and the transition of our senior management team 
operating expenses of million in decreased million  or in from million in the reduction primarily reflects decreased operating costs in following the sale of our ems  transportation and mobile government businesses in as we reduced our expenses consistent with the lower cost mbs business we were operating at the time 
operating expenses that are reclassed to discontinued operations were those directly attributable to businesses that have been sold 
all other costs are corporate expenses that would have been incurred regardless of our business operations  and therefore remain included as part of continuing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related costs  rent  facility related support costs  travel and advertising 
sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase primarily reflects additional costs resulting from our acquisitions of ucc and the athlete s foot 
excluding these acquisitions  sg a expenses would have decreased million 
the primary drivers of the increase relate to personnel related costs at ucc and the athlete s foot which were not owned in the personnel hired through the ucc acquisition comprise our new executive and management team  and the majority of our corporate staff 
sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decline reflects primarily the results of streamlining our corporate infrastructure to align it with the needs of our former mbs business following the sale of our mobile and wireless data businesses 
of the decrease  approximately million was related to personnel reductions 
professional fees professional fees of   and  in  and  respectively  consist of the costs of outside professionals  primarily related to legal expense associated with our public reporting  disposition  compliance and corporate finance activities and accounting fees related to auditing and tax services 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expenses arise from property and equipment purchased for use in our operations 
amortization costs arise from intangible assets acquired in acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  to  in from  in the increase primarily reflects the revision of estimated useful lives and the resulting accelerated depreciation of assets that were located in our baltimore headquarters and were taken out of service with the closing of that office  amortization of an intangible asset related to a non compete agreement with our chief executive officer  and amortization of intangibles of franchise agreements and master development agreements related to the athlete s foot acquisition 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to  in from million in the decrease reflects primarily the impact of our transition from our mobile and wireless data businesses to our mbs business including the associated streamlining of our corporate infrastructure 
this included disposing of fixed assets that were no longer needed to support our continuing operations 
stock compensation expense we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment in the first quarter of at that time we began to recognize compensation expense over the service period for the fair value of all equity based award grants issued after january   as well as expense attributable to the remaining service period for all prior grants that had not fully vested by that date 
stock compensation expense of million in reflects the adoption of sfas no 
r  and the granting of  options and warrants to purchase shares upon their becoming exercisable 
these options and warrants were issued to provide long term incentive packages to new key executives and other senior managers that we hired in  including individuals who were employed by ucc and the athlete s foot prior to their acquisition by us 
stock compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively  represents the cost associated with the grants of restricted stock and decreased approximately  from to the decreases result primarily from the reduction of our work force and the vesting of restricted stock grants 
in and  stock compensation expense was recorded using the intrinsic value based method 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest income interest income increased million or to million in from million in interest income decreased million or to million in from million in the higher amounts in and reflect interest received on higher cash balances invested in securities other than mbs 
these were primarily investments in us government securities with maturities of less than months 
in  substantially all available cash was invested in mbs and related securities 
the interest income net of interest expense and amortization of premiums from such investments approximately million was originally reported as revenue from our mbs business and is now included in results of discontinued operations 
total interest income in  including the net amount earned on mbs investments  was million 
interest expense on subordinated notes in october  we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
prior to that time  we incurred interest expense on these subordinated notes which decreased by million from to because of the redemption of the subordinated notes in october no further interest expense was incurred after the redemption of the notes 
when we redeemed all of our then outstanding convertible subordinated notes at a price of in accordance with the terms of those notes  we realized a million loss  which consisted of a million premium on the redemption and the recognition of approximately  in unamortized deferred financing costs 
the early retirement of the debt resulted in a savings of million in interest expense on the notes that we would have been required to pay through their maturity in march other income expense other income of  in primarily reflects  of payments received from a venture capital investment  which we wrote off in we record these payments when we receive them as the extent of future payments  if any  cannot be readily determined 
we also recorded  of loan servicing revenue received by ucc in we expect the loan servicing activity to decrease in and beyond as the underlying loans are paid off 
other income in of  primarily represents income from the sale of fully depreciated fixed assets such as computer equipment and furniture that were taken out of service during our restructuring efforts associated with the transition to our mbs business 
in september  we received a royalty payment of  relating to a prior investment in a company that we acquired in other expense for was approximately  primarily attributable to the cost of a litigation settlement 
investment loss investment loss was  in reflected losses realized upon the sale of all of the remaining long term investments we had in that were not related to our mbs portfolio 
the investment loss in consisted of a million loss on the liquidation of our investments available for sale consisting of highly liquid us government agency sponsored securities 
the loss was partially offset by a gain of million relating to the sale of other investments 
income taxes we recorded a current income tax expense in of  as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  we are required to record a deferred tax liability with respect to acquired intangible assets principally the athlete s foot trademark that are amortized for tax purposes over a definite life but not amortized under gaap because they are classified as indefinite life assets 
under gaap we are not able to offset this liability in our financial statements with a portion of the deferred tax asset created by our accumulated net tax loss carry forwards until such time as we have satisfied gaap requirements that there be objective evidence of our ability to generate sustainable profitability from our operations 
as we have a history of losses  we have not satisfied this requirement at december  even if we are able to report net income in and beyond  we may not satisfy this accounting requirement over the next several quarters and perhaps longer 
as a result  we are likely to continue to record a deferred tax expense in our statement of operations for at least a portion of this income tax expense is not a cash expense  but is a gaap requirement to record 
we are able to use our accumulated net tax loss carry forwards in preparing our tax returns to reduce our current cash tax obligations 
when we are permitted  under gaap  to offset the deferred tax liability against the deferred tax asset resulting from our accumulated tax loss carry forwards  we will do so 
as discussed in item business under the caption tax loss carry forwards  our net tax loss carry forwards will not offset all state  local and foreign tax liabilities  and we also will remain subject to alternative minimum taxes  as discussed in item a 
risk factors under the caption risks of our tax loss carry forwards we expect to be subject in the alternative minimum tax and our net loss carry forwards would not offset this tax in its entirety 
our state  local and foreign tax position is discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  and the  expense for reflects the net amount of current state  local and foreign taxes payable 
our continuing operations were not subject to any alternative minimum tax in our net loss from discontinued operations included a net tax expense of  in  as compared to in and  in this was attributable to the application of the alternative minimum tax 
if our continuing operations generate taxable income in the future  we expect to record current tax liabilities for state  local  foreign and federal alternative minimum taxes  as our net tax loss carry forwards will not offset such tax liabilities in their entirety 
we cannot yet estimate the effective tax rate that would result from these taxes  though we expect them to result in a modest overall effective tax rate 
discontinued operations the following discrete events impact the comparability of discontinued operations from year to year during  the company exited the mbs business 
the company recognized a gain in the fourth quarter of of approximately  related to the sale of its remaining mbs investments 
management determined that unrealized losses in the mbs portfolio at december  should be considered other than temporary impairments under statement of accounting standards and were charged against operating results as of that date 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized the unrealized loss of approximately million and wrote off the unamortized premium of million for the total other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million 
prior to that time  management had considered such unrealized losses as not other than temporary and had recorded such losses in other comprehensive losses on the company s balance sheet 
in  we sold our mobile and wireless data businesses  which were organized into three operating segments 
in january  we sold our ems segment for million in cash and a million note which was paid in full in august 
in september we sold our transportation and mobile government businesses for million in cash and million in cash  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government goodwill and recorded impairment charges related to goodwill of million and million  respectively 
these impairments are reflected in discontinued operations 
during  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government intangibles and other long lived assets and recorded non cash impairment charges related to transportation intangibles and other assets of million and million  respectively and reported as discontinued operations 
financial condition during  our total assets decreased by million  while our total liabilities decreased by million 
these changes reflect principally the sale of our mbs investments and the repayment of all borrowings pursuant to short term repurchase agreements that were incurred to purchase mbs 
at december   our mbs portfolio totaled million net of the charges discussed above under the heading introduction  and our short term  mbs related borrowings totaled million 
we sold all of our mbs for cash during and used a substantial portion of the proceeds to repay all of the outstanding short term borrowings  and to fund a portion of the purchase price of the athlete s foot and our operating costs 
we had no outstanding borrowings at december  the balance of the proceeds from the sale of our mbs is held as cash and cash equivalents and is invested as discussed below in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our cash balance also increased by approximately million as a result of the expiration of a letter of credit that had been collateralized by a cash deposit which was released at the time of expiration 
that cash collateral had been reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash at december  the other additional significant change in our balance sheet at december  as compared to december  is the addition of million of trademarks and goodwill resulting from the ucc and the athlete s foot acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
sources of liquidity can include cash generated by operations  available borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of securities or assets 
our operations have not been profitable historically  and thus they have consumed  rather than generated  cash 
one of our key objectives is to achieve profitability in our ip business  so that our operations will enhance our liquidity and increase the amount of cash we have available for investment in the growth and development of our business 
our business model does not involve significant capital asset investment other than planned acquisitions of ip assets and ip centric businesses 
accordingly  we do not expect to be required to fund any material capital expenditures outside of our core ip acquisition program 
although we had more than million of cash on hand at december   we concluded that securing an additional source of liquidity was important to ensure our continued ability to fund acquisitions and the expansion of our business 
accordingly  on march  we entered into a new million bank credit facility  the terms of which are discussed below 
we believe that the combination of cash on hand and available borrowings under this new credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet current operations and planned business growth for at least the next twelve months 
additional sources of liquidity  if needed  may be available through additional bank borrowings and market sales or private placements of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that any such additional borrowings or sales of securities will be available to us should they be needed in the future on favorable terms and conditions or at all 
such sources of additional liquidity are subject to many risks and uncertainties that are not within our control  such as changes in the condition of the capital markets and prevailing bank loan terms  as well as the trading price of our common stock 
see item a 
risk factors under the captions risk of our current business the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and  among other things  make it more expensive for us to complete acquisitions using our stock as consideration and risks of our acquisition strategy our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional ip assets and business will depend on the availability of capital to complete acquisitions for a discussion of risks relating to our ability to fund additional acquisitions 
on march   nexcen acquisition corp 
the issuer entered into a master loan agreement with btmu capital corporation 
this master loan agreement provides for borrowings pursuant to the issuance of a single class of notes to the issuer and its wholly owned subsidiaries co issuers which are jointly and severally liable for payments required under the notes 
the assets of the issuers and co issuers are pledged as collateral security under each note  and secure the obligations of the issuer and all co issuers under all of the notes 
the notes are non recourse to the company 
the pledged assets are those of the issuer and co issuers mainly ip assets and the related royalties 
each note is repayable in full after five years 
the facility has no expiration date and can be terminated by the co issuers upon days notice and by btmu capital corportaion by electing not to fund future advances  however  each note funding maintains its respective maturity date 
the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings that may be outstanding at any one time under the agreement is million 
the borrowing rate is libor plus an interest rate margin  which ranges from to 
the company may refinance all or part of the notes with no pre payment penalties 
this allows us to refresh available borrowing capacity under the facility  such as by completing securitization transactions involving certain of our acquired ip assets and using the proceeds from these transactions to repay notes under the master loan agreement 
the borrowing rate is based on month libor which is a floating rate 
the libor rate resets every days 
the following table reflects use of net cash for operations  investing  and financing activities in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was  in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and used in operating activities of million for and  respectively 
historically  our operations have not been profitable 
in  due to a substantial reduction in operating expenses  the operating activities from our mbs business provided net cash in as discussed above under the heading introduction  our ip business did not generate any royalty and franchise fee revenue until november  when we acquired the athlete s foot 
however  we incurred operating expenses throughout all of  as we transitioned our of the mbs business and into our ip business 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily reflecting million of mbs sales and principal repayments  partially offset by million of cash used in the acquisitions of ucc and the athlete s foot 
cash used in investing activities of million for  primarily related to million used to purchase mbs  partially offset by million of principal repayments on our mbs and proceeds from the sale of million of mbs 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  consisting primarily of a net amount of million from the purchase and sale of investments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities 
additionally  we used million to purchase mbs and received approximately million  million  and million from the sale of our ems  transportation and mobile government businesses  respectively  net of transaction expenses  and received million in net proceeds from the sale of other investments 
net cash used in financing activities in of million primarily reflects the repayment of short term repurchase agreements that were used to fund mbs investments 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million which primarily related to the funding we received through repurchase agreements to purchase mbs 
net cash used in financing activities of million for  consisting primarily of million used to redeem the remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
we also received approximately million of cash upon the release of collateral relating to certain letters of credit that expired in our financial condition may also be affected by claims relating to the mobile and wireless data businesses that we sold during under the definitive purchase agreements that we signed to affect those sales  we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of those businesses for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we provided to them with respect to the sales of the businesses 
in addition  we remain liable for the operation of each of the business segments prior to their dispositions 
in addition  as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  we have resolved one dispute with geologic  the buyer of our transportation business  and have been notified by geologic of additional significant potential indemnity claims against us 
this lawsuit also is discussed above in item legal proceedings 
we have not received any indemnity claims from the buyers of our other two mobile and wireless data businesses  and most of the indemnification provisions relating to the sale of our ems business have now expired 
most of the indemnification provisions relating to the other two businesses will continue through the first quarter of contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual commitments  including our future minimum lease payments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrants balance sheet under gaap total the operating lease obligations reflect real estate leases in new york city  norcross  georgia  and marlborough  massachusetts which we sub lease 
the purchase obligation reflects the company s million agreement related to the bill blass acquisition  which occurred on february   and the estimated million contingent consideration related to the athlete s foot acquisition 
we have not included contracts for maintenance support on hardware or software that we own because we generally pay in advance for these services and have the option of choosing whether or not to renew these services each year 
we also have not included in this table potential contingent liability that we may have to the buyers of our ems  transportation or mobile government businesses  under the terms of the purchase agreements with the buyers and we cannot readily estimate the potential amount of liabilities that might arise in the future  if any 
obligations under our new master loan agreement  which we enetered into and began to borrow under in march  will be included as long term debt in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the bio key lease  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings or other debt 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment funds which normally conform to the following investment strategies  investing at least of assets in us government securities and repurchase agreements for those securities  investing in us government securities issued by entities that are chartered or sponsored by congress but whose securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the us treasury  maintaining a dollar weighted average maturity at sixty days or less 
these investments are generally subject to the risks of changes in market interest rates and the impact of any declines in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support 
a change in interest rates would not materially impact the returns on our excess cash balances 
in general  the company accepts a slightly lower rate of interest on its investments in exchange for a higher credit rating from the issuer or the guarantor of the securities in which the company invests 
our primary objective in investing cash balances is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  rather than to seek enhanced investment returns 
under the new bank credit agreement  we are subject to interest rate risk from the fluctuation in libor rates 
at the request of our bank  we are obligated to hedge the interest rate exposure on a certain portion of our outstanding loans 
the athlete s foot has franchisees located in countries that transact business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the foreign currency is translated into u 
s dollars to determine the amount of royalties due to the company 
because the franchisees are located in forty countries  the currency risk to the company is well diversified and the risk of any single currency to the company is low
