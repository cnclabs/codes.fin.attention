first trust advisors lp licenses the dividend leaders index and introduced an exchange traded fund based on this index in february we re in the process of developing a series of commodity indexes  which we plan to introduce in we re also planning to launch a family of fixed income indexes  the morningstar fixed income indexes  which can serve as tools for portfolio benchmarking and performance measurement 
these indexes can also be licensed to institutions for creating investment vehicles  including mutual funds  exchange traded funds etfs  and derivative securities 
we plan to launch these indexes in stages beginning in  with the first indexes covering the core fixed income categories of us treasury and corporate bonds

we had approximately sales and marketing professionals on staff as of december  international operations we conduct our business operations outside of the united states through wholly owned or majority owned operating subsidiaries doing business in each of the following markets australia  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  the netherlands  new zealand  norway  people s republic of china both hong kong and the mainland  spain  taiwan  thailand  and the united kingdom 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning revenue from customers and long lived assets from our business operations outside the united states 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on a legal proceeding that may  if decided adversely to us  affect our ownership of our australian and new zealand subsidiaries 
in addition  we hold minority ownership positions in operating companies based in denmark  japan  korea  and sweden 
as of december   we owned approximately of the outstanding shares in morningstar japan kk morningstar japan and our share had a market value of approximately million 
morningstar japan is publicly traded under ticker on the osaka stock exchange hercules market 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on our investments in unconsolidated entities 
to enable these companies to do business in their designated territories  we provide them with the rights to the morningstar name and logo and with access to certain of our products and technology 
each company operating within a particular country is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its own market and working with morningstar s data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases  develop new products  and enhance existing products 
see item a risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to our business operations outside of the united states 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights we treat our brand  product names and logos  software  technology  databases  and other products as proprietary 
we try to protect this property by using trademark  copyright  patent and trade secrets laws  licensing and nondisclosure arrangements  and other security measures 
for example  in the normal course of business  we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements 
the purposes of these agreements are to both define the extent and duration of any third party usage rights and to provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished 
because of the value of our brand name and logo  we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
as we move into new countries  we are continuing to effect these registrations and  in some jurisdictions  the registration of certain product identifiers as well 
to date  we have registered our name and or logo in countries and the european union and have applied for registrations in several other countries 
we currently hold three us patents  one us patent  and one canadian patent 
we believe these patents represent our commitment to developing innovative products and tools for investors 
from time to time  we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions 
it is possible that our continued ability to use the morningstar name or logo  either on a stand alone basis or in association with certain products or services  could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre existing registrations 
similarly  from time to time  we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the morningstar name  either as part of a registered corporate name  a registered domain name or otherwise 
it is possible that our ability to continue to effectively market certain of our products and or services could be adversely affected by these usages 
morningstar and the morningstar logo are registered marks of morningstar in the united states and in certain other jurisdictions

we generally use our standard agreements  whether in paper or electronic form  and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place 
we also maintain licensing agreements with each of our minority owned operations 
we put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property  such as our products and trademarks  to develop and market similar products under our name in their operating territories 
we also license certain intellectual property from third parties  and in the ordinary course of our business  we incorporate and use intellectual property from a variety of third party sources 
seasonality we believe our business has a modest amount of seasonality 
most of our products are sold with subscription or license terms of at least one year  and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement 
this tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products 
over the past three years  sequential revenue growth at the company level on a consolidated basis in the first quarter has been slightly higher than in other quarters 
refer to the discussion in business segments  products  and services above for additional information on the seasonality of each segment 
customers in  our largest customer accounted for less than of our consolidated revenue 
competitive landscape the economic and financial information market has been marked by increased consolidation over the past five years  with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors 
our largest competitors are lipper  standard poor s  and thomson financial services 
these companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours 
we also have a number of smaller competitors in each of our three business segments  for more information  refer to the discussion in business segments  products  and services above 
most of our competitors compete with individual products or segments of our business  we are not aware of any company that offers substantially similar product solutions in all three of our segments 
our non us operations compete with a variety of other companies not named above  including iwl limited  moneymate  and van eyk research 
we believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation  data quality and comprehensiveness  quality of investment analysis and analytics  design  reliability  product support capabilities  and value of the products and services provided 
research and development a key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services 
we strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services 
we have also built a flexible technology platform that allows our products to work together across a full range of investment databases  delivery formats  and market segments 
as a general practice  we manage our own web sites and build our own software applications rather than relying on outside vendors 
this allows us to control our development and better manage costs  enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently 
as of december   our technology team consisted of approximately programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals 
in   and  our development expense represented   and  respectively  of our revenue 
we expect that development expense will continue to represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue in the future

that information is not part of this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this form k when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or operating results could suffer 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
competition could reduce our share of the investment research market and hurt our financial performance 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  with many investment research providers competing for business from individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
we compete with many different types of companies that vary in size  product scope  and media focus  including large and well established distributors of financial information  such as lipper  a division of reuters  the mcgraw hill companies  through its standard poor s division  and thomson corporation  through its thomson financial services division 
in addition to these key competitors  we compete with a variety of other companies in different areas of our business  which we discuss in greater detail in the business segments  products  and services section in item business 
many of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do 
this may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for products and services  to devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services  and to make more attractive offers to potential clients  subscribers  and strategic partners 
industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  or loss of market share  any of which could hurt our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we do not maintain and increase the number of subscriptions and license agreements  our operating results could suffer 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from subscriptions and license agreements 
in  walk in revenue  which we define as revenue from licenses or subscriptions that were in place at the beginning of the year adjusted for cancellations  currency translations  and other routine adjustments during the year  accounted for of our revenue excluding acquisitions 
renewal revenue  which we define as revenue from renewals of licenses or subscriptions  accounted for of our revenue excluding acquisitions 
in general  our subscriptions are paid in advance 
we may be obligated to refund a portion of prepaid subscription fees when a customer cancels 
cancellations may have a negative impact on our revenue and cash position 
our license agreements  which typically do not allow for cancellation  have terms ranging from one to three years 
as of january   we had subscriptions and license agreements in place that were expected to generate million of revenue in  including million of walk in revenue from acquisitions 
in and  cancellations reduced walk in revenue by between and 
our future success depends on our maintaining through renewals and increasing through new subscriptions and license agreements the number of customers who pay for our investment research and services 
further  if the market for our products and services develops more slowly than we expect  or declines  and the number of customers who pay for our services does not increase  or declines  our business  operating results  or financial condition could suffer 
the availability of free or low cost investment information could lead to lower demand for our products and adversely affect our financial results 
investment research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds is widely available for little or no cost from various sources  including the internet and public libraries 
investors can also access information directly from publicly traded companies and mutual funds 
the edgar database available through the securities and exchange commission sec web site provides real time access to sec filings  including annual  semi annual  and quarterly reports 
many brokerage firms also provide financial and investment research to their clients 
the widespread availability of free or low cost investment information may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase the prices we charge for our publications and services and could lead to a lower demand for our products 
a loss of a significant number of customers would hurt our financial results 
certain products and services have historically made up a large percentage of our revenue base 
our business could suffer if sales of these products and services decline 
in  our five largest products based on revenue investment consulting  morningstar advisor workstation  licensed data  morningstar 
com and principia accounted for a combined of our consolidated revenue 
we believe that sales of these products and services will continue to make up a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue for the foreseeable future 
if we experience a significant decline in sales of any of these products for any reason  it would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and could harm our business 
the independent equity research we re providing to six investment banks under the terms of the global analyst research settlement accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue in the period during which investment banks are required to provide independent equity research to their clients will expire in july we cannot guarantee that we will retain or replace this equity research revenue after that date 
because these contracts include both renewal and cancellation options and the firms named in the settlement are free to choose from a variety of research providers  we also cannot guarantee that we will retain this business for any period prior to july our investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties 
our investment advisory operations involve fiduciary obligations that require us to act in the best interests of our clients 
we may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties 
we may not be able to prevent clients from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty 
because we currently provide investment advisory services on substantial assets  we could face substantial liability to our clients if we breach our fiduciary duties 
in addition  we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations  even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty 
changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory operations  compliance failures  or regulatory action could adversely affect our business 
our investment advisory operations are relatively new and a growing part of our overall business 
our acquisition of ibbotson associates in substantially increased our business in this area 
the securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex 
the activities of our investment advisory operations are primarily subject to provisions of the investment advisers act of the advisers act and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in addition  our investment management business is conducted through a broker dealer registered under the securities exchange act of the exchange act and is subject to the rules of the national association of securities dealers nasd 
it is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business 
the laws  rules  and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future and we may not be able to comply with any such changes 
if we fail to comply with any applicable law  rule  or regulation  we could be fined  sanctioned  or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our reputation and business may be harmed by possible conflicts of interest 
we offer products and services to our institutional clients  which include banks  brokerage firms  insurance companies  mutual fund companies  media outlets  and retirement plan providers and sponsors 
our institutional business generated revenue  before intersegment eliminations  of million  or of our consolidated revenue in and million  or of our consolidated revenue  in we also provide ratings  analyst research  and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients 
the fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services may create the perception that our ratings  research  and recommendations are not impartial 
this perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research 
any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business 
our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could strain our resources 
we completed several acquisitions in  including ibbotson associates  which was our largest acquisition to date 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate the employees  product lines  business systems  and operations following any acquisition 
we expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
acquisitions  investments  and joint ventures involve a number of risks 
they can be time consuming and may divert management s attention from day to day operations 
financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities or a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt 
acquisitions might also result in losing key employees 
we may fail to successfully complete any acquisitions  investments  or joint ventures 
we may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from an acquisition to earn a return on the associated purchase price 
we could face liability for the information we publish  including information based on data we obtain from other parties 
we may be subject to claims for securities law violations  defamation including libel and slander  negligence  or other claims relating to the information we publish 
for example  investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error  or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees 
we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites 
we rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data 
these sources include securities exchanges  fund companies  and transfer agents 
accordingly  in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors  we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others 
defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time consuming and could adversely impact our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we could be subject to fines  penalties  or other sanctions as a result of investigations by the new york attorney general s office and the department of labor related to the investment consulting services morningstar associates  llc provides to retirement plan providers  including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors 
as previously disclosed  the new york attorney general s office and the department of labor are conducting separate investigations related to some of the products and services offered by morningstar associates  llc 
see item legal proceedings for a description of these matters 
we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of these matters  which may include the institution of administrative  civil  injunctive  or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  and other remedies and sanctions  any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price  the inability to attract or retain key employees  and the loss of customers 
we also cannot predict what impact  if any  these matters may have on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we have not established any reserves relating to these matters 
we could face liability as a result of a proceeding brought by mr 
graham rich  a former managing director  chief executive officer  and beneficial shareholder of morningstar research pty limited  and two companies controlled by mr 
rich 
in  mr 
graham rich  the then managing director and chief executive officer of morningstar research pty limited morningstar australia  and one of two companies controlled by mr 
rich  filed a suit in the supreme court of new south wales  australia against morningstar and certain of its officers and nominee directors on the board of morningstar australia 
the claims seek various forms of relief  including monetary damages in the amount of australian million  the setting aside of transactions which resulted in morningstar obtaining control of morningstar australia  and an order either setting aside morningstar s acquisition of shares formerly beneficially owned by mr

rich and his companies notified morningstar that they would be seeking the leave of the court to amend the claim to include a claim relating to morningstar s acquisition of aspect huntley pty ltd 
aspect in the amended claim alleges various breaches of obligations owed by morningstar to morningstar australia and seeks various forms of relief  including an equity interest in aspect and compensatory damages 
the court has not yet granted leave to allow the amendment to proceed 
the parties have discussed settling the claims but have been unable to reach an agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  we offered to settle all claims for australian million which then approximated us million  and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 we recorded a reserve in this amount 
in december  we increased our offer to settle all claims to approximately australian million  which as of december  approximated us million  and  in accordance with sfas no 
 have a reserve recorded for this amount 
while morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims against it  we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding 
we also cannot predict what impact  if any  this matter may have on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
a prolonged outage of our database and network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time sensitive  up to date data and information 
we rely on our computer equipment  database storage facilities  and other office equipment  which are mainly located in our chicago headquarters or elsewhere in the chicago area 
our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars  internet failures  computer viruses  and other events beyond our control  including disasters affecting chicago 
we maintain off site back up facilities for our database and network equipment  but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters 
we do not currently have the capability to switch over all of our systems to a back up facility immediately 
if we suffer a significant database or network facility outage  our business could experience disruption until we fully implement our back up systems 
any losses  service disruption  or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the internet 
any failures or disruptions could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers 
many of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the internet 
our ability to deliver information using the internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures  service outages at third party internet providers  or increased government regulation 
if disruptions  failures  or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the internet occur  our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired 
we could face liability related to our storage of personal information about our users 
customers routinely input personal investment and financial information  including portfolio holdings and credit card information  on our web sites 
we could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user s personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user s name  address  portfolio holdings  or credit card information 
any such event could subject us to claims for unauthorized credit card purchases  impersonation or other similar fraud claims  or claims for other misuses of personal information  such as unauthorized marketing or unauthorized access to personal portfolio information 
our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  including our executive officers 
we experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations 
these organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees 
competition for these employees is intense  and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers  including joe mansueto  our chairman  chief executive officer  and controlling shareholder 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers could hurt our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we do not carry any life insurance on our executive officers 
we do not have employment agreements or non compete agreements in place with any of our executive officers 
they may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses 
our operations outside of the united states are expanding and involve special challenges that we may not be able to meet 
over the past three years  our operations outside of the united states have generated an increasing amount of revenue  expanding from million in to million in there are certain risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including difficulties in reaching new markets due to established competitors  difficulties in staffing  managing  and integrating non us operations  differences in laws and policies from country to country  exposure to varying legal standards  including intellectual property protection laws  and currency exchange rates and exchange controls 
we do not currently hedge any of our currency exposure  which may adversely impact our financial results 
these risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world  which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow 
in addition  we now have approximately programmers and data analysts working in our development center in china 
over the past several years  we have been moving a significant percentage of our data collection and development operations to this location 
because china has a restrictive government under centralized control  we cannot predict the level of political and regulatory risk that may impact our operations 
any difficulties that we face in successfully maintaining our development center in china may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide 
changes in market and economic conditions could lower demand for our products and services 
we provide our products and services to individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
conditions in the financial and securities markets may have an impact on our performance 
for example  in the event that the us or international financial markets suffers a severe or prolonged downturn  demand for our products and services may decline  and our revenue and profitability levels could suffer 
the financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors  such as us and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance  that are beyond our control 
in addition  as our fee based asset management business increases as a percentage of total revenue  our results might become more closely tied to the performance of the market 
we attempt to mitigate this potential risk by diversifying our business into various markets around the world  as well as different segments and price points within each area 
our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry experiences a downturn or a slowdown in growth 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products and services related to mutual funds 
the mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past years 
mutual fund assets may not continue to expand at the same rate in future years 
settlements and regulatory actions in the mutual fund industry following the market timing scandal that emerged in  downturns in the financial markets  or a relative increase in usage of other investment vehicles could cause a decline in investor interest in mutual funds 
if the mutual fund industry experiences a downturn or a slower growth rate than in the past  it could negatively impact demand for some of our products 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand building efforts and ability to compete effectively 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information 
further  effective trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services 
our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers  or has a pre existing registration on  one or more of them 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand  devalue our proprietary content  and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 
control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders 
as of december   joe mansueto  our chairman and chief executive officer  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation  or sale of our assets 
he also has the ability to control our management and affairs 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover  or other business combination involving us  discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us  or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders 
moreover  because of joe s substantial ownership  we are a controlled company for purposes of the nasdaq marketplace rules 
this means that  if in the future we elect to be treated as a controlled company under the nasdaq marketplace rules  we will not be required by nasdaq to have a majority of independent directors or to maintain compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees composed entirely of independent directors to continue to list our shares on nasdaq 
fluctuations in our operating results may negatively impact our stock price 
we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs  which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results 
as a result  a decline in our revenue may lead to larger decline in operating income 
a substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs  marketing programs  and corporate overhead  none of which can be adjusted quickly 
our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue 
if actual revenue falls behind our expectations  or if our expenses increase before revenues do  our operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one on one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts 
because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock  our stock price may be volatile 
if our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively impact our stock price 
if our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could fall 
a reduction in ownership by joe mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low 
the lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price 
low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion 
our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions 
morningstar has historically granted options to employees as a significant part of our overall compensation package 
as of december   our employees and non employee directors held options to acquire  shares of common stock   of which were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share and  were not exercisable and had an average exercise price of per share 
to the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock  there may be further dilution 
future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution 
we may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock 
any such financing may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have not received any comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the exchange act 
item properties our headquarters and us based offices are located in chicago  illinois  and consist of approximately  square feet of leased space 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in countries around the world 
we believe that our office facilities are adequate for our immediate needs and that additional or substitute space is available if needed to accommodate growth and expansion 
in december  we signed a year lease for approximately  square feet of office space in an office tower being constructed at north state street in chicago  illinois 
we are scheduled to move into the new space when the lease starts in item legal proceedings morningstar australia in  mr 
graham rich  the then managing director and chief executive officer of morningstar research pty limited morningstar australia  and one of two companies controlled by mr 
rich  filed a suit in the supreme court of new south wales  australia against morningstar and certain of its officers and nominee directors on the board of morningstar australia 
mr 
rich was also a beneficial owner of shares in morningstar australia 
mr 
rich and his company originally sought an injunction  which  if granted  would have precluded morningstar australia from terminating the services of mr 
rich and from issuing additional shares to morningstar in exchange for the provision of further funding by morningstar to morningstar australia 
further  mr 
rich and his company sought an order that a provisional liquidator be appointed for morningstar australia 
the court rejected this injunction application  observing that morningstar australia would be insolvent without financial backing from morningstar 
the application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator also failed 
the services of mr 
rich were terminated in november mr 
rich and his company were ordered to pay morningstar s costs of the injunction proceedings 
mr 
rich and the two companies controlled by mr 
rich have additional pending claims  alleging  among other things  breaches by morningstar of contracts and statutory and general law duties  misleading  deceptive  and unconscionable conduct by morningstar  oppression by morningstar and its nominee directors  claims under the industrial relations act of new south wales  breaches of directors duties by morningstar s nominee directors  and conflict of interest 
the claims seek various forms of relief  including monetary damages in the amount of australian  the setting aside of transactions which resulted in morningstar obtaining control of morningstar australia  and an order either setting aside morningstar s acquisition of the shares formerly beneficially owned by mr 
rich and his companies or determining a different price for this acquisition 
in the alternative  mr 
rich and his companies seek an order that they be entitled to purchase the shares in morningstar australia at a price to be determined by the court or book value as defined in the morningstar australia shareholders agreement 
morningstar has denied the claims and filed counter claims against mr 
rich and certain of his companies  alleging breaches of statutory  general law  and contractual duties 
in july  the court decided morningstar s application for security for its potential additional costs in the litigation by ordering the two companies controlled by mr 
rich to provide approximately australian  to the court as security for these potential costs 
morningstar has been paid some of its costs and will be entitled to be paid its costs in the future only if the court makes a determination to that effect 
the court stayed the proceedings pending its receipt of the security and indicated that it would entertain an application by morningstar for additional security at a later time in the proceedings 
in may  mr 
rich obtained conditional leave of the court to begin a proceeding in the name of morningstar australia against morningstar and its nominee directors 
the leave was  however  subject to the following conditions i mr 
rich must pay and bear  and indemnify morningstar australia against  all costs  charges  and expenses of and incidental to the bringing and continuation of the proceeding except as the court may otherwise direct or allow and may not seek contribution or indemnity from morningstar australia for any of these costs  charges  or expenses  ii morningstar australia  or mr 
rich on its behalf  together with the two companies controlled by mr 
rich were required to provide to the court  as security for morningstar s costs  approximately australian  as described in the preceding paragraph  and iii approximately australian  in costs owed by mr 
rich and one of his companies to morningstar in respect of the injunction proceedings were required to be paid to morningstar 
these conditions have been satisfied 
in september  mr 
rich and his companies filed a second further amended statement of claim  consolidating the claims 
morningstar filed a defence to that pleading and an amended cross claim against mr 
rich  both his companies  and a third australian company controlled by mr 
rich 
in december  morningstar applied to the court for further security for its potential additional costs in the litigation 
the court has not yet held a hearing for this application 
in february  mr 
rich and his companies notified morningstar that they would be seeking the leave of the court to amend the second further amended statement of claim to include a claim relating to morningstar s acquisition of aspect huntley pty ltd 
aspect in the amended claim alleges various breaches of obligations owed by morningstar to morningstar australia and seeks various forms of relief  including an equity interest in aspect and compensatory damages 
the court has not yet granted leave to allow the amendment to proceed 
the parties have discussed settling the claims but have been unable to reach an agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  morningstar offered to settle all claims for australian  which then approximated us  and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  morningstar recorded a reserve in this amount 
in december  morningstar increased its offer to settle all claims to approximately australian  which at december  approximated us  and  in accordance with sfas no 
 morningstar has a reserve recorded in this amount 
while morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims against it  we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding 
morningstar associates  llc subpoenas from securities and exchange commission  new york attorney general s office  and department of labor securities and exchange commission in february  morningstar associates  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of morningstar  inc  received a request from the securities and exchange commission sec for the voluntary production of documents relating to the investment consulting services the company offers to retirement plan providers  including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors 
in july  the sec issued a subpoena to morningstar associates that was virtually identical to its february request 
subsequently  the sec focused on disclosure relating to an optional service offered to retirement plan sponsors employers that select k plan services from ing  one of morningstar associates clients 
in response to the sec investigation  ing and morningstar associates revised certain documents for plan sponsors to further clarify the roles of ing and morningstar associates in providing that service 
the revisions also help reinforce that morningstar associates makes its selections only from funds available within ing s various retirement products 
on january   the sec notified morningstar associates that it ended its investigation  with no enforcement action  fines  or penalties 
new york attorney general s office in december  morningstar associates received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office seeking information and documents related to an investigation the new york attorney general s office is conducting 
the request is similar in scope to the sec subpoena described above 
morningstar associates has provided the requested information and documents and continues to cooperate fully with the new york attorney general s office 
in january  morningstar associates received a notice of proposed litigation from the new york attorney general s office 
the notice centers on the same issues that became the focus of the sec investigation described above 
the notice gave morningstar associates the opportunity to explain why the new york attorney general s office should not institute proceedings 
morningstar associates promptly submitted its explanation 
to date  the new york attorney general s office has not taken any further action 
we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of this matter  which may include the institution of administrative  civil  injunctive  or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  and other remedies and sanctions  any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price  the inability to attract or retain key employees  and the loss of customers 
we also cannot predict what impact  if any  this matter may have on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
united states department of labor in may  morningstar associates received a subpoena from the united states department of labor  seeking information and documents related to an investigation the department of labor is conducting 
the department of labor subpoena is substantially similar in scope to the sec and new york attorney general subpoenas 
in january  the department of labor issued a request for additional documents pursuant to the may subpoena  including documents and information regarding morningstar associates retirement advice products for plan participants 
morningstar associates continues to cooperate fully with the department of labor 
we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of this matter  which may include the institution of administrative  civil  injunctive  or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  and other remedies and sanctions  any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price  the inability to attract or retain key employees  and the loss of customers

in addition to these proceedings  we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business 
although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted  we do not believe that the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition

r 
prior to this date  we accounted for our equity plans in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 stock based compensation 
the total expense for stock based compensation is distributed with other employee compensation costs in the appropriate expense categories of our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to our initial public offering in may  in accordance with sfas no 
 we used two accounting methods 
for options granted under plans that may have required us to settle the options in cash  we used the liability method 
under this method we recorded a liability for a vested option equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the option at the end of the reporting period 
if this fair value increased over the reporting period  we recorded an expense and  if it decreased  we recorded income 
for options granted under plans that did not require us to settle the options in cash  we used the equity method 
under this method we calculated the fair value of the option at the time of grant using a black scholes model and recorded expense over the vesting period 
in each year  our aggregate stock based compensation expense reflects the impact of options granted in prior years 
subsequent to our initial public offering  we no longer settle stock options for cash 
as a result  all of our options are currently accounted for under the equity method 
refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock based compensation 
in  we began participating in voluntary disclosure or similar programs related to state sales tax 
through these programs  we identified sales tax amounts attributed to and prior years and negotiated or are in discussions with local tax authorities to settle these amounts 
we recorded total expense of million in    and  the years to which these sales tax amounts apply 
based on the most current information available  the actual sales tax expense was not materially different from the estimates recorded in those periods 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required to be reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  nor should this data be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of recording deferred revenue  our working capital may at times be negative 
in the second quarter of  upon completion of our initial public offering  we reclassified million related to stock options accounted for as long term liabilities  in accordance with sfas no 
 to additional paid in capital 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
these shares commenced trading on may  and now trade on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol morn 
all of these shares were sold by affiliates of softbank finance corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of softbank corp 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares 
in addition  we granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to an additional  shares at the initial public offering price to cover over allotments

understanding our company our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals 
we offer an extensive line of internet  software  and print based products for individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
we also offer asset management services for advisors  institutions  and retirement plan participants 
we have historically generated recurring revenue because many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as our products and services focus more on internet based platforms and assets under management 
we strive to realize this operating leverage by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographic markets 
we manage morningstar to maximize our long term results  while staying focused on our mission of helping investors and adhering to our company values 
we invest significantly in new product development and in enhancements to our current offerings 
it typically takes many years to recoup these investments  but we believe they are critical to building long term value for our shareholders 
we emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability 
we operate our decentralized business structure in three global business segments individual  advisor  and institutional 
early in our history  our product lineup emphasized products for individual investors 
as a result  the individual segment contributed a majority of our revenue 
in the early s  our advisor segment became a more important part of our business 
more recently  we ve begun serving more investors through our institutional segment  which was the largest of our three segments in terms of revenue in   and in all three of these segments  we believe our work helps individual investors make better investment decisions 

gbiijpg 
key business characteristics we believe our business has the following characteristics recurring revenue we have historically generated recurring revenue because many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
these subscriptions and licenses generally come up for renewal after one to three year terms 
many of the license agreements in our advisor and institutional segments span multiple years 
because of this recurring revenue  we generally have subscriptions and license agreements in place for a meaningful percentage of our total annual revenue at the beginning of each year 
we think of this as our walk in revenue 
we separate our annual revenue into three categories  defined as follows new revenue 
we define new revenue as revenue from selling additional products to current customers or from selling to new customers  renewal revenue 
we define renewal revenue as revenue from renewals of subscriptions or licenses  and walk in revenue 
we define walk in revenue as revenue we expect to recognize during the year from subscriptions and license agreements in place as of january of each year adjusted for cancellations  currency translations  and other routine adjustments during the year 
beginning in  we no longer plan to report quarterly information on new  renewal  and walk in revenue 
we re currently evaluating potential new metrics that may be more useful to investors 
in addition to looking at walk in  renewal  and new revenue  we calculate a retention rate to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographic markets 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as our products and services focus more on internet based platforms and assets under management 
in the past  we have made investments in building our databases and content that have hurt our short term operating results for certain periods 
in the past several years  our profitability has improved because we ve been able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
we look for this operating leverage to be evident in our operations over the long term 
deferred revenue we frequently collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we can use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
although we may need to issue refunds for the unused portion of the subscription if a customer cancels  we generally have used cash collected in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions to fund many of our other activities 
the deferred revenue shown on our balance sheet as of december  totaled million  including deferred revenue from acquisitions 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue 
the million increase in deferred revenue from to includes the impact of acquisitions 
how our business works revenue we earn revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
many of our offerings  such as our newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  are sold via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms over other periods ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our web sites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  morningstar encorr  retirement advice  and licensed data 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  our fees are generally based on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculated as a percentage of assets under management 
we also collect fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that are calculated as a percentage of assets under management 
operating expense we classify our expenses into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes the compensation expense for employees who produce the products we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers the cost of production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expenses such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios and costs for outsourced product implementation expense for development projects associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
development 
this category mainly includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and make enhancements to existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and corporate expenses  including corporate systems  accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist mainly of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we recognize depreciation and amortization costs for these items over their estimated useful lives  generally ranging from three to seven years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
international operations we consolidate the results of our majority owned operations outside the united states 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan  korea  denmark  and sweden using the equity method 
how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because they are  by their nature  subjective and could have an effect on our company s stock price 
we want to avoid creating any incentive within our company to make the numbers 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required to be reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  and should not be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis and use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
investment landscape  research  and data after a strong rally toward the end of  morningstar s us market index  a broad stock market benchmark  finished the year with a total return of  compared with a gain in markets outside of the united states posted similarly strong results 
with the investment climate generally favorable and all diversified equity fund categories posting positive total returns for the year  mutual funds based in the united states enjoyed positive net inflows for the year  and cash flows into equity funds were about higher than in net cash flows into hybrid funds were lower than in  but cash inflows to taxable bond  municipal bond  and money market funds all increased over levels 
the number of mutual funds increased slightly to about  during  and total fund assets increased by about to trillion as of year end 
the investment company institute estimates that about million households in the united states  or of all households  own mutual funds 
this total is still down slightly from the peak level in  but higher than the totals in each of the previous four years 
we believe that continued asset growth and widespread usage of mutual funds is significant because a relatively large portion of morningstar s business has historically focused on this area 
however  this percentage has been declining as we ve expanded into equity research and other areas 
the sec issued interpretive guidance in july regarding the use of soft dollar payments  which are arrangements in which investment advisors receive research or other services from broker dealers in exchange for executing trades through that broker 
more recently  the department of labor proposed regulations that would require brokerage firms to report separately the cost of brokerage and research services provided to pension funds 
pension funds would also be required to disclose soft dollar research payments 
also related to soft dollars  asset managers in the united kingdom recently began disclosing the amount of brokerage commissions used for transaction costs and research 
trade associations for fund managers and brokers based in france recently issued recommendations to government regulators related to the amount and usage of brokerage commissions  and financial regulators in canada have also proposed new soft dollar regulations that would require asset managers to itemize soft dollar costs and allocate them to clients 
we believe these developments are important because they underscore a longer term trend toward greater pricing transparency and are prompting debate about the cost and value of securities research 
in addition  we believe the trend toward unbundled commissions may place additional pressure on budgets for sell side research  leading to further cuts in coverage lists and increased demand for independent research from companies such as morningstar 
in september  president bush signed the credit agency reform act  which will allow companies that meet certain standards to register with the sec as rating organizations  broadening competition from current restrictions that only allow credit ratings by five firms currently designated as nationally recognized rating agencies 
we believe that increased competition in the credit ratings industry would be favorable for investors  and we re continuing to monitor the potential impact of this development on our business 
we continued to see strong interest in alternative asset classes during hedge funds  in particular  continued to enjoy strong growth 
based on estimates published by hennessee group  hedge fund industry assets increased to trillion in december  a increase from trillion at the beginning of the year 
the number of hedge funds and funds of funds continued to balloon  with more than  funds in existence as of december based on a study from pertrac financial solutions  compared with about  as of december we substantially increased the size of our hedge fund database with our acquisition of the institutional hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
we re continuing to expand the information we provide on hedge funds to meet investors need for information on this growing asset class 
several firms  including moody s  standard poor s  and fitch  have announced plans to introduce hedge fund ratings in response to investor interest in this area 
we continue to monitor developments in the industry and have continued to expand our analyst coverage on hedge funds 
we re also continuing to evaluate the possibility of providing a rating system for hedge funds 
following an appeals court ruling that overturned a previous sec rule requiring hedge funds to register as investment advisors  numerous hedge fund firms have withdrawn their previous registrations 
at the same time  losses experienced by individual funds have led some industry leaders to call for increased regulation 
the sec has also voiced concern about potential insider trading on the part of hedge funds  as well as the potential risks to hedge fund shareholders 
near the end of  the sec proposed increasing the minimum net worth requirement for hedge fund investors to million  from million previously 
as debate about hedge fund regulation goes on  we plan to continue our efforts to make the industry more transparent for investors 
asset growth in separately managed accounts was also relatively strong in based on data from the money management institute  assets in separate accounts increased by about to reach billion as of september   compared with billion as of september  assets in exchange traded funds etfs increased to reach about billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  based on data from the investment company institute 
etfs continued to gain share from mutual funds in some specialized areas of the market because of their lower annual costs  particularly in passive investing strategies 
to meet greater investor demand for information on etfs  we have increased our analyst coverage in this area and introduced a new rating system for etfs in march in addition  we recently launched an etf newsletter and expanded our annual softcover reference guide  the morningstar etfs  to become the morningstar etfs individual investor market with market conditions generally positive  the environment for advertising sales has been relatively healthy 
a recent report from the interactive advertising bureau estimated that spending on internet advertising totaled about billion in  a increase over billion in many advertisers have continued to shift traditional print  radio  and television placements to the internet 
based on research from nielsen netratings  page views to most retail investment web sites remained fairly consistent in page views to morningstar 
com remained lower than those of larger competing sites such as yahoo finance  aol money finance  and msn money  but the time spent per visit and average page views per visit statistics remained higher than those of competing sites 
we believe this indicates that investors view our site as useful and find value in the information we provide 
we also appeal to a highly qualified audience based on income levels and investable assets 
financial advisor market the aging of the american population and the corresponding need for more information and advice on retirement income planning has been an important trend in the advisor segment 
to meet this need  in we launched retirement income strategist  a web based software application that helps advisors analyze retirement income for clients who are retired or nearing retirement 
retirement income strategist helps advisors analyze whether an individual s savings will last during retirement and explore alternative scenarios for sustaining income during retirement 
we also created a retirement income education center  a hosted web site offering educational content and tools about retirement income for financial advisors affiliated with institutions 
many advisors have also sought to streamline and simplify their operations  to meet this need  some advisors have been outsourcing investment management so they can spend more time on planning related issues and client management 
we ve also seen a continuing consolidation trend among broker dealers and other firms in the advisor segment 
for example  ubs increased the size of its advisor force by purchasing piper jaffray s brokerage unit in we believe that this ongoing acquisition trend is being driven by the desire to increase scale and maximize cost efficiencies 
independent financial advisors have continued to gain market share among high net worth investors  but larger institutions are benefiting from their lower cost structures and economies of scale 
as the financial advisory landscape continues to evolve  we believe advisors will continue to demand comprehensive research platforms and integrated portfolio tools 
institutional market in august  president bush signed the pension protection act of  which includes provisions for offering investment advice programs for participants in defined contribution plans 
the investment advice provision went into effect for employer sponsored retirement plans on january  among other things  the new act allows plan service providers  mutual fund companies  and brokerage firms to offer investment advice to plan participants using their own computer models including advising them to invest in their own proprietary funds  subject to certification of the computer model by an independent expert 
we re continuing to monitor the potential impact of this provision on our business 
although more companies may rely on retirement plan providers to offer investment advice to their employees  we believe there will be ongoing demand for third party advice as well 
in particular  we believe there may be opportunities for us to continue to license our computer driven advice model to plan providers 
the legislation also contains provisions that may encourage automatic enrollment and the use of managed retirement accounts as a default investment option 
therefore  we believe this development may have a positive impact on the managed retirement accounts that we offer through morningstar associates and ibbotson associates  two of our investment advisory subsidiaries 
continuing an industry wide trend toward separating the manufacturing and distribution of investment portfolios  merrill lynch spun off its investment management group in  selling its asset management group to blackrock  an asset management firm 
also in  principal financial completed its acquisition of washington mutual s mutual fund management arm  along with its distributor and shareholder services business 
in early  the parent company of putnam investments marsh mclennan companies reached an agreement to sell its asset management unit 
we continue to monitor mergers and acquisitions in the asset management industry because of their potential impact on specific areas of our business 
performance summary the list below summarizes the key accomplishments and disappointments that our management team has highlighted related to our performance accomplishments we successfully completed and integrated several acquisitions  including ibbotson associates  a leading provider of asset allocation research and services  aspect huntley  a leading provider of equity information  research  and financial trade publishing in australia  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
we significantly expanded our hedge fund  separate account  and european and offshore mutual fund databases 
we created a pension and life fund database in the united kingdom and established mutual fund databases in taiwan and singapore 
we introduced new investor return data  also known as dollar weighted return  to capture how the average investor fared in a fund 
we launched several new web based software applications  including retirement income strategist  which analyzes an investor s income needs in retirement  and morningstar portfolio builder  which helps advisors quickly create portfolio proposals 
we achieved meaningful sales of morningstar direct outside of the united states  with nearly of direct s revenue now coming from international markets 
we also introduced several new products overseas  including portfolio builder and morningstar hypothetical illustrator  a tool that creates customized historical investment illustrations 
disappointments software development for our major upgrade of morningstar direct took longer than we expected 
the regulatory investigations into morningstar associates  which began in late and early  continued to consume management s time in as we held ongoing discussions with regulators in an attempt to work toward a resolution

this measure is not equivalent to any measure of performance required to be reported under us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
consolidated revenue in  our consolidated revenue increased by over we finished the year with more than million in consolidated revenue 
this past year was notable for us because we made three key acquisitions ibbotson associates  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
adding these operations to our existing business contributed million of revenue in  the majority of which was from ibbotson 
while acquisitions helped expand our revenue base in  we also generated strong organic growth 
without the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translations  organic revenue increased in organic revenue is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the table below presents a reconciliation from consolidated revenue to revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations organic revenue change consolidated revenue less acquisitions nmf less impact of foreign currency nmf revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations in contrast to  acquisitions had only a minor impact on our results in we acquired variable annuity research database services vards from finetre corporation in january  and this business contributed revenue of million in in both and  our growth was diversified by segment  with all three segments generating meaningful revenue growth 
our institutional segment is the largest of our three segments  so it has the greatest impact on our overall results 
the institutional segment generated a large percentage of our total revenue increase in both and institutional segment revenue increased million in  accounting for about of morningstar s total revenue increase before eliminating intersegment revenue 
in  institutional segment revenue increased by million  generating about of our total revenue increase before eliminating intersegment revenue 
the advisor segment accounted for approximately of the revenue increase in both periods 
individual segment revenue increased million  or  in and million  or  in revenue by segment amount amount amount individual advisor institutional elimination of intersegment revenue consolidated revenue on a product level  investment consulting was the largest driver behind our revenue increase in and was also a major contributor to revenue growth in newly added revenue from ibbotson s consulting business generated more than of the growth in investment consulting  with the remaining amount from morningstar s existing consulting business 
in both and  we continued to expand our relationships and increase assets under management with existing clients for the asset allocation services we provide for funds of funds and variable annuities 
investment consulting surpassed licensed data and morningstar advisor workstation to become our single largest product based on revenue in advisor workstation was the second largest driver of the revenue increase in and the largest contributor in about of the growth in this product was driven by the enterprise edition  which we offer to financial advisors affiliated with larger firms  with the remaining amount contributed by the office edition for independent financial advisors 
total licenses for advisor workstation in the united states increased by about in  and our average revenue per license also increased 
newly incorporated revenue from encorr  an asset allocation software package we acquired with ibbotson  was another major contributor to revenue growth in morningstar 
com and licensed data were the fourth and fifth largest drivers of revenue growth in both and  although morningstar 
com s contribution was slightly larger relative to licensed data in principia was the only one of our top five products based on revenue that didn t experience revenue growth in and because many of our customers have been adopting advisor workstation  our newer web based investment planning system 
principia revenue was essentially flat in and declined about in our strategy for principia is to continue increasing revenue per user to maintain the product s revenue base 
equity research  which mainly consists of revenue related to the global analyst research settlement  was another key contributor to revenue growth in both and  but to a greater extent in we began recognizing revenue for our equity research related to the settlement in july  which led to a favorable year over year comparison in in addition  we entered into an equity research agreement with a sixth investment bank involved in the settlement in september and began recognizing this new revenue in the fourth quarter of that year 
our revenue in this area also benefited in and because we ve continued to increase the number of stocks under coverage  leading to higher contract values for some of the agreements related to the settlement 

gbiijpg 
revenue from non us operations increased million  or  to million in our acquisitions of aspect huntley and ibbotson contributed million of the increase 
non us revenue made up about of consolidated revenue in  compared with about in in  our us revenue grew at a faster pace than us revenue  partly because of the new revenue related to the global analyst research settlement and growth in our investment consulting business in the united states 
foreign currency translations contributed million of the increase in non us revenue in and million in excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translations  our non us revenue increased approximately and in and  respectively

com individual advisor workstation advisor investment consulting institutional revenue composition as discussed in the recurring revenue section of key business characteristics  we separate our revenue into three categories new revenue  renewal revenue  and walk in revenue 
the following graph illustrates the composition of our revenue over the past four years 

gbiijpg 
our revenue consisted of million in new revenue  or  of our revenue excluding acquisitions for the year 
renewal revenue accounted for million  or  of revenue excluding acquisitions 
walk in revenue accounted for million  or  of this amount 
as of january   our estimate of walk in revenue was million  which includes million from acquisitions completed in this estimate is subject to change based on cancellations during the year  the impact of currency translations  and other routine adjustments 
in comparison  our walk in revenue as of january   was million 
in the second quarter of  we reclassified a portion of our revenue composition  reducing walk in revenue by million  to more accurately reflect the cancellation terms of certain institutional contracts 
cancellations  foreign currency translations  and other routine adjustments subsequently reduced this revenue by million  or approximately  to million by the end of this amount includes the positive impact of a one time payment we received in the third quarter of because two clients merged and eliminated a redundant license 
the walk in revenue figure does not include variable revenue from asset related services such as morningstar managed portfolios  managed retirement account services  and investment consulting that are calculated as a percentage of total assets under management 
these areas of our business have been increasing over the past several years 
in  we estimate that our retention rate for subscription based products  such as principia  premium membership service  and print and online newsletters  averaged between to  consistent with the level shown in for contract based products and services  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between and in  compared with an estimated to in the figure for contract based products includes the impact of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable contracts 
the renewal rate for contract based products and services declined slightly in for three main reasons the impact of outstanding renewals in our data services business  our strategy of discontinuing some lower margin contracts in our retirement advice business  and a smaller increase in the number of incremental users added upon renewal in relative to for certain products  such as morningstar direct 
while we re satisfied with the retention and renewal rates we achieved in  we constantly strive to improve these measures because the cost of maintaining existing customers is lower than the cost of acquiring new customers to replace business that doesn t renew 

gbiijpg 
consolidated operating expense change change operating expense of revenue pp pp our consolidated operating expense increased million in two key factors impacted all of our operating expense categories compensation related costs including incentive compensation and recent acquisitions 
bonus expense recorded in increased million because of continued improvements in our financial performance  as well as increased headcount 
a majority of our bonus pool is based on growth in our operating income  which may or may not recur 
other compensation related expense  mainly including salaries  benefits  and sales commissions  increased million because of an increase in headcount  as well as annual salary increases 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with approximately  as of december  about half of the increase in headcount was related to acquisitions  and a good portion of the remaining increase was from continued hiring in our development center in china 
lower stock based compensation expense partially offset increases in all of our operating expense categories  but to a limited extent 
stock based compensation expense decreased million in because we are no longer required to record expense under the liability method 
in the first quarter of  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense under this method  which did not recur in in addition to higher compensation related expenses  the increase in operating expense includes million of amortization expense for the intangible assets acquired with ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
we expect that amortization of these intangible assets will be an ongoing cost through the useful lives of these assets  which generally range from three to years 
our consolidated operating expense increased million in approximately half of this increase was from higher cost of goods sold  the remaining portion of the increase occurred across other operating expense categories 
the increase in consolidated operating expense was largely driven by a million increase in compensation related costs  including salaries  bonus  benefits  and sales commissions  stemming from higher headcount 
we record these costs in the various operating expense categories as appropriate 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with approximately  as of december  approximately of the increase in headcount was driven by technical staffing in our development center in china 
most of the remaining increase in headcount consists of additional stock analysts in our us operations and increased staffing in our corporate departments to meet the requirements of being a public company 
an increase in spending for corporate initiatives and legal fees and a decline in capitalized internal product development costs also contributed to the increase in operating expense 
a decline in stock based compensation expense of million in partially offset the increase in compensation costs and other operating expenses 
cost of goods sold change change cost of goods sold of revenue pp pp gross profit gross margin pp pp cost of goods sold has generally been our largest category of operating expense  and that pattern continued in our business relies heavily on human capital  and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers 
cost of goods sold increased million in  which was mainly driven by higher bonus expense and other compensation related expense from increased headcount 
while compensation and bonus expense increased across all three of our business segments  the increase was more pronounced in our institutional segment because a larger portion of the headcount additions from recent acquisitions occurred in this segment 
acquisitions  primarily ibbotson  also contributed to the increase in cost of goods sold 
in  we recorded million of outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
costs for outsourced product implementation may or may not recur  depending on client requests for development projects in a given period 
our gross margin in increased to  compared with in  reflecting revenue growth that outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million in compensation expense increased in all three segments  but mainly reflects additional costs for newly hired stock analysts in our individual segment 
shareholder servicing fees related to morningstar managed portfolios  which increased because of higher assets under management  contributed million to the increase in cost of goods sold 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold declined by about percentage points in this partly reflects the timing of hiring expenses for our independent equity research 
we began incurring incremental compensation costs at the beginning of as we increased staffing in preparation for the ramp up of our equity research efforts 
we continued to increase staffing in  but had already completed the majority of the staffing increase in as a result  cost of goods sold increased less dramatically in because cost of goods sold declined as a percentage of revenue in  gross margin showed a corresponding increase 
gross margin has been steadily increasing over the past several years  to in from in development expense change change development expense of revenue pp pp development expense increased million in this increase was mainly driven by higher compensation costs  including incentive compensation and other compensation related expense 
we continued to increase hiring for our programming and development staff  and we also increased headcount in this area through acquisitions 
we had about programmers and other technology staff as of year end  compared with about at the end of because hiring and acquisitions both increased our cost base in this area  development expense increased as a percentage of revenue over levels 
development expense increased million in because of increased hiring for programming and development staff primarily in our advisor and institutional segments and a reduction in the amount of expense capitalized related to development projects 
we capitalize compensation costs associated with certain development projects  which reduces the costs included in development expense 
many of the projects for which we capitalized product development costs in have now been placed into service  and the ongoing costs are no longer capitalized 
instead  we expense these costs as incurred 
in  we capitalized million of development costs  compared with million in as a percentage of revenue  development expense was slightly lower in compared with sales and marketing expense change change sales and marketing expense of revenue pp pp sales and marketing expense increased million in more than a third of this increase was driven by added compensation expense from increased hiring for sales and marketing staff  mainly in our advisor and institutional segments 
higher incentive compensation and  to a lesser extent  commission expense and marketing costs  also drove the increase in this cost category 
incremental costs added by acquisitions also contributed to the growth in this category because of increases in headcount and the number of products and services sold 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense continued to decline as revenue growth outpaced the increase in cost  but less than in sales and marketing expense increased million in because of higher sales commissions  salaries  and benefits expense 
we incurred additional commission costs because of both increased sales volume  primarily in our advisor and institutional segments  and changes to the incentive structure for certain products in the advisor segment  including principia and advisor workstation office edition 
salaries and benefits included in this expense category also increased  mainly because of an increase in headcount for the sales and marketing team in our advisor segment 
because our revenue base increased at a faster pace than our sales and marketing expense  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined by about percentage points in general and administrative expense change change general and administrative expense of revenue pp pp general and administrative expense has generally been our second largest category of operating expense following cost of goods sold 
that pattern continued in  but general and administrative costs continued to decline as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative expense increased million in  mainly driven by increases in incentive compensation and incremental expense added by acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  which dropped because we did not record any stock based compensation expense under the liability method in in addition  legal expense was essentially flat in overall  most costs included in this category rose at a lower rate than revenue  and general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue declined by about percentage points in in  the million increase in general and administrative expense mainly included higher compensation costs  which increased primarily because we added staff in our corporate departments to meet the requirements of being a public company 
higher incentive compensation also contributed to the increase in this area in we also incurred million more for spending on corporate initiatives and legal fees related to regulatory investigations in than in in addition  we increased our offer to settle various claims related to morningstar research pty limited morningstar australia 
refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this litigation 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense decreased million in  which largely offset the increases in other areas 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was driven by a decline in expense for options accounted for under the liability method  as described below 
because our general and administrative expense increased at a slower pace compared with our revenue growth  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue declined by about percentage points in depreciation and amortization expense change change depreciation and amortization expense of revenue pp pp depreciation and amortization expense rose million in this increase was almost entirely driven by amortization expense from intangible assets acquired with ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
we expect that amortization of these intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets 
the increase in amortization expense was slightly offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for certain capitalized internal product development costs and computer equipment that are now fully depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly in primarily because of amortization of the intangible assets related to the vards acquisition 
this increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for capitalized software  computer equipment  and capitalized internal product development costs  as many of the assets in these categories are now fully depreciated 
stock based compensation expense the majority of our stock based compensation expense relates to employee stock option grants 
beginning in may  we began granting restricted stock units instead of stock options 
we have historically used two different methods of accounting for employee stock options the liability method  which involves recording a liability for vested options equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value per share of the common stock  and the equity method  which is based on the black scholes value of the option at the time of the grant and recorded over the vesting period of the option 
following our initial public offering in may  we are no longer required to settle stock options in cash  and therefore are no longer required to record stock based compensation expense under the liability method 
the following table summarizes our stock based compensation expense change change stock based compensation expense liability method stock based compensation expense equity method total stock based compensation expense of revenue pp pp total stock based compensation expense declined million in  largely because we did not record any stock based compensation expense under the liability method in stock based compensation expense recorded under the equity method increased  but by only a small amount 
an increase in expense related to our annual equity grant in may  which consisted of restricted stock units  was substantially offset by lower expense recorded for stock options granted in previous years  as certain options became fully vested and no longer require us to record additional expense 
in  we expect to record approximately million of stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards outstanding as of december  in  total stock based compensation expense declined million compared with stock based compensation expense recorded under the liability method declined million in the expense recorded under the liability method in reflects the expense recorded through the first quarter  when we adjusted the liability to reflect our initial public offering price of per share compared with a fair value of per share as of december  the expense recorded under the liability method in reflects a increase in the fair value per share of our common stock to per share as of december  from per share as of december  stock based compensation expense recorded under the equity method increased million in this increase mainly reflects the impact of approximately million options granted in  as well as ongoing expense associated with options granted in and prior years 
this increase was partially offset by lower expense for options granted in previous years  which are now fully vested and no longer require recording additional expense 
bonus expense change change bonus expense of revenue pp pp bonus expense recorded in increased million  with the increase driven by improved financial performance versus and incremental bonus expense from acquisitions 
we pay annual bonuses in proportion to our operating income 
we include bonus expense in each of our operating expense categories 
because the two factors mentioned above caused a substantial increase in the size of the bonus pool  bonus expense as a percentage of revenue increased by about percentage points in bonus expense increased million in this category of expense increased primarily because our financial performance in exceeded our financial performance in the impact of this increase was partially offset because our bonus expense in included a special bonus for our analyst team that did not recur in consolidated operating income change change operating income of revenue pp pp consolidated operating income increased million in despite incremental costs added by acquisitions  such as amortization of intangible assets and increased compensation related expense  our operating margin continued to improve because our revenue base expanded at a faster rate than operating expenses 
the lower rate of growth in general and administrative costs  in particular  allowed us to realize operating leverage in our consolidated results 
we also realized operating leverage from revenue growth in products that have had slower growing costs  such as investment consulting  advisor workstation  licensed data  and morningstar

our operating margin was also positively impacted by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense 

gbiijpg 
our operating margin increased more dramatically in this increase was primarily driven by the timing of revenue and expense associated with the global analyst research settlement  the million decrease in stock based compensation expense  and the operating leverage inherent in our business 
was the first full year of revenue from equity research associated with the global analyst research settlement 
in  we were able to increase costs associated with this revenue at a lower rate because much of the cost increases occurred in as we built our staff in anticipation of this revenue 
in addition  revenue growth for many of our institutional products  such as investment consulting and licensed data  increased during the year 
we were able to increase costs in most of the related expense categories at a lower rate than this revenue growth 
consolidated free cash flow we generated free cash flow of million in  reflecting cash provided by operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
free cash flow more than doubled compared with  primarily reflecting a million increase in cash provided by operating activities 
in addition  capital expenditures declined by approximately million compared with we spent less on leasehold improvements in after completing major build outs of our office space in london and china in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income  as well as a reduction in income tax payments and an increase in accrued compensation 
in  we paid million less for income taxes than we did in because of the cash tax benefits we received from the ibbotson acquisition 
free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was in  compared with in in  we generated free cash flow of million  reflecting cash provided by operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
free cash flow increased by million in  reflecting a million increase in cash provided by operating activities  which was driven by an increase in net income  as well as an approximately million reduction in capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenue  free cash flow was of revenue in  compared with in the decrease in capital expenditures in primarily reflects lower capitalized internal product development costs 
because several products for which costs were previously capitalized have now been put into service  we expense the ongoing costs as we incur them 
the table below presents a reconciliation between the increase in net income and the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities change change net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities non cash items included in net income changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions accrued compensation income taxes payable accounts receivable deferred revenue other cash provided by operating activities 
gbiijpg 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in outpaced the million increase in net income 
the increase in net income and a reduction in net operating assets and liabilities working capital excluding cash were the two main factors driving this trend 
the million reduction in working capital excluding cash was mainly caused by an increase in income taxes payable and accrued compensation 
the increase in income taxes payable reflects the increase in taxable income  mainly in the united states  and a million reduction in the amount of cash paid for income taxes in  as we were able to reduce income tax payments because of the cash tax benefits related to the cancellation of ibbotson s stock options 
the growth in accrued compensation reflects the increase in the size of the bonus liability partially offset by a million increase in the amount of cash paid for bonuses 
a reduction in non cash items included in net income partially offset these positive factors 
we anticipate making bonus payments of approximately million in the first quarter of  compared with million of bonus payments made in the first quarter of in  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million lagged the million increase in net income 
several items contributed to lower relative growth in cash provided by operating activities in income tax payments and bonus payments had the largest impact on the gap between cash provided by operating activities and net income 
income tax payments in increased million compared with the previous year 
in  we used the majority of our us net operating losses  reducing the amount of taxes paid 
bonus payments in increased million compared with  reflecting strong business performance during  as well as the last installment of a special bonus established for our analyst team in in addition  non cash items included in net income decreased primarily because of lower deferred income tax expense 
while income tax payments  bonus payments  and non cash items included in net income lowered our cash flow provided by operating activities  they were largely offset by a greater cash flow benefit in arising from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
more than half of this benefit reflects increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  the remaining increase was driven by accrued income taxes and accrued compensation  excluding the payments discussed above 
segment results change change revenue individual advisor institutional elimination of intersegment revenue consolidated revenue operating income individual advisor institutional corporate items and eliminations consolidated operating income operating margin individual pp pp advisor pp pp institutional pp pp consolidated operating margin pp pp individual segment our individual segment focuses on products and services for individual investors 
the largest product in this segment based on revenue is our us based web site  morningstar 
com  which includes both paid premium membership service and sales of internet advertising space 
our individual segment also includes morningstar equity research  which we distribute through several channels 
investors can access our equity research through our premium membership offering on morningstar 
com 
in addition  our equity research is distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the global analyst research settlement  as well as to several other companies who provide our research to their affiliated financial advisors or to individual investors

we sell several annual reference guides  including the morningstar funds  the morningstar stocks  the morningstar etfs  and the stocks  bonds  bills  and inflation yearbook 
since we acquired aspect huntley in july  this segment also includes several newsletters and other publications for australian investors 
also  with the addition of aspect huntley  our individual segment now includes revenue from both us and us operations 
in   and this segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 

gbiijpg 
in  revenue for the individual segment increased million compared with our acquisitions of aspect huntley and ibbotson contributed million to revenue  with aspect huntley contributing about of this incremental revenue 
in  our revenue increased million compared with  with all of the revenue growth generated organically 
excluding acquisitions  the product contributing the most to segment revenue in was morningstar 
com  which includes premium membership and internet advertising sales 
this product was the second largest driver of segment revenue growth during the number of subscriptions for morningstar 
com premium service has significantly expanded over the past three years to  as of december   compared with  as of december  and  as of december  in addition  consistent with the trend over the past few years  we moderately increased subscription prices for premium membership in both january and internet advertising sales growth was also strong in both years  increasing about in and in morningstar equity research  which mainly includes revenue related to the global analyst research settlement  was the second largest contributor to revenue growth in  and the largest driver in we began recognizing revenue for our equity research related to the settlement in july  which led to a favorable year over year comparison in in addition  we entered into an equity research agreement with a sixth investment bank involved in the settlement in september and began recognizing this new revenue in the fourth quarter of that year 
our revenue in this area also benefited in and because we ve continued to increase the number of stocks under coverage  leading to higher contract values for some of the agreements related to the settlement 
in  operating income for the individual segment increased million compared with  and in  operating income increased million compared with the increase in operating income in both years reflects revenue that grew at a faster rate than operating expense  though this leverage was more pronounced in the million and million of growth in operating expense in and  respectively  was mainly driven by higher compensation related expense  particularly in cost of goods sold 
hiring for our equity analyst team  whose compensation costs are included in cost of goods sold  contributed to this increase 
the team expanded to analysts worldwide as of december   compared with as of december  and as of december  an increase in bonus expense in as well as incremental expense added by acquisitions were also significant drivers of operating expense growth in that year 
bonus expense decreased in because this category included a special bonus for our analyst team in that did not recur in a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million in and million in partially offset expense increases in both years 
because our revenue grew at a faster pace than operating expense in both and  our operating margin improved percentage points in and percentage points in our margin improvement in was more significant partly because of a difference in the timing between revenue and expense associated with the global analyst research settlement 
beginning in  we invested heavily in the hiring of our analyst team in anticipation of the revenue associated with the settlement 
we began recognizing revenue from the settlement at the end of july this resulted in higher compensation related costs with no corresponding increase in revenue for the first seven months of in  however  we had a full year of revenue to cover costs 
as a result  operating margin significantly improved in compared with the decrease in stock based compensation expense in both and had a favorable impact on operating margins 
advisor segment our advisor segment focuses on products and services for financial advisors 
key products in this segment based on revenue are morningstar advisor workstation and morningstar principia 
advisor workstation is a web based investment planning system that provides financial advisors with a comprehensive set of tools for conducting their core business  including investment research  planning  and presentations 
advisor workstation is available in two editions the office edition for independent financial advisors and the enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms 
principia is our cd rom based investment research and planning software for financial advisors 
in addition  we offer morningstar managed portfolios  a fee based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund and exchange traded fund portfolios tailored to different investment time horizons and risk levels that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax deferred accounts 
following our acquisition of ibbotson  we began offering a series of nasd reviewed financial communications materials that advisors can use to educate clients about asset allocation and demonstrate other key investment concepts  as well as data and graphs that financial advisors can license for use in published materials 
following our acquisition of aspect huntley  this segment also includes investment conferences and software that we sell to financial planners and other market participants in australia 
in   and  this segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 

gbiijpg 
in  revenue for the advisor segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue in  primarily from sales of financial communications materials and advisor focused ibbotson software tools 
in  revenue for the advisor segment increased million compared with acquisitions had a smaller impact on revenue growth in  with our acquisition of vards contributing million 
in both and  the increase in revenue was primarily driven by morningstar advisor workstation 
we continued to see strong growth in licenses of the enterprise edition of morningstar advisor workstation  and we entered into numerous new agreements in both years 
in addition  we also experienced strong renewals for the product during and  and several contracts that were scheduled to expire renewed at significantly higher price points  reflecting both higher user counts and an increase in the amount of functionality licensed 
in  revenue from advisor workstation surpassed revenue from principia  which historically had been our largest product  to become our second largest product company wide  and it continued to hold this ranking in the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation increased to  as of december   compared with  as of december  and  as of december  morningstar managed portfolios also contributed to revenue growth in both and  but to a lesser degree than advisor workstation 
assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios increased to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  and million as of december  principia revenue remained flat in and declined slightly in the number of subscriptions for principia has been declining over the past few years to  as of december  from  as of december  and  as of december  while the number of subscriptions has decreased  average revenue per subscription increased in both years because of an increase in the number of higher priced advanced modules sold  previous price increases  and  in  reductions in certain discount programs 
in  operating income increased million compared with  and in  operating income increased million compared with in both years  the increase in operating income reflects an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating expense in all categories 
operating expense increased million and million  respectively  in and an increase in cost of goods sold was the biggest driver in both years  contributing almost half of the expense increase in and more than one third of the expense increase in higher cost of goods sold in both years partly reflects increased compensation costs from additional headcount 
in  an increase in bonus expense as well as incremental costs added by acquisitions were also major drivers behind the cost increase in this category 
in  an increase in shareholder servicing fees related to higher levels of assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios was a major contributor to higher cost of goods sold 
the remaining operating expense growth in primarily reflects an increase in sales and marketing expense  driven by compensation related expense  including bonuses 
incremental costs added by acquisitions also contributed to expense growth in all categories 
in  an increase in general and administrative expense  driven by higher corporate overhead expense  contributed a little less than one third of the increase in operating expense 
the remaining increase in operating expense in primarily reflects increased sales and marketing expense  which was driven by higher compensation related expense and commissions for sales of advisor workstation and principia 
the higher sales commissions reflect increased sales volume in advisor workstation and changes to the incentive structure for both products 
a decrease in stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  lowered operating expense in all categories and contributed to the improvement in operating income 
our operating margin improved by percentage points in  to  and percentage points in  to  reflecting the impact of higher revenue and our operating leverage 
operating margin growth in both years was partly driven by advisor workstation enterprise edition  revenue for this product has grown at a more rapid pace that operating expense 
a decrease in stock based compensation in and also had a positive impact on operating margins 
institutional segment our institutional segment focuses on products and services for institutions  including banks  insurance companies  mutual fund companies  brokerage firms  media firms  and retirement plan providers and sponsors 
key products and services in this segment based on revenue are investment consulting  which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds  including mutual funds and variable annuities  licensed data  a set of investment data spanning eight core databases  available through electronic data feeds  retirement advice  including the morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson platforms  morningstar direct  a web based institutional research platform that provides advanced research and tools on the complete range of securities in morningstar s global database  licensed tools and content  a set of online tools and editorial content designed for institutions to use in their web sites and software  investment profiles guides  which are designed for institutions to use in communicating investment information to individual investors  the morningstar annuity research center formerly vards online  and morningstar encorr  an asset allocation software package acquired with ibbotson 
with the addition of aspect huntley  this segment now includes financial information as well as other data feeds on australian stocks that we sell to stock brokers  information providers  and financial web sites 
the institutional segment also includes the hedge fund and separate account database division we acquired from investorforce in august in   and  this segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
we expect that the institutional segment will continue to account for the largest portion of our consolidated revenue for the foreseeable future 

gbiijpg 
in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million compared with acquisitions contributed million of revenue to this segment in  mainly from investment consulting services and encorr 
in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million compared with acquisitions increased revenue to a much lesser extent in  with vards contributing million in segment revenue during the year 
for the segment overall  the increase in revenue in both and was driven by investment consulting  which includes asset allocation and investment selection services for funds of funds and variable annuities 
investment consulting contributed about and of the total increase in segment revenue in and  respectively 
in  more than of the increase in investment consulting revenue was contributed by newly incorporated revenue from ibbotson 
in  we expanded existing relationships and our scope of responsibilities with two major clients 
in both and  revenue also increased because we receive asset based fees for our services  and assets under advisement in this area significantly increased in both years 
we provided advisory services on approximately billion in assets including billion from morningstar associates and billion from ibbotson associates as of december   compared with approximately billion in assets as of december  and approximately billion as of december  morningstar associates only 
these totals include consulting relationships as well as agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis point fee 
in addition  we also provide investment consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee 
excluding acquisitions  licensed data and morningstar direct were the next largest contributors to revenue growth in both and both products have benefited from expanded sales efforts in europe and other non us markets  as well as continued strength in the united states 
the number of licenses for morningstar direct increased to  worldwide as of december   compared with as of december  and as of december  revenue growth in morningstar direct in both and exceeded growth in the number of licenses because of the continued impact of a new pricing model implemented during several key contracts whose terms ended during and renewed for a smaller number of licenses  but at a greater price per license 
encorr and advice by ibbotson were also significant contributors to revenue growth during the ibbotson acquisition significantly expanded our asset base in managed retirement accounts  and we are now among the largest providers in this area 
we had billion in combined assets under management in the managed retirement accounts offered through advice by ibbotson billion and morningstar retirement manager million as of december   compared with million as of december  and million as of december  morningstar retirement manager only 
as of december   more than million retirement plan participants had access to our retirement advice services through approximately  plan sponsors and plan providers 
these totals include more than million retirement plan participants   plan sponsors and plan providers who had access to morningstar retirement manager  and nearly million retirement plan participants   plan sponsors and seven plan providers who had access to advice by ibbotson 
revenue for our online advice service for retirement plan participants declined in both and we have been transitioning clients to our new user interface  which gives retirement plan participants streamlined  easy to use access to a broader range of advisory services 
in particular  we are focusing our efforts on managed accounts  which may appeal to a broader segment of retirement plan participants 
revenue for the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager increased in both and  as assets under management more than doubled in both and in  operating income for the institutional segment increased million compared with  and in  operating income increased million compared with the increase in operating income in both years was primarily driven by revenue growth in investment consulting and licensed data 
contract values in both areas and asset based fees in investment consulting have increased  while the cost base for these services has increased at a lower rate 
operating expense increased approximately million in and million in in both years  the largest increase in expense was driven by cost of goods sold  which contributed about and of the expense increase in and  respectively 
in both years  incremental costs added by acquisitions also contributed to the increase in this expense category  but to a larger extent in during  we incurred approximately million of product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service 
in addition  a large portion of incremental headcount from acquisitions was added to the institutional segment in  which contributed to higher compensation and bonus expense in this category 
compensation related costs excluding acquisitions increased in both years because of added headcount and higher bonuses 
the remaining increase in operating expense in was spread across the other expense categories and reflects higher compensation and bonus expense as well as incremental expense added from acquisitions 
the remaining increase in operating expense in was driven by growth in sales and marketing expense  reflecting higher compensation and sales commission expense 
a decrease of million and million in stock based compensation expense in and  respectively  partially offset these expense increases  and in turn  positively impacted operating income 
our operating margin improved percentage points in and percentage points in  reflecting the impact of revenue growth that exceeded the increase in operating expense 
corporate and eliminations corporate items and eliminations include capitalized internal product development costs and related amortization expense 
in addition  this category includes amortization expense related to intangible assets  primarily recorded as part of acquisition related purchase price allocations 
the following table shows the components of corporate and eliminations expense income that impacted our consolidated operating income change change depreciation and amortization capitalized internal product development costs other nmf corporate items and eliminations in  corporate items and eliminations increased million primarily because of an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets we acquired with ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
in  corporate items and eliminations increased million  reflecting a decrease of million in capitalized internal product development costs and a million increase in depreciation and amortization 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  non operating income  and income tax expense equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities primarily includes our portion of the net income loss of morningstar japan kk mjkk  morningstar korea  ltd  morningstar danmark a s  and morningstar sweden ab 
in both and  equity in net income of unconsolidated entities increased primarily because of an increase in equity earnings from mjkk 
in addition  in  mjkk recorded a gain related to the sale of shares in a subsidiary s initial public offering 
our share of the pre tax gain was approximately million 
for more information about our investments in unconsolidated entities  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income the following table presents the components of net non operating income interest income  net other income expense  net non operating income net interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio 
net interest income increased million and million during and  respectively  because of increases in cash  cash equivalents  and investments  as well as higher returns on invested cash balances 
other income expense  net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our non us operations  unrealized and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio  and royalty income from mjkk 
the increase in other expense  net in was primarily related to foreign currency exchange losses  particularly with regard to the euro 
income tax expense the following table summarizes the components of our effective income tax expense rate income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities total income tax expense effective income tax expense rate for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate to our effective tax rate  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our effective income tax rate is influenced by three primary factors the reported income or loss of our non us entities and our evaluation of the realizability of their net operating losses  incentive stock options  and the impact of specific tax planning strategies 
in  our effective income tax rate was  which is comparable to our effective income tax rate in this rate  however  reflects three items related to our non us operations 
our effective income tax rate includes additional income tax expense outside the united states recorded in the second quarter of this additional income tax expense increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in addition  in we paid withholding taxes in non us jurisdictions for which we do not anticipate receiving a credit for us income tax purposes 
these withholding taxes increased our effective rate by approximately a half of a percentage point 
these increases were mostly offset by the benefit we recorded as a result of reducing previously recorded deferred tax valuation allowances 
based on the evidence related to certain of our non us entities  we concluded it was more likely than not that we would be able to use the accumulated net operating losses 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations 
because of the historical operating losses of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of these nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the valuation allowances and non us tax related items 
in  our effective income tax expense rate decreased compared with prior years  primarily because of a reduction in the tax impact related to incentive stock options 
for incentive stock options  we record stock based compensation expense but we do not record a corresponding tax benefit 
this had the impact of increasing our effective income tax rate above the us federal rate of 
the amount of incentive stock option expense recorded in was lower than the amounts recorded in  reflecting the fact that  subsequent to our initial public offering  incentive stock options are no longer accounted for under the liability method  and because they are fully vested  no stock based compensation expense was recorded for these options during the last nine months of our effective tax rate also reflects an increase in the number of disqualifying dispositions related to incentive stock options 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option 
we receive a tax benefit when a disqualifying disposition occurs 
our income tax expense also reflects a benefit of million related to research and development expenses due to a change in us income tax regulations 
this benefit resulted in a one time reduction of our effective income tax expense rate 
in the fourth quarter of  we formalized cost sharing agreements among our operations to more accurately reflect the economic sharing arrangements that benefit our subsidiaries 
this also had the effect of lowering our taxes in certain jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including working capital  and for funding future growth 
cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million compared with the balance as of december  the increase primarily reflects million in cash provided by operating activities and million in cash provided by financing activities  partially offset by million in cash used for investing activities 
in addition to the million of cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had million of investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  an increase of million from december  
gbiijpg 
cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
the increase of million  or  in operating cash flows mainly reflects increases in net income  income taxes payable  and accrued compensation 
in  we made million of income tax payments  compared with million in as part of the ibbotson purchase price allocation  we recorded a reduction to income taxes payable of million 
this income tax benefit  primarily related to the payments for the cancellation of ibbotson s stock options  was fully used during  reducing the amount we paid for income taxes 
this cash income tax benefit did not impact our income tax expense or net income in we will not receive additional cash tax benefits from the ibbotson acquisition  and therefore  our income taxes payable has increased in anticipation of future payments 
accrued compensation increased primarily because of an increase in accrued bonuses 
in february  we made approximately million of bonus payments that were accrued as of december  in  we made bonus payments of million 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million  or  to million 
the increase in operating cash flows during primarily reflects an increase in net income and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities  excluding income tax and bonus payments 
in  we made income tax payments of million 
in  we made only million of income tax payments because of the us net operating loss carryforwards available from prior years 
in and  we paid bonuses of approximately million and million  respectively 
the higher bonuses paid in were the result of strong operating performance and the last installment of a special bonus paid to our analyst team in connection with the ramp up of our independent equity research business 
excluding the impact of income tax and bonus payments  our net operating assets and liabilities decreased primarily because of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  accrued bonuses related to the current year s performance  and accrued income taxes 
the increase in accounts receivable  resulting primarily from higher client billings  was partially offset by the related increase in deferred revenue 
because we frequently invoice our customers and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions  we often have significant deferred revenue  which is shown as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and december   our deferred revenue was million including deferred revenue from acquisitions and million  respectively 
in  we began participating in voluntary disclosure or similar programs related to state sales tax 
we estimated our total liability for these taxes to be approximately million 
beginning in through the end of  we made total cash payments of million in conjunction with these voluntary disclosure programs 
the remaining amount expected to be due in connection with these voluntary disclosure programs is recorded as an accrued liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  and capital expenditures 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million compared with  primarily reflecting an increase in cash used for acquisitions 
in  cash used for investing activities decreased million from primarily reflecting a decrease in purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments 
this decrease in cash used was partially offset by cash outflows related to the january acquisition of vards 
cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
this total includes cash used to purchase ibbotson in march  aspect huntley in july  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce in august in  cash used for acquisitions was million  related to our january acquisition of vards 
in  cash used for acquisitions was million  related to our february purchase of the remaining of morningstar norge as morningstar norway that we did not previously own 
purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of million and million  respectively 
as of both december  and  our investments represented approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures are primarily for leasehold improvements  computer hardware  and capitalized internal product development costs 
in  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million primarily for computer hardware to support our technology platforms and the build out of new office space for our non us operations 
in addition  we may also spend up to million in capital expenditures for the build out of our new corporate headquarters in chicago  depending on the progress of construction of the new building 
cash provided by used for financing activities in  cash provided by financing activities of million increased million  or  and primarily reflected proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
stock option exercises continued to increase in  our first full year as a public company 
we also recognized million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january   the new standard requires that we record excess tax benefits from stock option exercises as a financing activity  instead of as an operating activity 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
in  cash provided by financing activities increased million  reflecting net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in may these proceeds resulted from the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option based on our initial public offering price of per share  after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately million of offering expenses 
we also received proceeds of million from stock option exercises in  compared with only million in stock option exercises increased in following our initial public offering 
in march  we repaid a million promissory note payable to joe mansueto  our chairman  chief executive officer  and controlling shareholder 
the obligation and related interest were paid in full 
acquisitions institutional hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce  inc in august  we acquired the institutional hedge fund and separate account database division of investor force  inc  a financial software and data integration company based in wayne  pennsylvania  for million in cash  including transaction related costs

we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling of our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired companies that complement our business operations 
in  we acquired ibbotson associates  aspect huntley  and the database division of investorforce 
the total cash paid for these acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million in in  we acquired vards for million in cash 
in  we acquired the remaining of morningstar norway that we did not previously own for million in cash and million in other consideration 
for each of these acquisitions  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we recognized the assets and liabilities acquired related to these acquisitions at their estimated fair values including million of value assigned to intangible assets such as customer lists  intellectual property  technology  non competition agreements  and supplier lists 
for these intangible assets  the estimated useful lives range from three to years 
as of december   we also have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
we use judgment to identify the acquired assets  estimate the fair value of these assets  estimate the useful life of the assets  and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset s useful life 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 
goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to at least an annual test for impairment  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates annually  at a minimum 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  equipment  and capitalized software of million and intangible assets of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include a deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r as of january  under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
in  we granted both stock options and restricted stock units to employees 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
we measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of our stock options required that we make several estimates  including the volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the option  the expected strike price at the time of exercise  interest rates  and dividend yields 
as a recently public company  we have limited historical information on the price of our stock as well as employees stock option exercise behavior 
because of this limitation  we cannot rely on our historical experience alone to develop assumptions for stock price volatility and the expected life of our options 
we estimated stock price volatility with reference to a peer group of companies 
determining the companies to include in this peer group involves judgment 
we estimated the expected life of our options using the shortcut method described in staff accounting bulletin topic d  which is based on a calculation to arrive at the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
certain stock options granted in   and have initial exercise prices that will increase over the term of the options at a rate equal to the year treasury bond rate as of the date of grant 
we estimated the expected exercise price included in the black scholes model using our estimated year estimated life and the applicable year treasury bond rate 
we based the risk free interest rate used in our assumptions on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term that approximates the stock option award s expected life 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future  therefore  we used a dividend yield of zero in our assumptions 
the use of different assumptions in the black scholes model would result in different amounts of stock based compensation expense 
a change in the black scholes value would have resulted in a corresponding change of approximately million in stock based compensation expense in for stock options 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
rather  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our annual effective income tax expense rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us entities which are part of our consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of december   we had million of net current deferred tax liabilities and million of net long term deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations 
of these nols  million will begin to expire in through and million have no expiration 
because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets and nols  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  we establish reserves at the time that we determine that it is more likely than not that we will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is more likely than not 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations 
refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties  including  but not limited  to court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
judgment is required as we assess the probability of loss for such contingencies and either accrue a liability or disclose the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years  therefore  we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   therefore  we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure for uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   therefore  we will adopt fin in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences eitf no 
 which requires that a liability for employees sabbatical benefits be accrued over the period required for employees to earn the right to sabbatical leave 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   therefore  we will adopt eitf no 
in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we will record a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  of approximately million to record the portion of employee sabbatical leave that has been earned 
other than recording this cumulative effect of accounting change  we do not anticipate that the adoption of eitf no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table presents our known contractual obligations as of december  and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations thereafter total minimum commitments on non cancelable operating lease obligations asset retirement obligation total the non cancelable operating lease obligations relate primarily to lease commitments on office space 
in december  we signed an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of new office space for our corporate headquarters in chicago  illinois 
the lease begins in and has a term of years 
the minimum future lease payments are included in the table presented above 
the asset retirement obligation relates to costs that will be incurred to return office space modified by leasehold improvements to its original condition in accordance with the lease agreement 
in addition  we have an obligation to pay up to approximately million under a deferred compensation agreement with don phillips  one of our managing directors  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   million is classified as a current liability and million is classified as a long term liability 
we are required to make these payments as don exercises certain stock options granted to him under the stock option plan 
because the timing of these payments is uncertain  we have not included this obligation in the above table 
in may  don entered into a rule b plan contemplating the sale of up to  shares to be acquired through stock option exercises during and as of december   there were  options remaining to be exercised under this b plan 
if all  stock options are exercised in  we would make payments to him of approximately  in accordance with the deferred compensation agreement 
there are no purchase commitments as of december  that we believe would have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be subject to risk from fluctuating interest rates 
our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses due to fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
at december   we held million of investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases  fluctuation in foreign currencies is an increasing potential risk 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
