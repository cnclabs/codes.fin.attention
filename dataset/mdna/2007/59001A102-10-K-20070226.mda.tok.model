item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer and builder of single family homes in the rapidly growing western and southern united states  based on the number of home closings and revenue 
we focus on providing a broad range of first time  move up  active adult and luxury homes to our targeted customer base 
we believe that the relatively strong population  job and income growth as well as the favorable migration characteristics of our markets will continue to provide significant long term growth opportunities for us 
at december   we were actively selling homes in communities  with base prices ranging from  to  we operate in the following geographic regions  which are presented as our reportable business segments west california and nevada central arizona  texas and colorado east florida we achieved record home closings and revenue in home closing revenue increased in to billion  however  net earnings decreased to million due primarily to million of inventory impairments and write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs 
in we closed  homes  up from  while new orders received of  were down from during the latter half of  our markets experienced significant declines in orders due to the weakened homebuilding market and high cancellation rates 
this decline in net orders contributed to the decrease of units in backlog and decrease of backlog value at december  as compared to the prior year 
at december   we had a backlog of  homes with a value of approximately billion 
our lower backlog reflects the slowdown the homebuilding industry as a whole experienced in in  we received  net new orders valued at billion  decreases of and  respectively  compared to  due to a slower sales pace in from the weakened homebuilding market  coupled with higher cancellation rates 
cancellation rates were of gross unit sales in as compared to in during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a continued slowdown in our markets in the pace of new orders compounded by increased cancellations when compared to the abnormally high level of orders in the fourth quarter of  resulting in decreases in the number of homes ordered of and in the value of those orders 
it is our expectation that during cancellation rates will begin to trend toward historical average levels of less than 
during january  demand continued to moderate from the prior year s pace of sales orders 
we believe our experiences are consistent with the overall trends in the homebuilding market 
in addition  we are offering our customers increased incentives and discounts to remain competitive in the currently weak market 
our strategy and other recent developments in general  we focus on minimizing land risk by purchasing property only after full entitlements have been obtained and typically begin development or construction immediately after close 
we acquire land primarily through rolling option contracts  allowing us to purchase individual lots as our building needs dictate 
these arrangements allow us to control lot inventory typically on a non recourse basis without incurring the risks of land ownership 
at december   we owned or had options to acquire approximately  housing lots  of which approximately were under option and land purchase contracts 
we believe that the lots we own or have the right to acquire represent an approximate four to five year supply  and that we are well positioned for future growth 
on february   we completed the sale of an aggregate principal amount of million of senior subordinated notes due in a private placement 
the notes were issued at par and resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deduction of fees  commmissions and expenses 
we used the proceeds from the sale of these senior subordinated notes to paydown our revolving credit facility 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our inability to accurately estimate stock based compensation  expenses  accruals  or an impairment of real estate or goodwill could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
the estimates and assumptions we make relating to our application of fin r  if not accurate  could result in us incorrectly including  or excluding  certain contractual land acquisition arrangements or investments in unconsolidated entities as variable interest entities in  or from  respectively  our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include revenue recognition in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize revenue from home sales when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
real estate real estate is stated at cost and includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community 
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual lots on a relative value basis 
the costs of these lots are transferred to homes under construction when construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community are allocated on a relative value basis to the remaining homes in the community 
when a home is closed  we may have not yet paid all costs incurred to complete it 
at the time of close  we record a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid to complete the home 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present 
sfas no 
requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows projected for those assets are less than their carrying amounts  impairment charges are to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates  including future sales prices  construction costs and absorption rates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis 
our analysis is completed at community level  therefore  changes in local conditions may effect one of several of our communities 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our real estate inventories 
additionally  we wrote off million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer feasible 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our operations in each state are considered a reporting unit 
the fair value of reporting units is determined using various valuation methodologies  including discounted future cash flow models and enterprise value computations 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
if goodwill is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds implied fair value of that goodwill 
inherent in our fair value determinations are certain judgements and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of our analysis  which could cause the fair value of one or more reporting units to be less than their respective carrying amounts 
in addition  to the extent that there are significant changes in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our goodwill has been assigned to reporting units in different geographic locations 
therefore  potential goodwill impairment charges resulting from changes in local market and or local economic conditions or changes in our strategic plans may be isolated to one or a few of our reporting units 
however  a widespread decline in the homebuilding industry or a significant deterioration of general economic conditions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of several or all of our reporting units 
while we believe that no goodwill impairment existed as of december   future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or poor performance in either the national economy or individual local economies  could lead to impairment of goodwill in future periods 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our contracts generally require subcontractors to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are generally responsible for such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover potential costs for materials and labor as they relate to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are determined based upon the company s and industry wide historical data and trends with respect to product types and geographical areas 
at december   our warranty reserve was million 
while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because the criteria for consolidation set forth in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
we use our business judgement to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of  or have a controlling interest in  an unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include the profit loss sharing terms of the entity  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
as of december   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not have a controlling interest  and our ownership interest exceeds 
at december   the unconsolidated entitites in which we had equity investments had total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our investments in unconsolidated entities 
we also enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots from entities  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we analyze these agreements under fin r to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined created as result of these agreements using a model developed by management 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie because we are obligated to absorb the majority of the expected losses  receive the majority of the residual returns  or both  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we assess our ability to realize deferred tax assets primarily based on earnings history  future earnings potential  the reversal of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be fully realized and does not require a valuation allowance 
share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock nonvested shares outstanding under two stock compensation plans 
per the terms of these plans  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
no options granted under the plans may be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
thereafter  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
prior to january   we accounted for stock option awards granted under our compensation plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
share based employee compensation expense was not recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to january   as our stock options had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and therefore  no intrinsic value 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  our compensation expense recorded in includes both charges related to the vesting of options and restricted stock granted since the adoption of sfas no 
r as well as compensation cost related to the unvested portions of options granted prior to january  for all compensation cost recorded  fair value of the options was determined using the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgements 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding

companywide 
home closing revenue increased to a company record of billion in from billion in the factor primarily leading to this increase was the strong demand and pricing power relating to sales orders  which were realized in the closings 
average selling prices on homes closed rose from to and we benefited from an increase in the number of homes closed in to  from  in home closing revenue increased to a company record of billion in from billion in the factors primarily leading to this increase were continued strong demand and our ability to raise prices throughout many of our markets 
average selling prices on homes closed rose from to and we benefited from a increase in the number of homes closed in to  from  in additionally  our two acquisitions in florida  though only included in our results for less than one year  accounted for approximately of our increase in home closing revenues in west 
in  the west region experienced a revenue decline 
as some markets in the western united states were first to feel the impacts of the downturn in the housing markets  closings in in both dollars and volume reflect our reduced pricing power and high cancellations  particularly in california 
the decrease in california home closing revenue to million in compared to million in reflects a decrease in the number of homes closed and a decrease in the average selling price of homes closed 
in nevada  strong sales performance in early resulted in the number of homes closed increasing in  producing home closing revenue of million  an increase of compared to in  the west region experienced revenue growth to billion as compared to million in the strong performance of the west region in was primarily attributed to exceptionally high demand and pricing power as reflected in the number of closings and increased average sales price 
the increase in california home closing revenue to million in compared to million in reflected a increase in the number of homes closed and a increase in the average selling price of homes closed 
in nevada  the number of homes closed increased in  producing home closing revenue of million  an increase of compared to central 
in  sales mix and strong orders were the primary drivers behind the overall increased results in the central region 
home closing revenue increased to billion as compared to billion in both arizona and texas had a year of record closings  with  and  homes closed  respectively  increases of and over additionally  average sales price increases of and  respectively  in arizona and texas in as compared to further contributed to the year s strong performance 
in  healthy demand and pricing power resulted in strong results in the central region 
home closing revenue increased to billion as compared to billion in in arizona  home closing revenue increased million  due to increases of and in the number of homes closed and average sales price  respectively 
these strong results reflected the pricing power and limited homes inventory availability in this local market during in a very competitive texas market  where we expanded our entry level and semi custom luxury offerings in addition to our primary focus on move up homes  we closed  homes in for million in revenue  increases of and  respectively 
east 
during  we closed homes  generating revenue of million 
the increase in revenue is due to both increased volume and the higher average sales price of  as compared to  in in  as a result of our two acquisitions and the commencement of closings in our orlando start up division  we produced home closing revenue of million on home closings 
home orders 
companywide 
home orders for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include orders contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate of less than of gross sales  although our rate in was 
in  we took home orders for  homes  a decrease of compared to the  home orders in primarily due to the decline in demand in many of our homebuilding markets  partially offset by home sales at new communities  which increased by to actively selling communities at december  in  we took home orders for  homes  an increase of compared to the  home orders in primarily due to strong demand for homes in most of our markets and a increase in the number of actively selling communities to at december  west 
our west region posted significantly weaker order volume in  decreasing in the value of home orders  with our fourth quarter order value for this region also falling  reflecting the continued slowing from the unusually robust sales pace seen in previous years in these markets 
we expect home order rates to return to more normal and sustainable levels in late or early as market conditions adjust and cancellation rates stabilize to more typical levels 
our west region posted strong order growth in  increasing in the value of home orders and in the number of homes ordered 
however  our fourth quarter order value for this region fell year over year  reflecting the start of the slowing trend in the homebuilding market as a whole and this region in particular 
central 
in  a weaker housing market in the arizona region contributed to a decrease in the value of home orders in arizona 
while average sales price per home held steady due to changes in sales mix offsetting price decreases  the number of home orders declined  to  for the region  reflecting the deterioration in the local market from the strong demand a year earlier 
in texas  despite a very competitive market  we experienced solid demand in all of our markets and received orders for  homes valued at billion in  increases of and  respectively  compared to  home orders with a value of million in additionally  the central region increased its number of actively selling communities to as of december   as compared to a year ago  also offsetting slower sales and high cancellations 
in  the central region experienced a increase in the value of home orders as compared to the increase was primarily due to particularly strong results in arizona 
the value of home orders in arizona rose in due  in part  to a increase in the number of actively selling communities and the diversification of our product offerings 
we were able to take advantage of emerging demographic trends such as maturing baby boomers in the form of active adult communities 
east 
in  the number of home sales in florida decreased by orders to units worth million  a and decrease over this decrease is due to the extremely difficult market conditions in ft 
myers naples  where demand and pricing power have declined at a faster pace than the rest of the nation 
we expect these conditions to continue in order backlog 
companywide 
our backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
our backlog was billion at december   a decrease of compared to billion at december  and was comprised of  homes  a decrease compared to december  our homes in backlog at december  reflect an average sales price of  a decrease of compared to  at the same time a year ago 
these decreases are primarily the result of declining housing markets in many of our markets  as reflected by decreased pricing power and higher cancellation rates  coupled with record closings in our backlog was billion at december   an increase of compared to billion at december  and was comprised of  homes  a increase compared to the year ended december  our homes in backlog at december  reflected an average sales price of  an increase of compared to  at the same time a year ago 
these increases were primarily due to healthy housing markets in many of our markets 
west 
in  the west region experienced a decrease in dollar backlog as compared to in california  we had a decrease in the dollar value of backlog of  reflecting weaker demand in the fourth quarter  while nevada s backlog units represent an decrease over the prior year 
as previously noted  record high cancellation rates were a primary factor causing the reduced backlog 
in  the west region experienced a increase in dollar backlog as compared to in california  we had a modest increase in the dollar value of backlog of  reflecting moderating demand in the fourth quarter  while nevada s homes represented a increase over the prior year 
central 
as of december   the central region had  homes in backlog  a decrease of over in arizona  the number of homes in backlog decreased and the value of those homes decreased 
these results were partially offset by texas  where homes in backlog increased to  from  at december  with an increase of in value to million 
as of december   the central region had  homes in backlog  an increase of over in arizona  the number of homes in backlog increased and the value of those homes increased  while in texas  homes in backlog increased to  from  at december  with an increase of in value to million 
east 
we ended with homes in backlog in florida with a value of million  decreases of and  respectively  from the poor homebuilding market conditions and high cancellation rates  particularly in ft 
myers naples  were the main cause for these declines 
other operating information years ended december  in thousands home closing gross profit west home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue central home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue east home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue total home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue home closing gross profit 
companywide 
home closing gross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings 
cost of home closings include land and lot development costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  impact fees  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
our companywide gross profit of is basis points below our gross profit of 
our gross profit included real estate inventory impairments and write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs of million  which is of total home closing revenue 
excluding such charges  our and margins are relatively comparable as many of the closings reflect the favorable pricing conditions of  when many of these homes were sold 
west 
for  home closing gross profit decreased basis points over to 
the margins reflect our declining pricing power and increased use of incentives in  coupled with home construction costs holding steady when compared to the robust homebuilding environment of margins in were further impacted by inventory impairments and write downs of options and pre acquisition costs 
the west region recorded million of impairment and write downs  reducing the gross profit margin by 
as we expected  our homebuilding margins were not sustainable  and we believe our margins will continue to decline to more historical average levels 
we believe that further margin compression could result from a continued slowing in home sale price increases or decreases in home sale prices  increasing costs of land and building materials and the offering of increased incentives to homebuyers if the homebuilding market slows and interest rates increase 
home closing gross profit increased basis points in over to 
the margins reflected an overall robust homebuilding environment and were above our target range 
this increase was primarily due to strong demand in and our ability to increase prices in many of our markets at that time  while cost containment efforts of our land and construction costs further contributed to the increase 
central 
the central region experienced a basis point increase in gross profit percentage in to as compared to this increase is due primarily to the mix of homes sold in arizona  with higher margin communities contributing a larger percentage of the sales 
the central region also recorded million of impairments and write downs as discussed above 
the central region experienced a basis point increase in gross profit percentage in to as compared to due to the strong homebuilding environment and cost management efforts of our land and construction costs 
east 
the east region had home closing profit of during the basis point decline is due to both the inventory impairments recorded during  as well as the weakened homebuilding market  particularly in ft 
myers naples  where significant price concessions and sales incentives were utilized in order to remain competitive in the local market 
total impairments and write downs aggregated to million during  of the region s home closing revenue for the year 
years ended december  in thousands commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total closing revenue provision for income taxes dollars percent of earnings before provision for income taxes commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  increased as a percent of home closing revenue to in from in this increase was primarily due to the weakened housing markets  which resulted in the increased involvement of external real estate agents who are paid a higher commission than our internal sales force  and additional sales and marketing efforts targeted at improving our competitiveness in this challenging market 
commissions and other sales costs as a percent of home closing revenue were in  down from in this decrease was primarily the result of our ability to leverage our fixed and semi fixed sales and marketing costs with our increase in home closing revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue in from in the increase is primarily attributed to million pre tax of charges related to severance costs and stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  which contributed an additional basis points 
during we completed two acquisitions in florida 
these acquisitions  along with our growth in our existing markets  necessitated an expansion of our corporate infrastructure capabilities  such as accounting  internal audit  human resources  legal and information technology to prudently manage the growth of the company 
this expansion resulted in an increase in general and administrative cost to of total revenue compared to for loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to our bond refinancing  the proceeds of which were used to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  down from in the slight decrease in is primarily attributed to an increase in the deduction related to qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  a reduction in the amount of non deductible executive incentive compensation  and the impact of incentive stock options under sfas no 
r  which was implemented at the beginning of income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  up from in this increase was mainly due to the increase in pre tax earnings in arizona and california  which have higher state tax rates than nevada and texas 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable for by approximately million  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital for the year ended december  were for operating expenses  land purchases  investments in joint ventures  lot development  home construction  the repurchase of common stock  income taxes and interest 
we used a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
cash flows during the later stages of a community may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of closings includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
we enter into various option and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
except for a minor number of our specific performance options  none of these agreements require us to purchase lots 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
although the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  during a weakened homebuilding market  as we are currently experiencing  we may be required to purchase lots at an absorption level that exceeds our sales pace in order to maintain the pre established purchase rate 
at december   we had entered into option purchase contracts with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note variable interest entities and consolidated real estate not owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
unsecured revolving credit facility on may   we amended and restated our senior unsecured revolving credit facility amended credit agreement 
under the amended credit agreement  our credit facility was increased from million to million  and the term was extended from may to may on june   we amended our credit agreement to increase our borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by million and to make certain other minor changes 
the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility is now million 
the increase in capacity was made pursuant to an accordion feature contained in the credit agreement 
this accordion feature allows us to request from time to time an aggregate increase of up to million in the maximum borrowing commitment 
each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request we make 
in addition  any increase in the borrowing capacity pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions  including the absence of an event of default 
at december   million was available under the accordion feature 
at december   million was outstanding under our amended credit agreement and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase and other contracts 
after considering our most restrictive bank covenants  our borrowing availability under the amended credit agreement was approximately million at december   as determined by borrowing base limitations defined by our agreement with the lending banks 
on february   we completed the sale of an aggregate principal amount of million of senior subordinated notes due in a private placement 
the notes were issued at par and resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deduction of fees  commmissions and expenses 
we used the proceeds from the sale of these senior subordinated notes to paydown our revolving credit facility 
this credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million plus of net income earned since january  plus of the aggregate net increase in tangible net worth resulting from the sale of capital stock and other equity interests as defined  prohibiting our ratio of indebtedness including accrued expenses to tangible net worth from being greater than to requiring us to maintain a ratio of ebitda including interest amortized to cost of sales to interest incurred as defined of at least to  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced to exceed of tangible net worth and prohibiting the net book value of our raw land where grading or infrastructure improvements have not begun to exceed of tangible net worth  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter as follows unsold homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and model homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and prohibiting us from entering into any sale and leaseback transaction  excluding the sale and leaseback of model homes 
senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the indenture for our senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facility  most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
senior notes in march  we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indenture that governs our existing senior notes  except that  among other things  the new indenture does not require us to maintain a certain level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness is unlimited  and with respect to other indebtedness is million  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the new indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the new senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior note covenants 
although we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand and anticipated net cash flows from operations are and will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  certain events may occur  particularly in light of the current slowdown of the homebuilding market  which may require additional cash outlays beyond our historical levels 
such events include the acquisition of land from our lots under option at a rate faster than our sales pace and the build up of unsold inventory due to high cancellation rates 
we believe our future cash needs will include funds for the completion of projects that are underway  the acquisition of land and property for new projects  repurchases of common stock 
the maintenance of our day to day operations  and the acquisition or start up of additional homebuilding operations  should the opportunities arise 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 
see part ii  item for additional discussions regarding our share repurchase program 
off balance sheet arrangements we often acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements 
this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
under these purchase agreements  we are usually required to make deposits in the form of cash or a letter of credit  which may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
at december   we had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion and had made deposits of approximately million in the form of cash and approximately million in letters of credit 
we also enter into land acquisition and development joint ventures 
we believe our participation in such joint ventures provides us a means of accessing larger parcels and lot positions and helps us expand our market opportunities and manage our risk profile 
our participation in joint ventures is an increasingly important part of our business model and we expect it to continue to be in the future 
we and or our joint venture partners occasionally provide limited repayment guarantees on a pro rata basis on debt of certain unconsolidated land acquisition and development joint ventures 
at december   we had limited repayment guarantees of million 
in addition  we and or our joint venture partners occasionally provide guarantees that are only applicable if and when the joint venture directly  or indirectly through agreement with its joint venture partners or other third parties  causes the joint venture to voluntarily file a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action commonly referred to as bad boy guarantees 
these types of guarantees typically are on a pro rata basis and are designed to protect the secured lender from the joint venture filing voluntary bankruptcy to impede the lender s remedies with respect to its mortgage or other secured lien on the joint venture s underlying property 
to date  no such guarantees have been invoked and we believe it is unlikely that such a guarantee would be invoked in the future as it would generally require us to voluntarily take actions that would generally be disadvantageous to the joint venture and to us 
at december   we had outstanding guarantees of this type totaling approximately million 
by definition  guarantees of this type  unless invoked as described above  are not considered guarantees or indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures 
we and our joint venture partners are also typically obligated to the project lenders to complete land development improvements if the joint venture does not perform the required development 
provided we and the other joint venture partners are in compliance with these completion obligations  the project lenders generally would be obligated to fund these improvements through any financing commitments available under the applicable joint venture development and construction loans 
in addition  we and our joint venture partners have from time to time provided unsecured environmental indemnities to joint venture project lenders 
in some instances  these indemnities are subject to caps 
these indemnities generally obligate us to reimburse the project lenders only for claims related to environmental matters for which such lenders are held responsible 
as part of our project acquisition due diligence process to determine potential environmental risks  we  or the joint venture entity  generally obtain an independent environmental review from outside consultants 
additionally  we and our joint venture partners have agreed to indemnify third party surety providers with respect to performance bonds issued on behalf of certain of our joint ventures 
if a joint venture does not perform its obligations  the surety bond could be called 
if these surety bonds are called and the joint venture fails to reimburse the surety  we and our joint venture partners would be obligated to indemnify the surety 
these surety indemnity arrangements are generally joint and several obligations with our other joint venture partners 
as of december   we were subject to approximately million of these types of surety bond indemnity arrangements 
none of these bonds have been called to date and we believe it is unlikely that any of these bonds will be called 
we also obtain letters of credit and performance  maintenance  and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies depending on the stage and level of our development activities 
in the event the letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million in performance bonds for such purposes 
we believe it is unlikely that any of these letters of credit or performance bonds will be drawn upon 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal  senior notes interest  senior notes unsecured revolving credit facility other borrowing obligations interest  other borrowing obligations operating lease obligations specific performance option obligations total as a part of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties  the monthly payments for which are typically calculated by applying a libor based rate to the agreed upon basis of the leased asset 
as discussed in note  at december  and  approximately and million of these transactions were included in our balance sheet as model home inventory with a corresponding debt balance  which is included in the other borrowings category above 
other payments relating to the model home leases and other operating leases are included in the operating lease obligations category 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
includes million in principal related to an acquisition and development loan with interest payments totaling approximately  we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or seasonality we typically experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirement 
historically  we sell more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half  which results in more working capital requirements and home closings in the third and fourth quarters 
we expect this seasonal pattern to continue  although it may vary as our operations continue to expand

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and libor lending rates 
at december   we had million drawn under our revolving credit facility that would be subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes and million in principal of our senior notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the year ended december  follows december  for the years ended december  fair value at december  thereafter total dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a variable rate b c b d average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
b and million relates to our model home lease program in and although we have no legal obligation to repay this amount  generally accepted accounting principles require we include this liability and a related asset in our consolidated financial statements 
the lease payments required under this program are based on the outstanding principal amount at approximately of such amount per annum 
c million relates to an acquisition and development loan which carries a variable interest rate of the day libor plus per annum 
d million relates to our revolving credit facility which carries a variable interest rate of libor plus per annum or prime 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
