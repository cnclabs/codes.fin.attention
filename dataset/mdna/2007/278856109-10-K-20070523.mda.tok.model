as provided in the explanatory note at the beginning of this form k and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has restated its financial results as a result of the completed review of eclipsys stock option grant practices and related accounting adjustments 
overview eclipsys is a healthcare information technology company and a leading provider of advanced integrated information software  clinical content and professional services that help healthcare organizations improve clinical  financial  and operational process 
we develop and license proprietary software and content that is designed for use in connection with many of the key clinical  administrative and financial functions that healthcare organizations require 
among other things  our software enables physicians  nurses and other clinicians to order tests  treatment and medications and record  access and share information about patients 
our software also facilitates patient admissions  scheduling  records maintenance  invoicing  inventory control  cost accounting  and assessment of the profitability of specific medical procedures and personnel 
our clinical content  which is integrated with our software  provides practice guidelines for use by physicians  nurses and other clinicians 
we also provide services related to our software 
these services include software and hardware maintenance  outsourcing  remote hosting of our software as well as third party healthcare information technology applications  network services  and training and consulting 
we believe that one of the key differentiators of our software is its open  flexible and modular architecture 
this allows our software to be installed one application at a time or all at once  and to integrate easily with software developed by other vendors or our client 
this enables our clients to install our software without the disruption and expense of replacing their existing software systems to gain additional functionality 
we market our software to small  stand alone hospitals  large multi entity healthcare systems  academic medical centers  community hospitals and other healthcare organizations 
we have one or more of our software applications installed in  or licensed to be installed at approximately  facilities 
most of the top ranked us hospitals named in us news world report s honor roll use one or more of our solutions 
in july  we acquired certain assets of sysware  a laboratory information system company 
during december  we closed a stock acquisition of mosum  sysware s related software development organization in india  once applicable indian regulatory approvals were received 
from july to such closing  we operated mosum under a management agreement 
since  eclipsys and sysware shared a strong strategic business relationship  with eclipsys marketing sysware s powerlab solution under the eclipsys sunrise laboratory brand 
this asset acquisition built upon that partnership and acknowledges the value of an integrated laboratory information system as a core module of eclipsys sunrise clinical manager suite of advanced clinical information solutions 
it also provided us with the foundation for our growing development and support organization in india 
in december  we acquired van slyck associates  inc  or vsa 
vsa is a patient classification  acuity driven nurse staffing service and software company 
since  eclipsys has offered sunrise patient acuity  a module that includes vsa s patient acuity methodology embedded into the interdisciplinary clinical documentation capabilities of eclipsys sunrise clinical manager 
sunrise patient acuity taps the vsa methodology  which enables calculation of patient acuity the patient s severity and complexity of illness or injury as an automatic byproduct of nursing documentation  and generates nurse staffing models based upon patient acuity to enable nurse managers to staff their units appropriately to ensure improved quality of care 
with this acquisition  eclipsys will be able to further expand its integrated solutions staffing and productivity management and reporting capabilities 
in january  we effected a restructuring of our operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately individuals  and the reorganization of our company 
this was undertaken to better align our organization  reduce costs  and re invest some of the cost savings into client related activities including client support and professional services 
in december we realigned certain management resources and consolidated some facilities to eliminate excess office space 
these activities resulted in restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  severance charges were million  of which million related to the termination of employment of certain management personnel 
of this charge  million was for non cash stock based compensation 
the excess office space consolidation resulted in charges of million related to the closing of three facilities 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies affect the reported amount of revenues and expenses and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and adjusts its estimates and judgments  if necessary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be materially different from those estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs  stock based compensation and our warranty reserve 
please refer to note of the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from licensing of computer software  software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting  outsourcing  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 
we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services  including implementation  integration  training and software maintenance  for periods of to years 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our software and services are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is considered probable  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software  whether we have the ability to make a reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our software and services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sop and sab  as amended  require among other matters  that there be a signed contract evidencing an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
many of our contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements which may provide for multiple software modules including the rights to unspecified future versions and releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or rights to unspecified software versions that support different hardware or operating platforms  and that do not qualify as exchange rights 
we refer to these arrangements as subscription contracts 
additionally  we sometimes enter into multiple element arrangements that do not include these rights to unspecified future software or platform protection rights 
we refer to these arrangements as traditional software contracts 
finally  we offer much of our software and services on a stand alone basis 
revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized as set forth below subscription contracts our subscription contracts typically include the following deliverables software license fees  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing upon the delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
the value of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant to statement of position or sop  modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions or sop these contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the suite purchased and or unspecified platform transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting 
accordingly  these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to paragraphs and of sop software revenue recognition or sop under certain arrangements  we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs and direct software implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
in the case of maintenance revenues  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value is based on substantive renewal prices  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
in the case of professional services revenues  vsoe is based on prices from stand alone sale transactions  and the revenues are recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph of sop third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery  pursuant to sab for remote hosting services  vsoe is based upon consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance requirements on a stand alone basis and substantive renewal terms  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed 
our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly the related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we consider the applicability of eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our remote hosting services arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if we determine that the client has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  a software element covered by sop exists 
when a software element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize the license  professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant to sop  whereby the fair value of the remote hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop is not present in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize revenue for the remote hosting services arrangement  ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract pursuant to sab traditional software contracts we enter into traditional multiple element arrangements that include the following elements software license  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
for those arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the software license revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
for arrangements where vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements software license revenue using the residual method in accordance with sop in addition to the software license fees  these contracts may also contain maintenance  professional services and hardware or remote hosting services 
vsoe and revenue recognition for these elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription contracts 
software contracts requiring contract accounting we enter into certain multiple element arrangements containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
under these arrangements  software license fees and professional service revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method over the implementation period which generally ranges from to months 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
stand alone software and service we also market certain software and services on a stand alone basis  including the following software license  maintenance  professional services  hardware  network services  outsourcing  and remote hosting services 
revenues related to such software and services are recognized as follows software license fees and maintenance are marketed on a stand alone basis may be licensed either under traditional contracts or under subscription arrangements 
software license fees under traditional contracts are recognized pursuant to sop upon delivery of the software  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
under subscription agreements for stand alone software  license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
with respect to maintenance  vsoe is determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
professional services represent incremental services marketed to clients including implementation and consulting services 
professional services revenues  where vsoe is based on prices from stand alone transactions  are recognized as services are performed 
hardware is recognized upon delivery pursuant to sab network service arrangements include the assessment  assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless carts or other wireless equipment to the client 
our network services arrangements are sold to a client for a fixed fee 
all services are performed prior to the delivery of the equipment 
these contracts are typically to days in length and are recognized pursuant to sab  upon the delivery of the network to the client 
remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to sab our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly  recognize the related set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
we provide outsourcing services to our clients 
under these arrangements we assume all responsibilities for a healthcare organization s it operations using our employees 
our outsourcing services include facilities management  network outsourcing and transition management 
these arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of systems and services in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
for   and reimbursable out of pocket expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees  we have classified the re imbursement by clients of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize a portion of our computer software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these costs include salaries  benefits  consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with programming and testing software 
capitalization ceases when the software is generally released for sale to clients 
management monitors the net realizable value of development costs to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future revenues 
capitalized software development costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these costs are amortized over the greater of the ratio that current revenues are to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable software or the straight line method over three years 
amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
warranty reserve the agreements that we use to license our software include a limited warranty providing that our software  in its unaltered form  will perform substantially in accordance with the related documentation 
through september   we did not incur any material warranty costs related to our software 
due to the response time issues that we identified in october  we recorded provisions related to warranty costs of million through december  this provision was reduced by  during the year ended december   as a result of a decrease in the estimation of expected warranty costs 
to date million has been expended against the provision 
warranty costs are charged to cost of systems and services when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
in determining this warranty reserve  we used significant judgments and estimates for the additional professional service hours and third party costs that will be necessary to remedy this issue on a client by client basis 
the timing and amount of our warranty reserve could have been different if we had used other judgments or assumptions in our evaluation 
at december   the remaining expected liability was million which is expected to be completed in stock based compensation see note for discussion of the company s restatements related to stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  as allowed by sfas  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december   nor in the year ended december  in december  fasb issued sfas r  which amended sfas sfas r required measurement of the cost of share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual period after june  effective january   we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas amortized over the awards vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  and risk free interest rate  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions were based on or determined from external data for example  the risk free interest rate and other assumptions were derived from our historical experience with share based payment arrangements for example  volatility and expected term 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
pro forma results for prior periods have not been restated 
implementation of sfas r resulted in an additional million in stock option expense during the year ended december  the adoption of sfas r had no impact on cash flows from operations or financing activities 
we have elected to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term as allowed by sab  share based payment 
we currently estimate volatility by using the weighted average historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using a weighted average historical forfeiture rate 
our estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
in connection with the company s restatement of its consolidated financial statements  the company has applied judgment in determining the correct measurement dates for prior option grants 
information regarding the restatement is set forth in the explanatory note regarding restatements immediately preceding part i  item and in note  review of stock option practices and restatements of consolidated financial statements in notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
results of operations revenues we derive revenues from licensing our software and the delivery of services including software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting services  outsourcing services  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 
our software and services are sold to clients under contracts that generally range in duration from to years 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  maintenance  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs include third party costs  software rental and maintenance and the amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology intangible assets 
capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related software  or are based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable software 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset 
cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions  and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs and events  public relations  trade shows  advertising  and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead  as well as consultants for the design  development and testing of new software 
we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of the cost of systems and services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which generally range from to years 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consist of the value of ongoing client relationships and acquired technology  have been amortized based upon their estimated economic lives at the time of the acquisition  and range from to years 
acquisition related goodwill is not amortizable since it has an indefinite life 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we conduct an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
as of december  and  there was no impairment of the goodwill balance 
taxes at december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
of this amount  million expires in and million expires in  the balance expires in varying amounts through of the total us net operating loss carryforward  million relate to stock option tax deductions which will be tax effected and the benefit credited as additional paid in capital when realized 
additionally  the company has canadian net operating loss carryovers of approximately million that expire in varying amounts through additionally  the company has an indian net operating loss of approximately million 
our indian subsidiary is entitled to a tax holiday which expires in we did not record a benefit for the resulting net deferred tax asset for any of the periods presented  because we believe it is more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
we are required to reverse the valuation allowance and record a benefit for the net deferred tax asset if and to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the asset 
this will result in a non recurring benefit in the period that we make the determination 
for all future periods  after the recognition of the non recurring benefit  we will record income tax expense in any period in which we earn taxable income 
in addition  we evaluated the impact of the restatements on our tax provision 
based on the analysis  the company did not record an incremental income tax provision for the periods impacted by the restatement as the company had previously provided a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset

in summary  research and development expense was as follows in thousands change change research and development expenses capitalized software development costs gross research and development expenses amortization of capitalized software development costs general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas r  higher employee related costs  higher professional service fees including legal and accounting  and higher costs associated with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system 
depreciation and amortization increased million or to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of higher depreciation associated with the activation of our enterprise resource planning solution during the second quarter of in january  we effected a restructuring of our operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately individuals  and the reorganization of our company 
this was undertaken to better align our organization  reduce costs  and re invest some of the cost savings into client related activities including client support and professional services 
in december  we realigned certain management resources and consolidated some facilities to eliminate excess office space 
these activities resulted in restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  severance charges were million  of which million related to the termination of employment of certain management personnel 
of this charge  million was for non cash stock based compensation 
the excess office space consolidation resulted in charges of million related to the closing of three facilities 
these restructuring activities will result in savings which are being reinvested in our business to help finance increases in our research and development capabilities and client services 
interest income interest income increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was due to an improvement in yields on marketable securities as well as higher marketable securities balances

these revenues increased million or to million in from million in additionally  professional services revenues which include implementation  integration  consulting and training services increased million or to million in from million in also  revenue related to software and networking services increased million or to million in compared to million in increases in ratably generated revenues were primarily driven by increases in outsourcing  remote hosting and subscription revenues which include software maintenance and software 
the increase in outsourcing revenues was primarily the result of revenues associated with a large contract entered into in q remote hosting revenues were favorably impacted by a shift in sales mix as more clients began to elect this option in lieu of purchasing hardware as a mechanism to deliver their software applications 
we expect that remote hosting will continue to expand as a delivery option in future periods 
subscription revenues increased as a result of progress made on a significant number of client implementations during the past twelve months as our clients continue to activate our clinical and financial modules 
these activations resulted in higher revenues under these contracts 
additionally  new sales bookings in and favorably impacted subscription related revenues 
revenues related to software and networking services increased million in compared to the prior year 
networking services increased million to million in compared to million in these increases were related to higher sales volume 
software related revenues increased million to million in this increase was primarily driven by an increase in third party related software revenues which increased from million in to million in other software related revenues  which includes revenues recognized upon delivery of our software and content sold directly by us or through third parties  increased from million in to million in these revenues can vary significantly from period to period and past levels are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
other software related revenues increased primarily as a result of a higher volume of revenues related to sales of our clinical practice content under a remarketing arrangement with a third party 
there is no assurance that we will generate comparable amounts under this arrangement in future periods 
the increase in third party software was a result of higher software sales in professional service revenues increased as a result of major activation activities at numerous client installations during additionally  we experienced significant growth in our consulting practice as clients have begun to acquire these services from us to improve their respective work flow and processes associated with their ongoing operations 
in  new sales levels associated with consulting and implementation services have significantly increased as clients have purchased higher volumes of these offerings to improve their workflows and benefits derived from using our software 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
hardware revenues decreased approximately million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease was a result of lower software related sales in and the first half of associated with the previously discussed software issue 
additionally  we have begun to experience a change in sales mix as more clients have elected remote hosting services in lieu of hardware purchases to operate their respective software applications 
we expect hardware and network service transactions will fluctuate in future periods due a variety of factors  including competition within the hardware industry  the status of the client implementations and future sales volumes related to hardware and network services 
revenue increases in any period are attributable  to a significant degree  to sales contracts entered into in prior years 
operating expenses cost of systems and services revenues increased approximately million or to million  for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in costs of systems and services revenues in was related to the following higher payroll related costs associated with an increase in outsourcing  higher costs associated with incremental remote hosting revenue  higher amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with the release of sunrise clinical manager xa in june and xa in march  higher costs associated with a higher volume networking services revenues  higher costs associated with an increase in third party related software revenues  and higher implementation costs associated with an expanded implementation team in connection with higher professional services volumes and an increased usage of third party consultants to augment these services 
during  we experienced a significant increase in costs associated with the use of third party consultants to augment our implementation services 
in q  we implemented an initiative to improve our professional services area which included a reorganization of these resources 
additionally  we are investing incremental resources in training related activities and improvements in our services infrastructure 
cost of hardware revenues decreased million to million or in compared to million in the decrease in these costs was directly related to the lower hardware volumes discussed above 
the gross margin percentage on hardware revenue decreased to in compared to in research and development expenses were million in compared to million in gross research and development spending  which consists of research and development expense plus capitalized software development costs  decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in overall spending was driven by an improvement in internal processes within the research and development organization and a shifting of resources from third party consultants to internal resources 
in summary  research and development was as follows in thousands change change research and development expenses capitalized software development costs gross research and development expenses amortization of capitalized software development costs the increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs was a result of the release of sunrise clinical manager xa in june and sunrise clinical manager xa in march these costs are included as a component of cost of systems and services revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily related to costs associated with the transition of our ceo resulting in incremental costs of million 
additionally  costs increased as a result of an incremental investment in our infrastructure related to the expansion of our management team and an increase in costs associated with incentive related compensation 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal costs and a reduction in insurance related expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased million or to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of an on going investment in our infrastructure in research and development area and other areas of the company 
the increase was also attributable to a full year of amortization for acquired intangible assets in the current year compared to a pro rated period in the prior year 
interest income interest income increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily related to better yields earned on cash and cash equivalent balances in as a result of these factors  our net income was million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during  operating activities provided million of cash

financing activities provided million from the proceeds of stock options exercised and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan 
stock option exercises were higher than usual during the year ended december  as a result of exercises of options from option holders whose employment was terminated in connection with our restructuring 
the timing and amount of cash provided by future stock option exercises is uncertain 
at december   the unpaid liability related to the restructuring of our operations effected in was million and will be paid out through see note to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   our principal source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million 
our future liquidity requirements will depend on a number of factors including  among other things  the timing and level of our new sales volumes  the cost of our development efforts  the success and market acceptance of our future product releases  and other related items 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  combined with our anticipated cash collections from customers is expected to be adequate to meet our currently anticipated liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
these amounts are expected to be funded from current cash and cash equivalent balances and future net income from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total the unconditional purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication services  computer equipment  maintenance  consulting and other commitments 
these amounts are expected to be funded from current cash and cash equivalent balances and the income generated from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
foreign currency fluctuations  through december   have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we generally invest in high quality debt instruments with relatively short maturities 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
nevertheless  investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the following table illustrates potential fluctuation in annualized interest income based upon hypothetical values for blended interest rates for marketable securities balances 
hypothetical marketable securities balances in thousands interest rate we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for our marketable securities portfolio as of december  would have resulted in a decrease in interest income of million for a twelve month period 
this sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions for example  it does not consider the impact of changes in the portfolio as a result of our business needs or as a response to changes in the market 
therefore  although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates  it is not intended to predict future results and our actual results will likely vary 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value
