item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  included in item  and with item a  risk factors 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed to own and operate the business conducted by our operating subsidiaries including the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas 
we own and operate pipeline systems in the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama  and florida and which extend northward through arkansas to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana  and ohio 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas when capacity is available 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid in advance of the service 
revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
for the year ended december   the percentage of our total operating revenues associated with firm contracts was approximately 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the price of natural gas can affect the overall supply and demand of natural gas  which in turn does affect our results of operations 
we deliver to a broad mix of customers including ldcs  municipalities  interstate and intrastate pipelines  direct industrial users  electric power generation plants  marketers and producers 
in addition to serving directly connected markets  our pipeline systems have indirect market access to the northeastern and southeastern united states through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties have had  and are likely to continue to have  a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity increasing competition for the transportation and storage of available gas supplies originating in a number of our supply areas  increasing competition from new and proposed pipelines providing natural gas to our market areas from other supply areas  the success of pipeline expansion in areas such as the barnett shale and fayetteville shale is dependent on natural gas prices being sufficiently high to support continued development in those areas  the likelihood that lng from the gulf coast region will become an increasingly important source of supply for our customers  a change in the price of natural gas at different locations basis differentials  which means that the value of the transportation services we offer may change over time based upon macro economic conditions 
we believe the collective impact of the trends and uncertainties described in the first two bullet points above may result in an increasingly competitive gas transportation market 
this could result in reduced rates on many of our contracts  adversely affecting revenue and cash flows 
we believe that the impact of the factors described in the third and fourth bullet points above may provide us with growth opportunities 
the last bullet point may result in reduced rates or provide growth opportunities based upon the level of basis differentials 
the last three bullets also result in the need for increasing amounts of capital expenditures to take advantage of opportunities to bring new supplies of natural gas into our systems to maintain or possibly increase our transportation volumes 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
earnings per unit we calculate net income per limited partner unit in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
 participating securities and the two class method under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
in issue of eitf no 
 the eitf reached a consensus that undistributed earnings for a period should be allocated to a participating security based on the contractual participation rights of the security to share in those earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed 
our general partner holds contractual participation rights which are incentive distribution rights in accordance with the partnership agreement as described in item of this report under incentive distribution rights 
the amount reported for net income per limited partner unit on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  was reduced to take into account an assumed allocation to the general partner s incentive distribution rights 
payments made on account of the incentive distribution rights are determined in relation to actual declared distributions and not based on the assumed allocation required by eitf no 
regulation certain revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds 
accordingly  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded considering regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
for instance  texas gas filed a general rate case with the ferc on april   and implemented new rates on november   subject to refund 
as of december   an estimated refund liability of approximately million related to the texas gas rate case was recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
the outcome of the rate case was determined in the second quarter  and the refund liability was reduced to zero by the amount of cash refunds paid to customers on june  the refund totaling approximately million consisted of million in principal and million in interest 
at december   there was no liability for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither texas gas nor gulf south are involved in an open general rate case 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires rate regulated public utilities to account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates 
in applying sfas no 
 texas gas records certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods 
gulf south does not apply sfas no 
 because certain services provided by gulf south are priced using market based rates and competition in gulf south s market area can result in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates such that the application of sfas no 
is not appropriate 
the storage facilities operated by our operating subsidiaries store gas that is owned by them as well as gas owned by customers 
consistent with the method of storage accounting elected by texas gas and the risk of loss provisions included in its tariff  texas gas reflects an equal and offsetting receivable and payable for certain customer owned gas in its facilities for certain storage and related services 
due to its method of accounting for storage  volumes held on behalf of others by gulf south are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
for further discussion of our gas in storage  please see note in item of this report 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and independent consultants and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the environmental protection agency epa  the ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas no 
requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
we used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  and that estimated fair value was compared to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount at december   and accordingly no impairment was recognized 
judgments and assumptions were used in management s estimate of discounted future cash flows used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the united states such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplemented our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve was developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s 
further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is included in note in item of this report 
financial analysis of operations we derive our revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for third parties 
transportation and storage services are provided under firm and interruptible service agreements 
item  nature of contracts  contains more information about the nature of our revenues 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at gulf south s compressor stations  which is part of operating expenses 
we charge shippers for fuel in accordance with each pipeline s individual tariff guidelines and gulf south s fuel recoveries are included as part of transportation revenues 
the following analysis discusses our financial results of operations for the years  and the acquisition of gulf south was consummated on december  three days of activity are included in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
the financial activity of gulf south for those three days is considered immaterial and does not impact discussions below 
compared with our net income for the year ended december  increased million or from the primary drivers for the increase were higher pal  gas storage and gas transportation revenues and a change in tax status concurrent with our ipo in november  as a result of which we ceased recording a charge in lieu of income taxes in our results of operations 
total operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in gas storage and pal revenues mainly due to favorable natural gas price spreads and volatility in forward natural gas prices  million increase in firm transportation revenues  excluding fuel  primarily due to higher reservation rates and additional capacity reserved by shippers due to increased production in the east texas region  and million increase due mainly to hurricane insurance recoveries received in and gas lost in related to hurricanes katrina and rita hurricanes 
the increases were partly offset by million decrease in interruptible transportation revenues due in part to customers shifting to firm services and supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes  million decrease in fuel retained due to lower realized natural gas prices and reduced throughput  and million decrease in revenues from the amortization of acquired executory contracts 
operating costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to million increase in outside services and overheads mainly due to growth in operations and regulatory compliance  million from the sale of storage gas related to phase i of our western kentucky storage expansion project that occurred in  million higher employee benefits costs comprised mainly of million from the amortization of a regulatory asset for postretirement benefits as a result of the texas gas rate case settlement and million from a special termination benefit charge recorded as a result of the early retirement incentive program  and million from an increase in depreciation and amortization due to an increase in our asset base and million increased expense from the lease of third party pipeline capacity 
the increases were partly offset by million decrease in hurricane related costs from million of hurricane related insurance recoveries recognized in and a reduction in hurricane related operating expenses from amounts incurred in  million decrease in company used gas due to operational efficiencies  lower natural gas prices and reduced throughput resulting in decreased usage 
total other deductions increased by million  or  of which million is primarily due to interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of new debt in november  offset by an increase in interest income 
compared with our net income for the year ended december   increased million or from the primary driver for the increase was the acquisition of gulf south on december  total operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in transportation revenues  substantially all of which was attributable to gulf south  and increased interruptible revenues due to supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes 
lower revenues from contract renewals and related discounting at the lebanon terminus of our texas gas system were partially offset by new rates  subject to refund  implemented by texas gas on november   and by new projects including transportation agreements related to our market area storage expansion project in western kentucky and increased capacity from carthage  texas by leasing capacity on a third party pipeline 
million increase in pal and gas storage revenues of which million was attributable to gulf south 
storage revenues at texas gas were lower by million primarily as a result of unusually high interruptible storage revenue generated in due to favorable market conditions  and million increase in other revenues of which million was attributable to gulf south 
operating costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is partially due to million increase attributable to gulf south  million of which was due to casualty losses recognized as a result of the hurricanes 
this increase was partly offset by million decrease due to the sale of storage gas related to phase i of our western kentucky storage expansion project  partially offset by asset retirements 
total other deductions increased by million  or  of which million is due to higher interest expense primarily related to debt incurred in to fund the acquisition of gulf south 
recent expansion projects we are currently engaged in several major pipeline and storage expansion projects that we expect will require the investment of approximately billion of capital from to before taking into account equity that would be contributed by the purchaser of a interest in gulf crossing pipeline 
the pipeline expansion projects will transport natural gas supplies from the bossier sands  barnett shale  fayetteville shale and the caney woodford shale areas in east texas  arkansas and oklahoma to our existing or new assets and third party interstate pipeline interconnects in alabama and mississippi 
for more information on our expansion projects  please see recent expansion projects in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our operating subsidiaries use funds from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under its revolving credit facility discussed below  to service its outstanding indebtedness and  when available  make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
our operating subsidiaries participate in a cash management program to the extent they are permitted under ferc regulations 
under the cash management program  depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements  boardwalk pipelines either provides cash to them or they provide cash to boardwalk pipelines  as discussed above 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  net of amounts received for salvage and accrued amounts  for  and were as follows in millions december  december  december  expansion capital maintenance capital total for the year ending december   we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately billion  of which we expect approximately billion to be for the expansion projects discussed in item and approximately million to be for maintenance capital 
the amount of expansion capital we expend in could vary significantly depending on the progress made with these projects  the number and types of other capital projects we decide to pursue  the timing of any of those projects and numerous other factors beyond our control 
we expect to fund our expansion capital expenditures for and beyond with proceeds from sales of our debt and equity securities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and operating cash flows  though we have not made any determination with regard to such financing 
we expect to fund our maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows 
equity and debt offerings during the fourth quarter  we completed an offering of  of our common units at a price of per unit 
the offering resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including million received from our general partner to maintain its interest in us 
also during the fourth quarter of  we completed an offering of million of senior notes due we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of million 
the proceeds of these offerings will be used to finance our expansion activities 
we used million of the proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility which were used to finance expansion activities 
to hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk free component of forward year interest rates through december   on october  we entered into a treasury rate lock for a notional amount of million of principal 
the reference rate on the treasury rate lock was 
the treasury rate lock was settled at the time of the closing of our debt offering in november we received million from the counterparty as a result of the settlement of the treasury rate lock  which has been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount of the credit in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in income as a reduction to interest expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the senior notes  resulting in an effective rate of  including the effects of the discounts and offering expenses 
in august  we entered into treasury rate locks with two counterparties each for a notional amount of million of principal to hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk free component of forward year interest rates through august  the reference rates on those treasury rate locks were and 
see item a for more information regarding the treasury rate locks and interest rate risk 
credit facility we maintain a million revolving credit facility under which boardwalk pipelines  texas gas and gulf south each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
under the terms of the agreement  each of the borrowers must maintain a minimum ratio  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the covenant requirements under our credit agreement and no funds were drawn under this facility 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june  contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations as of december   by period in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years lease commitments interest on long term debt capital commitments principal payments on long term debt total pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
the above table does not reflect commitments we have made after december  relating to our expansion projects 
for information on these projects please read capital expenditures above 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in net income before noncash adjustments for depreciation and amortization  provision for deferred income taxes and gain on disposal of operating assets  million increase in cash from a reduction in operating assets net of operating liabilities mainly from increases in payables and deferred income on pal agreements  and decreases in receivables  partly offset by an increase in other current assets primarily from the recognition of unrealized gains on derivatives  and million decrease in cash from a reduction in other noncurrent liabilities net of noncurrent assets 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in capital expenditures mainly related to our expansion projects  and million reduction in advances to affiliates 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities increased million to million provided by financing activities for the year ended december   compared to a use of million for the year ended december   primarily due to million decrease in cash used from the payment of notes and other long term debt in slightly offset by payment in of interim financing borrowed in for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of gulf south  and million decrease in cash provided from public offerings of common units 
impact of inflation we have experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  benefits  materials and supplies  and property  plant and equipment ppe 
a portion of the increased labor and materials and supplies costs have directly affected income through increased operating and maintenance costs 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our ppe and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices  we believe we may be allowed to recover and earn a return based on the increased actual costs incurred when existing facilities are replaced 
however  cost based regulation along with competition and other market factors limit our ability to price jurisdictional services or products to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements

forward looking statements investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this report as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of act 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements  and may contain the words expect  intend  plan  anticipate  estimate  believe  will likely result  and similar expressions 
in addition  any statement concerning future financial performance including future revenues  earnings or growth rates  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible actions by our partnership or its subsidiaries  which may be provided by management  are also forward looking statements as defined by the act 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  among others we may not complete projects  including growth or expansion projects  that we commence  or we may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than anticipated and we may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project  if completed 
the successful completion  timing  cost  scope and future financial performance of our expansion projects could differ materially from our expectations due to weather  untimely regulatory approvals or denied applications  land owner opposition  the lack of adequate materials  labor difficulties  difficulties we may encounter with partners or potential partners  expansion cost higher than anticipated and numerous other factors beyond our control 
the gas transmission and storage operations of our subsidiaries are subject to rate making policies and actions by the ferc or customers that could have an adverse impact on the rates we charge and our ability to recover our income tax allowance  our full cost of operating our pipelines and a reasonable return 
we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the environment and pipeline operations which may expose us to significant costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
any changes in such regulations or their application could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured 
the cost of insuring our assets may increase dramatically 
because of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells  our success depends on our ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond our control 
any decrease in supplies of natural gas in our supply areas could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
successful development of lng import terminals in the eastern or northeastern united states could reduce the demand for our services 
we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates 
significant changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand  reducing system throughput and adversely affecting our revenues 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
total long term debt at december   had a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
the weighted average interest rate of our long term debt was at december  in august  we entered into treasury rate locks with two counterparties each for a notional amount of million of principal to hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk free component of forward year interest rates through august  the reference rates on the rate locks are and 
under the terms of the rate locks  the counterparties would pay us settlement amounts if the year treasury rate is greater than the reference rates at october  conversely  we would pay the counterparties settlement amounts if the year treasury rate is less than the reference rates 
a basis point decrease in the year treasury rate would result in a million favorable change in the value of the rate locks 
conversely  a basis point increase in the year treasury rate would result in a million unfavorable change in the value of the rate locks 
the treasury rate locks were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
as of december   we reported a liability of million  and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income in an equal and offsetting amount less ineffectiveness recognized of less than million  for the fair values of the august rate locks 
certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million  of our gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  is exposed to commodity price risk 
additionally  as a result of the western kentucky storage expansion project  approximately bcf of gas stored underground with a book value of million is subject to forward sales agreements which base the ultimate sales price on the price of nymex natural gas futures  to be determined in march our operating subsidiaries utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas and also for cash received for fuel reimbursement 
the derivatives related to the sale of natural gas and cash for fuel reimbursement generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
and are designated as such 
the related unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of the derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the deferred gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged anticipated purchases or sales affect earnings 
the changes in fair values of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are expected to  and do  have a high correlation to changes in value of the anticipated transactions 
each reporting period we measure the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts 
to the extent the changes in the fair values of the hedge contracts do not effectively offset the changes in the estimated cash flows of the anticipated transactions  the ineffective portion of the hedge contracts is currently recognized in earnings 
if the anticipated transactions are deemed no longer probable to occur  hedge accounting would be terminated and changes in the fair values of the associated derivative financial instruments would be recognized currently in the consolidated statements of income 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
our exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and nns 
we maintain credit policies intended to minimize credit risk and actively monitor these policies 
natural gas price volatility has increased dramatically in recent years  which has materially increased credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu and  assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of gas loaned out at december  would have been approximately million 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   our cash equivalents were invested primarily in money market investments 
due to the short term nature and type of our investments  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our consolidated statements of income or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
