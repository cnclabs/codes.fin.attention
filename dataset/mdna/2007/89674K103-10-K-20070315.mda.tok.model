item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
our focus is on the specialized expertise  materials and know how of rf and other high and intermediate frequency applications 
we enjoy diversity in our markets  applications  products  technology and customer base 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates including compound semiconductor materials such as gaas and piezoelectric crystals such as litao we use a variety of process technologies using gaas substrates including hbt and phemt 
using various other substrates we also manufacture saw and baw products 
using these materials and our proprietary technology  we believe our products can overcome the performance barriers of competing devices in a variety of applications and offer other key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  higher power and power added efficiency  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at higher levels of performance than silicon devices 
we believe that these advantages our products offer can be a tremendous benefit to our customers  which include major communication companies worldwide 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions to applications in the wireless handset  broadband  base station and military markets 
our mission is  connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and military industries 
in the wireless handset market  we provide high performance devices such as rf filters  duplexers  receivers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and passive components 
we have also developed integrated rf modules with the goal of maximizing content and minimizing stacked margins  by offering complete module solutions with almost all subcomponents sourced from our own technologies and manufacturing facilities 
in broadband communications and wireless base station markets  we are a supplier of both active gaas and passive saw components 
we provide the military market with phased array radar antenna components and in were chosen to be the prime contractor on a darpa contract to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gan  a next generation gaas derived technology 
in  we obtained additional funding from the office of naval research to improve manufacturing methods of producing high power  high voltage s band gaas amplifiers 
the semiconductor industry in general was subject to slumping demand and excess capacity from through  however  demand began to grow in and remained strong through wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a very high level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create a material adverse impact on operating results 
in we began to increase the utilization at our facilities and were able to maintain higher utilization rates through however  we experienced higher than expected yield loss in  primarily due to the qualification of alternative supply sources and planned changes in our product flow to enable growth in future quarters  both of which had a negative impact on our gross margins for the year 
nevertheless  our results in represented a significant improvement as compared to and our fourth quarter results for represented the seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth 
we believe our growth in demonstrates our continued success towards our long term goals of innovation  profitable growth and share gains in our target markets 

table of contents the wireless handset market specifically had tremendous strength in  continuing a trend that began in we believe the drivers for continued growth in the handset market remain strong as users in developed countries are looking for new features such as digital cameras  video recorders  music players  gps  bluetooth  internet access  mobile television and other video standards  leading to high handset replacement rates 
this transition to more sophisticated handsets increases the rf content in each device  increasing our addressable market 
further  china  india and other emerging countries with improving economies are growing the consumer market by introducing a new customer base 
in the past however  during times of growing demand we have also experienced significant selling price pressure on some of our highest volume products 
the current demand need for increased rf content required for the higher data rates and increased functionality of new handset devices  has allowed average selling prices to stabilize 
however this stabilization may not continue 
in addition  the areas of growth from the emerging countries may be driven by less advanced handsets that do not require the performance and size advantages our products offer 
the continued deployment of cellular systems in asia and other emerging markets such as india have driven gsm base station transceiver volumes to new record levels 
however  softness in the cdma infrastructure market coupled with slower than expected demand in wcdma have resulted in a flat market for products targeting the traditional cellular base station market 
we expect continued benefit in sales of our point to point radio products  largely resulting from build outs in developing countries and those areas of the world where wireless backhaul systems are prevalent 
our broadband market includes products that support the transfer of data at high rates across wireless or wired networks 
our products for this market include those related to bluetooth  wireless lans  wifi  wimax  wibro  catv  microwave radio  cordless telephones  automotive and optical communications 
we also report our multi market standard products in the broadband category 
our strength in this market in was driven by our products for cordless phones  optical networks and other standard products 
we continue to work on developing lower cost products for our customers however  this may result in flat to lower revenues for an increased number of units 
revenues from the military market are generally for products in large scale programs with long lead times 
once a component has been designed into an end use product for a military application  the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the end use product and as a result  we tend to produce large volumes of these components 
currently  we are actively engaged with multiple military industry contractors in the development of next generation phased array systems and have key design wins in major projects such as the joint strike fighter and f initiatives 
in addition  in we entered into a multi year contract from the darpa to develop high power  wide band amplifiers in gan  and in july  we were awarded a million contract to improve manufacturing methods of producing high power  high voltage s band gaas amplifiers from the office of naval research 
we expect to participate in other large projects such as the b radar upgrade and hope to expand other programs in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  valuation of investments in privately held companies  which impacts net income when we record impairments  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  and stock based compensation which may impact inventory  cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  and reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
recognition of revenues we derive revenues primarily from the sale of standard and customer specific products and foundry services in the wireless handset  broadband  base station and military markets 
we also receive revenues from non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our markets during   and included wireless handsets  base stations  military  broadband and other standard products 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and two independent distributors 
sales of our products are generally made through either our sales force and independent manufacturers representatives or through our distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers  with shipments to our buy sell representatives and our distribution network accounting for less than of total revenues during  and revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products are recognized when title to the products pass to the buyer 
as more of our customers utilize inventory hubbing distribution facilities  our visibility on when the customer takes title to the products becomes more difficult for us to determine 
we receive periodic reports from these inventory hubs and recognize revenue when the customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  the point at which title to the goods pass to the customer 
although we have the right to audit the inventory held at these inventory hub locations  we cannot practically do so on a frequent basis and must rely on the reports we receive 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized in a manner so that the fees will reasonably reflect assured realization as the work is completed 
revenues from our distributors are recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
our distributor agreements provides for selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we occasionally offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve 
further  the distributors are obligated to pay the amount and the price or payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product  the distributors take title to the product and bear substantially all of the risks of ownership  the distributors have economic substance  we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
sales to our distributors were less than of our total revenues for  and we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons  and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and we reserve for such instances 
customers can only return products for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 

table of contents inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine the cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at a lower of cost or market valuation  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation  based on historical experience and our judgment of economic conditions  includes identifying those parts specifically identified as obsolete and reserving for them  analyzing forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserving for the excess  and identifying and recording other specific reserves 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  additional inventory reserves may be required and would have a negative impact on our gross margin in the period the adjustment is made 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying values when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying values 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying values exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the assets 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
technology markets are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid shifts in demand that are difficult to predict in terms of direction and severity 
if an asset is written down to fair value  that value becomes the asset s new carrying value and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies in previous years  we made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we held less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable 
in addition  as a result of the sale of our former optoelectronics operations  we received as partial consideration million of preferred stock in cyoptics  inc cyoptics and an unsecured promissory note from cyoptics for million  that was discounted million to reflect the current market rate for similar debt of comparable companies 
we account for all of these investments at cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
during our review  we evaluate the financial condition of the issuer  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the issuer that differ from expectation  could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
during  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net 
additionally during  we sold million of assets received from the liquidation of an investment we held in another privately held company including million of intellectual property received from the liquidation 
the intellectual property was held at a zero book value and we recorded a gain for the entire amount of proceeds received 
the remaining assets received from the liquidation of the investment resulted in a gain of less than million 
during  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company 
table of contents and our holdings in the investment were liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of this investment of million 
as of december  and  our total investment in privately held companies  including our note receivable from cyoptics  was million 
income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved in preparing our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges on foreign entities  merger  acquisition and disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by other factors 
changes could cause management to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed by management for their adequacy and appropriateness 
as of december   we were not currently under audit by the us income taxing authorities 
we concluded federal income tax audits for the us consolidated tax group on earlier years  most recently for the years and a to german tax audit of our subsidiary  triquint semiconductor gmbh  was completed during the third quarter of no significant adjustments were required as a result of the resolution of the audit 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the taxing authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
management believes that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
our provision for income taxes as of and for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands years ended december  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of revenues the provision for income taxes for and mainly consist of foreign tax liabilities in costa rica and germany of million and million  respectively 
no provision has been made for the u 
s  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are  intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
during  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets decreased by million  primarily due to the utilization of the net operating loss against us federal taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recognized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 

table of contents in  our optoelectronics operations were classified as discontinued operations 
during the year  we recorded income from the operations during the period in which we operated it  as well as a gain from the sale of the operations in the second quarter and the sale of the building in the third quarter 
we had net operating losses from prior periods which we applied to these gains to offset the tax impact from these gains 
however  sfas no 
requires the income tax effects related to these transactions be allocated among continuing and discontinued operations and as a result we recorded tax expense on our discontinued operations of million which was offset by a tax benefit recorded on our continuing operations for the same amount 
stock based compensation on january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  and included stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we accounted for compensation cost related to employee stock options and other forms of employee stock based compensation plans  other than our sawtek employee stock ownership plan  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 we applied financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allowed entities to continue to apply the provision of apb no 
and provide pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
these methods of accounting for stock based compensation involve a number of estimates about the expected lives of stock options  interest rates  stock volatility  and other assumptions as well as the selection of a valuation model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
a change in any of the assumptions used in the model  or the selection of a different option pricing model  could have a material impact on our operations

as a result  approximately  options with varying remaining vesting schedules were subject to the acceleration provision and became immediately exercisable 
in addition  on november   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of those employee stock options  excluding option grants to our company s board members and chief executive officer  with an option price equal to or greater than per share 
as a result of this acceleration  approximately  options with varying remaining vesting schedules were subject to the acceleration provision and became immediately exercisable  subject to our insider trading policy 
the accelerations were done as part of a comprehensive review of our entire benefits program 
the decision to accelerate some of our options was made after review of our current stock price  the competitive standpoint for our company from the options  the benefit of the options to the employees and the potential effects of sfas no

the total pro forma stock based employee compensation expense of million for included approximately million of expense resulting from the november  acceleration 
acquisitions and divestitures tfr technologies  inc on january   we successfully completed the acquisition of tfr  a manufacturer and developer of thin film resonator filters for communication applications using baw technology 
we believe that baw technology is critical to developing higher frequency filters for next generation wireless communication products and is a natural complement to our saw technology 
on the acquisition date  we paid million and paid an additional million in january we are also obligated to pay royalties on revenues we recognize from sales of tfr technology based products over the four year period subsequent to the acquisition date  up to a maximum of million 
as of december   we had recognized million of royalties on sales of tfr technology based products  which were recorded as additional goodwill 
in addition to these costs  we incurred total employee retention charges of million as a result of the acquisition  which we recognized during and in january  we distributed million of these benefits and in july  distributed the remaining million 

table of contents the tfr acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing cash due within one year royalties acquisition costs total the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows in millions cash accounts receivables and other assets inventory property  plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill payables and other liabilities total includes million of royalty charges incurred subsequent to the acquisition date 
agere s optoelectronics business on january   we completed an acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
the transaction included the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive optical components  optical amplifiers  optical transceivers and other optical products 
as part of the acquisition  we also assumed operation of the back end assembly and test operations associated with these products at a leased facility in matamoros  mexico 
we acquired this business to expand our market and product offerings in the optical networks market 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that the optoelectronics operations we purchased were not going to meet the revenue projections we made when we initially acquired the operations from agere 
significant reductions in average selling prices combined with reduced demand and valuation for new technologies in the optoelectronic market resulted in continued losses from these operations 
as a result  we announced the sale of these operations on april  and entered into an agreement to sell our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania and our optoelectronics subsidiary in matamoros  mexico to cyoptics 
with the sale  we believe we will benefit from focusing our attention on our growing wireless handset  base station  military and broadband markets and build upon our successful portfolio of gaas semiconductor and filter products 
the transaction allowed us to exit our optoelectronics operations that manufactured inp optical components  however  we will continue to manufacture and sell gaas based semiconductor products for optoelectronics equipment market produced and originally developed at our oregon and texas facilities 
revenues from gaas products for optical systems accounted for less than our revenues in and  respectively 
the sale  completed on april   was an asset sale including the products  manufacturing equipment  inventory  the mexican entity  related intellectual property rights and other assets that constitute the operations that manufacture inp optical chips and components for the optical networking market 
cyoptics paid us the following consideration million cash at closing  million of cyoptics preferred stock and a promissory note in the amount of approximately million  which was recorded net of a million discount to record the note at current market rates 
cyoptics also assumed certain liabilities associated with the optoelectronics operations  such as warranty obligations to customers 

table of contents separately  on march   triquint optoelectronics  a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the land and building and related facilities occupied by our optoelectronics operations in breinigsville  pennsylvania 
on july   we completed the sale to hamilton tek partners  lp hamilton for million  less commissions  fees  and other costs to sell the facility 
pursuant to the agreement  we assigned to hamilton our lease to cyoptics for approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility 
the lease was executed on april  and was for a period of two years 
our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the breinigsville  pennsylvania and matamoros  mexico optoelectronics operations as discontinued operations 
results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of operations addresses continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the table below sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
however  please note that these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

table of contents years ended december  and revenues from continuing operations our revenues from continuing operations increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenues in the wireless handset market  as our transmit module products gained traction with the handset manufacturers as their need for more advanced  integrated products expanded 
significant revenue growth was also seen in our broadband and other market  primarily from our lnas and other products 
we began to see an increase in overall demand for our products in the second quarter of and it continued throughout during each of the quarters of  our revenues increased with the fourth quarter of marking the seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth 
our overall book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was to with our handset market posting the strongest ratio of over to the overall book to bill ratio for the fourth quarter of represented a decrease from our ratio for the quarter ended december   however the december  ratio represented a substantial increase in booking dollars 
our revenues by end market for and are detailed below years ended december  revenues wireless handsets broadband base station military wireless handsets our revenues from products for the wireless handset market increased approximately in  compared to the growth was from increases in revenues from our products from all wireless air interface standards  which we believe is reflected in an increase in our market share 
our gsm gprs products had the largest revenue dollar increase in as compared to  increasing  while our wcdma products had the largest percentage increase in revenues as compared to revenues  increasing from less than million in to over million in our cdma products  which have historically been our largest revenue generator  also had strong gains during  as revenues increased over  as did our edge products which had a revenue increase of over in as compared to as a percentage of our overall handset revenue in  our cdma revenue continued to be our largest contributor accounting for of our revenue  as compared to in gsm gprs revenue accounted for of our revenue in  up from in our wcdma edge revenue increased to of our handset revenue in  up from in the largest revenue drivers across all our standards for the handset market were our transmit and power amplifier modules  which experienced revenue increases of approximately and  respectively  in as compared to revenues for these products increased as manufacturers are continuously looking for more integration in the products they purchase  and we believe our transmit and power amplifier modules address their needs nicely in a compact and cost effective manner 
overall  these two products accounted for nearly of our handset revenue in the total number of units shipped for our wireless handset products increased in as compared to although the products in our handset segment have lower average selling price  we have been increasing our average selling price by approximately in as compared to in  the increases in volume and average selling prices resulted in higher gross margins  which we hope continue to increase 

table of contents broadband revenues from the broadband market and other products included in this segment  which include wlan  satellite  cable and other standard products  increased in as compared to the tremendous growth in this market was primarily due to strength from our dual low noise amplifier wlan products  combined with our optical devices  cordless phone  gps  broadband wireless application and other standard products 
as a percentage of our total revenues  our broadband and other products accounted for in  as compared to in base station revenues from the base station products  including point to point radios  increased approximately in as compared to the increase was primarily driven primarily by an increase in revenues from our lna products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our base station if filters 
our revenues from point to point radio products remained strong and accounted for approximately of our revenues in  down slightly from in our revenues from gsm gprs edge base station products remained stable in as compared to  and accounted for approximately of our base station revenues in both periods 
however  our cdma and wideband cdma base station product revenues declined approximately in as compared to and accounted for less than of the base station revenues in the decline for cdma products was first evident in from build out softness as evdo build outs in korea  japan and the us were largely completed 
the decline was further affected by the delay of g licensing in china which postponed both cdma and wcdma build outs in that region 
military revenues from our military related products increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from our radar related products  such as our power amplifiers and other products  which increased in as compared to in late  we began to experience increased quoting activity and stronger demand for our passive products than we had seen in recent quarters 
as a percentage of our total revenues  military related products decreased to in  down from in however  the absolute dollar value of our total revenues increased in this segment and we believe our darpa and office of naval research contracts will help drive our investment in research and development for fundamental technology leadership in this segment and beyond 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in  compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in our revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from asia  india and other developing countries where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us revenues from both china and singapore were the only foreign countries which represented greater than or more of total revenues in  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in  china was the only foreign country which represented or more of revenues with approximately million and in  china and korea were the only foreign countries which represented or more of revenues with approximately million and million  respectively 
revenues generated from our us operations were million in and million in  respectively 
revenues generated from our international operations were million in and million in  respectively 
transfers between these operations were million in and million in  respectively 
our us operations accounted for million of our long lived assets in and million in our international operations accounted for million of our long lived assets in and million in 
table of contents gross profit gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor  stock based compensation  and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to non recurring engineering revenues 
in general  we derive a higher gross profit margin on lower volume products for the base station  broadband and military markets  such as point to point radios and satellite systems  whereas products for wireless handsets are higher volume  more price sensitive and generally lower margin products 
in  our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was including million of equity compensation charges resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  excluding the impact of the equity compensation charges  our gross margin for improved to  as compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of improved capacity utilization and shorter lead times  which produced a higher absorption of fixed overhead costs 
the gross margin in was negatively impacted by planned changes in our product flow to enable future demand  qualification of alternative suppliers  the production of new products and other factors 
these factors negatively affected our manufacturing yields in  resulting in reduced margins 
however  we are taking the corrective action required to improve our yields and expect improved results in research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million to million  as compared to million in the expenses include stock based compensation costs of million resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
excluding the increase in expenses due to the adoption of the new accounting standard  our research  development and engineering increased million in as compared to  primarily due to increases in research and development material and supplies  outside services and compensation expense 
as a percentage of revenues our research  development and engineering expenses in excluding equity compensation charges were  compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million  as compared to million in our expense in included million of stock based compensation costs resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
excluding the increase from the adoption of sfas no 
r  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of our increased revenues  as well as increased marketing expenses  labor costs  depreciation  travel expenses  legal fees and insurance costs 
however  as a percentage of revenues our selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of revenues  including equity compensation costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  net of stock based compensation  as a percentage of revenues were in  as compared to in our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased from those that we reported in our february  earnings release due to an accrual related to outstanding litigation 
reduction in workforce in  we recorded a charge of million associated with a reduction in force of approximately employees assigned to our operations in apopka  florida and san jose  costa rica 
the charge was a result of our ongoing efforts to align costs and capacity with the reduced levels of production and revenues at these facilities 
we had no similar charges in 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in  we recorded impairments on long lived assets of less than million associated with the write down of certain fabrication equipment held for sale to its fair market value

recovery of impairment impairment charge investment in other companies in  we reduced the value of three investments by a total of million  net 
the reductions in value were determined from analysis of the financial condition of the companies  which had deteriorated  or the reduction in our percentage ownership of the privately held companies in which we had invested

income loss from discontinued operations we recorded a net gain from discontinued operations of million in  which included a gain of million from the disposal of the operations in the second quarter of and the sale of the facility in the third quarter of  combined with gains on the sale of excess assets of the optoelectronics business of million 
these gains were partially offset by losses from the optoelectronic operations of approximately million and the tax expense from the discontinued operations of million 
the results of the discontinued operations in reflected only four months of full operations as we completed the sale on april  there were no such events in years ended december  and revenues from continuing operations our revenues from continuing operations decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to significantly lower revenues in the wireless handset segment  as handset manufacturers continued to migrate towards direct conversion architecture and sales of our if filter products declined 
declines were also seen in our broadband and military markets

our cdma and wideband cdma base station product revenues declined approximately in as compared to and accounted for approximately of the base station revenues in the decline for cdma was due to cdma build out softness as evolution data optimized evdo build outs in korea  japan and the us were largely completed combined with a the delay of g licensing in china which postponed both cdma and wcdma build outs in that region 
military revenues from our military related products decreased approximately in as compared to the decline was primarily due to decreases in revenues from if filters  hpas high power amplifiers and other products 
these decreases were mostly offset by increases in revenues from research and development and rf filters 
the increase in research and development revenues was primarily due to the execution of a darpa contract in the first quarter of for the development of a gan process and products  in which we are the prime contractor

recent transactions affecting liquidity on march   our convertible subordinated notes became due 
on this date we retired the million outstanding notes and accrued interest payable using our cash reserves 
prior to the march  maturity of the notes  we had repurchased million face value of the original million since their issuance 
during the fourth quarter of we announced our plan to repurchase up to million of our common stock under a rule b plan  with the timing of the purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased dependant upon market conditions

during this time  we repurchased and retired  shares at an average cost of 
sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  together with cash generated from continuing operations are currently our principal sources of liquidity and we believe these will satisfy our projected working capital  capital expenditure  and possible investment needs  through the next months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are capital expenditures or investment needs in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity offerings  debt financings or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
our subordinated notes became due on march  and at that time we retired the million of notes with our cash reserves 
we believe that subsequent to this payment we continue to have sufficient funds to operate effectively  however we may obtain additional financing to meet certain liquidity needs 
we expect our need for capital expenditures in to be similar to our expenditures

recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  in september sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
our adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
also in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
fsp aug air prohibits companies from recognizing planned major maintenance costs under the accrue in advance method that previously allowed for the accrual of a liability over several reporting periods prior to the performance of the maintenance 
fsp aug air is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fsp aug air effective january   which is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents the staff of the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in september sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements at december  in july  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus and ratified issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences 
statement no 
provides guidance for accounting for compensated absences and states that an employer shall accrue a liability for employees compensation for future absences if certain conditions are met 
however  since certain compensated absences such as sabbatical leave do not typically accrue until fully vested  there was uncertainty as to whether employee rights to the compensated absence accumulate and meet the conditions of statement no 
the consensus reached by the eitf has determined that sabbatical and other similar benefits do accumulate and should be accrued for over the requisite service period 
further  the eitf has called for adoption of the consensus for fiscal years beginning after december  we have historically accrued for sabbatical leave only when the employee fully vests upon completion of the requisite five year service period  which is in accordance with our company policy 
eitf was effective beginning january  and we will record a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately million to retained earnings in the first quarter of also in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for income tax uncertainties 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued guidance also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
fin was effective beginning january  and the cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded in the first quarter of we believe that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we typically hold various securities and debt instruments that are subject to the effects of inflation 
in addition  our products require raw material such as gold and other materials that may also be impacted by inflation 
we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and expenses in the past  however significant fluctuations in the future could have a negative impact on our operating results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents  short term and long term investments our investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and long term investments  such as us government agencies  corporate debt securities  commercial paper and other such low risk investments  
table of contents in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur which we cannot control 
although the risks are minimal  fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted because of changes in interest rates and credit ratings 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer principal losses if we were to sell securities that have declined in value because of changes in interest rates or issuer credit ratings 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
further  we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially impacted by an immediate change in interest rates 
debt as of december   we had million principal of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  due on march  these notes were paid off in full on march  with our cash holdings 
the notes had a fixed interest rate and consequently we did not have significant interest rate cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes was subject to fluctuations due to their convertibility into shares of our stock and other market conditions as well as their sensitivity to fluctuations in the general level of the us interest rates 
we may also be exposed to similar interest rate risk in the future if we use additional financing to fund capital expenditures or strategic investments 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments and convertible subordinated notes as of december  in thousands cost fair value cash and cash equivalents including unrealized losses of available for sale investments including unrealized losses of convertible subordinated notes foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica and germany 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments and to hedge material cash flows that are not denominated in us dollars  in accordance with a foreign exchange risk management policy approved by our board of directors 
we primarily use currency forward contracts for this purpose 
this hedging activity will reduce  but may not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of forward currency exchange contracts outstanding were approximately million and million  respectively  both of which were designated as cash flow hedges 
we had no contracts designated as fair value hedges at december  or
