business overview we are incorporated in delaware 
a pioneer in the computer networking industry  we provide secure  converged networking solutions  as well as maintenance and support services  for enterprises and public sector organizations of all sizes 
headquartered in marlborough  massachusetts  we have worldwide operations  including sales  marketing  research and development  and customer service and support capabilities 
our products and services can generally be classified in the following categories networking  security  voice  services  and legacy connectivity products 
we have undergone significant changes in recent years  including forming the huawei com joint venture or hc  acquisition of majority ownership of hc and subsequently purchasing huawei s remaining percent ownership interest in hc  financing a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of huawei s percent ownership in hc by entering into a million senior secured credit agreement  restructuring activities which included outsourcing of information technology  all manufacturing activity in our scn segment  and significant headcount reductions in other functions  and selling excess facilities  significant changes to our executive leadership  acquiring tippingpoint technologies  inc  and realigning our scn sales and marketing channels and expenditures 

table of contents we believe an overview of these significant recent events is helpful to gain a clearer understanding of our operating results 
significant events hc on november   we formed our joint venture  huawei com co  limited now known as hc technologies co  limited which is domiciled in hong kong and has its principal operating center in hangzhou  china 
we contributed million in cash  assets related to our operations in china and japan  and licenses to intellectual property related to those operations in exchange for a percent ownership interest of the joint venture 
during fiscal  we exercised our right to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest in hc and entered into an agreement with huawei  our joint venture partner  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
we were granted regulatory approval by the prc  and subsequently completed this transaction on january  date of acquisition 
consequently  we owned a majority interest in the joint venture and determined that the criteria of emerging issues task force no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights was met 
accordingly  we consolidated hc s financial statements from the date of the acquisition of the additional two percent ownership interest 
under the hc shareholders agreement  both partners had the right to initiate a bid process to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest at any time after the third anniversary of hc s formation 
we initiated the bidding process on november  to buy huawei technologies percent stake in hc  and our bid of million was accepted by huawei on november  the transaction closed on march  we financed a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of huawei s percent ownership in hc through a million senior secured credit agreement with several lenders 
details of the borrowing are more fully discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
new products we have introduced multiple new products targeted at the small  medium and large enterprise markets  including modular switches and routers  as well as voice over ip  or voip  security  wireless and unified switching solutions 
we also announced our open services networking  or osn  strategy 
business environment and future trends networking industry analysts and participants differ widely in their assessments concerning the prospects for near term industry growth 
industry factors and trends also present significant challenges in the medium term with respect to our goals for sales growth  gross margin improvement and profitability 
such factors and trends include intense competition in the market for higher end  enterprise core routing and switching products  aggressive product pricing by competitors targeted at gaining share in market segments where we have had a strong position historically  such as the small to medium sized enterprise market  and the advanced nature and ready availability of merchant silicon  which allows low end competitors to deliver competitive products and makes it increasingly difficult for us to differentiate our products 

table of contents we believe that long term success in this environment requires us to be a global technology leader 
now that we have closed our hc transaction  we intend to leverage our global footprint to more effectively sell our products into expanding markets and to utilize cost effective technology development strategies 
we also believe that our long term success is dependent on investing in the development of key technologies 
accordingly  our key focus of fiscal will continue to be to manage our hc operating segment for expected continued long term growth  to make targeted investments in the integration of sales efforts and back office functions between hc and scn  as well as to manage our scn operating segment towards our goal of a return to profitability while maintaining investment levels in key technologies 
in fiscal  we also intend to continue investing in the hc segment 
this is expected to involve continued investment in research and development  increased focus on growth both inside and outside of china  growing the dedicated hc infrastructure in concert with a global com consolidated plan  and managing certain key aspects of employee retention as discussed below 
in addition we may make certain targeted investments in the integration of the hc and scn operating segments designed to drive more profitable near and long term growth of the business 
we continue to face significant challenges in the scn segment with respect to sales growth  gross margin and profitability 
we believe future sales growth for the scn segment depends to a substantial degree on increased sales of our networking products  and we believe our best growth opportunity requires us to expand our product lines targeting small and medium businesses  or smb  customers as well as selected medium enterprise customers 
these product enhancements are expected to be based in part upon leveraging open source and open architecture platforms to differentiate our networking offerings 
these are also expected to be complemented by expanded security offerings such as the development of attack  access and application controls 
finally  we intend to look to improve our channels to market on these products  especially through relationships with system integrators and service providers 
in order to achieve our sales goals in the scn segment for fiscal  it is important that we continue to enhance the features and capabilities of our products in a timely manner in order to expand our addressable market opportunities  distribution channels and market competitiveness 
also  we expect a very competitive pricing environment for the foreseeable future  this will likely continue to exert downward pressure on our scn sales  gross margin and profitability 
another key priority will be the integration of hc 
our integration focus will initially include launching the second phase of our integration of our asia pacific region sales models for data networking sales  especially in the medium enterprise market  and integrating certain information technology it  supply chain and customer support functions to enable seamless go to market models and achieve synergies between our operating segments 
other important factors in the continued success of our hc business are expected to include retaining key management and employees  continuing sales through huawei as an oem partner of hc in the near to medium term  and continuing the year over year growth in hc 
hc s china sales growth has been historically strong  however we expect this growth to be closer to market rates in fiscal we intend to retain employees through a long term retention and incentive structure at hc 
we also currently have the intention to execute an initial public offering ipo of common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary tippingpoint  our business that develops  markets and sells security products and services  such as its intrusion prevention system appliances and its security protection updates through its digital vaccine service 
any sale of tippingpoint stock would be registered under the securities act of  and such shares of common stock would only be offered and sold by means of a prospectus 
this annual report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities of tippingpoint  and there will not be any sale of any such securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation  or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state 
we currently expect to file a registration statement related to the ipo by the end of the calendar year 
we currently intend to remain a majority tippingpoint shareholder following the ipo and plan to reduce our ownership over time in subsequent transactions 

table of contents basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to may fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on june  fiscal year  consisted of weeks ended on june   and fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on june  for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
during fiscal we exercised our right to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest in hc and entered into an agreement with huawei for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we were granted regulatory approval by the chinese government and subsequently completed this transaction on january  date of acquisition 
since that time  we have owned a majority interest in the joint venture and have determined that the criteria of emerging issues task force no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights have been met 
accordingly  we consolidated hc s financial statements from the date of acquisition  and  until we became a percent owner of hc as described below  recorded huawei s proportionate share of the income of hc as a minority interest in the income of consolidated joint venture 
both joint venture partners had the right to initiate a bid process to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest at any time after the third anniversary of hc s formation 
on november   com initiated a bid process under the shareholders agreement by submitting a bid to buy huawei s entire ownership interest in hc 
on november   huawei accepted com s last bid to buy huawei s remaining percent share for million 
the transaction was approved by the prc government and on march   com technologies completed its purchase at which time the purchase price was paid in full 
huawei com co  limited is now known as hc technologies co  limited  or hc 
on march   hc holdings limited the borrower  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of com corporation  entered into a credit and guaranty agreement dated as of march  among the borrower  com corporation  com holdings limited and com technologies  as holdco guarantors  various lenders  goldman sachs credit partners lp  as mandated lead arranger  bookrunner  administrative agent and syndication agent gscp  and industrial and commercial bank of china asia limited  as collateral agent the existing credit agreement 
under the existing credit agreement  on march  the borrower borrowed million the existing loan to finance a portion of the purchase price for the march  acquisition the acquisition of huawei s percent stake in hc 
on may   the parties amended and restated the existing credit agreement in order to  among other things  convert the existing loan into two tranches with different principal amortization schedules and different interest rates the a r loans 
the other provisions of the existing credit agreement  including covenants  collateral  temporary guarantees and other provisions  remain largely unchanged 
the closing of the a r loans occurred on may  following the hc percent acquisition we determined that our chief decision making officer receives reports  manages  and operates our business as two separate units  the scn business and the hc business 
as a result we currently report two operating segments  scn and hc 
see footnote note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
prior to the additional percent acquisition we accounted for our investment in hc by the equity method 
under this method  we recorded our proportionate share of hc s net income or loss based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements of hc under the caption equity interest in income loss of unconsolidated joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
our acquisition of tippingpoint on january   was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the assets purchased and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the operating results of tippingpoint are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  fiscal contains a full year of tippingpoint s results compared to five months of results in fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which appear in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and services 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
in the hc segment  certain customers pay accounts receivable with bills receivable from chinese banks with maturities less than six months 
these are also referred to as bankers acceptances 
a significant portion of our sales is made to distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and excess channel inventory levels 
we maintain reserves for potential allowances and adjustments  if the actual level of returns and adjustments differ from the assumptions we use to develop those reserves  additional allowances and charges might be required 
for sales of products that contain software that is marketed separately  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sales of services  including professional services  system integration  project management  and training  are recognized upon delivery of performance 
other service revenue  such as that related to maintenance and support contracts  is recognized ratably over the contract term  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
royalty revenue is generally recognized when we receive payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor payments from our customers on an on going basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
we perform detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis  for both inventory on hand and inventory that we are committed to purchase  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to cost of sales might be required  alternatively  we might realize benefits through cost of sales for sale or disposition of inventory that had been previously written off 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting literature 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we review the value of our intangible assets in accordance with the applicable accounting literature for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
as of may   we had million of goodwill and million of net intangible assets remaining on our balance sheet  which we currently believe to be realizable based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we estimate fair value of goodwill using third party valuation reports and the fair value of our intangible assets using estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the carrying value of these assets  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be re evaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
equity securities and other investments we account for non marketable equity securities and other investments at historical cost or  if we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee  by the equity method 
investments accounted for by the equity method include investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and  prior to the acquisition of majority ownership on january   the investment in hc 
in accounting for these investments by the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the fund s net income or loss  or hc s net income or loss  based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements 
since hc has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we reported our equity in hc s net income or loss based on hc s most recent quarterly financial statements  two months in arrears 
for the year ended may  we accounted for hc under the equity method for ten months of the year 
we review all of our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in the event that the investment impairment is other than temporary  we would write the investment down to its impaired value 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  which requires all stock based compensation to employees as defined in sfas no 
r  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
estimates of the fair value of equity awards in future periods will be affected by the market price of our common stock  as well as the actual results of certain assumptions used to value the equity awards 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected volatility of the common stock  the expected term of options granted  and the risk free interest rate 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model and applying the single option approach to the stock option valuation 
the options generally have vesting on an annual basis over a vesting period of four years 
we estimate the expected option term by analyzing the historical term period from grant to exercise and also considers the expected term for those options that are outstanding 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period 
for equity awards granted after june   the volatility of the common stock is estimated using the historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is determined by looking at historical us treasury zero coupon bond issues with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the equity awards 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model  because we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
lastly  in accordance with sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in order to determine an estimated pre vesting option forfeiture rate  we used historical forfeiture data  which yields a forfeiture rate of percent 
we believe this historical forfeiture rate to be reflective of our anticipated rate on a go forward basis 
this estimated forfeiture rate has been applied to all unvested options and restricted stock outstanding as of june  and to all options and restricted stock granted since june  therefore  stock based compensation expense is recorded only for those options and restricted stock that are expected to vest 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives have required us to record restructuring charges related to severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  accelerated depreciation and write downs of held for sale properties  write downs of other long term assets  and other restructuring costs 

table of contents given the significance of our restructuring activities and the time required for execution and completion of such activities  the process of estimating restructuring charges is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record charges when we have taken actions or have the appropriate approval for taking action  and when a liability is incurred 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as we continue to evaluate the business  we might be required to record additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
product warranty a limited warranty is provided on most of our products for periods ranging from days to limited lifetime  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales might be required 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in a number of jurisdictions 
a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes  and it is reasonably possible that such assets may not be recovered and that such liabilities may not be paid or that payments in excess of amounts initially estimated and accrued may be required 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our recent losses  retained deficit  operating performance in fiscal  and estimates of future profitability  we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our us net deferred tax assets as of may  accordingly  we have established an appropriate valuation allowance to offset such deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in jurisdictions in which we do or have done business 
many of these contingencies arise from periods when we were a substantially larger company 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the expected potential loss from such contingency  and are monitored by management 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded or that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
we have us federal loss carryforwards of approximately billion as of may  expiring between fiscal years and  substantially all of which expire between fiscal years and 
table of contents results of operations years ended may    and as a result of the acquisition of hc  we currently report two operating segments  scn and hc  for the years ended may  and for the year ended may  we managed and reported our operations as a single  integrated business 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
sales cost of sales gross profit margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization and write down of intangible assets in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss gain on investments  net interest income  net other income expense  net loss from operations before income taxes  equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture and minority interest in income of consolidated joint venture income tax provision benefit equity interest in income loss of unconsolidated joint venture minority interest in income of consolidated joint venture net loss comparison of fiscal and during the year ended june  we continued to experience strong results in our hc segment offset by declines in our scn segment s sales and we continued to reduce operating expenses in our scn business segment  offset in part by continued investment in the tippingpoint security business 
sales the increase in sales from the fiscal year to the fiscal year was primarily due to the inclusion of full year hc sales in the current period  as well as increased sales of tippingpoint security products 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in networking revenues in our scn segment 

table of contents the following table shows our sales from products categories in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year networking security voice services connectivity products total networking revenue includes sales of our layer and layer stackable managed switching lines  our modular switching lines  routers  wireless switching offerings and our small to medium sized enterprise market products 
sales of our networking products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of full year results from our hc segment offset in part by decreases in scn sales 
security revenue includes our tippingpoint products and services  as well as other security products  such as virtual private network  or vpn  and network access control  or nac  offerings 
sales of our security products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to organic growth in sales of security products in fiscal and the inclusion of hc s full year results of security product sales 
voice revenue includes our vcx and nbx voice over internet protocol  or voip  product lines  as well as voice gateway offerings 
sales of our voip telephony products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of full year results from our hc segment 
services revenue includes professional services and maintenance contracts  excluding tippingpoint maintenance which is included in security revenue 
service revenue in fiscal increased percent from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of full year results from our hc segment 
connectivity products revenue includes our legacy network interface card  personal computer card  and mini peripheral component interconnect offerings 
at the end of fiscal sales of these products are close to zero with continued revenue only expected to be from royalty arrangements 
sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year north america latin and south america europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific china total sales information by geography to the extent available is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point  except in the case of hc s oem sales which are based on the hub locations of hc s oem partners 
china sales increased percent primarily due to the inclusion of hc results for the full year in fiscal 
table of contents gross profit margin gross profit margin improved percent to percent in the twelve months ended june  from percent in the same period in the previous fiscal year 
significant components of the improvement in gross profit margins were as follows twelve months ended june  consolidation of hc scn cost improvements scn product mix and selling price reductions scn volume impact total the increase is due to the consolidation of hc results in the current period 
the hc segment generally has higher gross margins 
the increase in the scn margin was primarily the result of lower product material and delivery costs 
the decrease in the scn margin was the result of lower average selling prices and an unfavorable shift in product mix 
the decrease in the scn margin was the result of lower revenue on the portion of our costs that are fixed in nature 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
included in the increase in operating expenses were hc operating expenses of million for the full year ended may  as compared to million for the two months consolidated in in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in the year ended may   which were not incurred in the previous fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by significant cost reduction in our scn segment as compared to the previous year 
the full year inclusion of hc was the primary contributor to increases in sales and marketing expenses of million  research and development expenses of million  general and administrative expenses of million  and amortization of intangibles of million 
purchase accounting charges related to the acquisition of the remaining percent interest of hc was the main contributor to the increase in in process research and development of million 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease of restructuring charges of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the increase of was the inclusion of million of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  partially offset by significant cost reductions in our scn segment 
a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in our hc segment in the year ended may  the expenses were not incurred in the previous fiscal year and were partially offset by a reduction in the scn sales and marketing expenses 
the reduction of the scn sales and marketing expenses were primarily related to the reduction of programmatic marketing expenses  and a reduction in employee related expenses due to our restructuring efforts 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in our hc segment in the year ended may  these expenses were not incurred in the previous fiscal year and were partially offset by the reduction in scn research and development expenses 
the decrease in the scn research and development costs was related to reduced non recurring engineering projects and employee related expenses in the non tippingpoint related portion of our scn segment which was slightly offset by increased investment in tippingpoint research and development 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  in addition  the incurrence of the change in control portion of hc s earp bonus program contributed compensation expenses of million in our hc segment in the year ended may  these expenses were not incurred in the previous fiscal year and were partially offset by a reduction in the scn general and administrative expenses 
the reduction of the scn general and administrative expenses were primarily related to the reduced workforce related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and reduced it and facilities related expenses 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles increased due primarily to the inclusion of hc expenses for the entire fiscal year ended may  the amortization expense related to the march  purchase of percent of hc in is through march  as we record hc results on a two month lag 
in process research and development 
million of the total purchase price of percent of the remaining minority interest in hc has been preliminarily allocated to in process research and development and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
at the time of acquisition  hc had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including employee severance and outplacement costs of million  and facilities related credits of million 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
further actions may be taken if our business activity declines or additional cost reduction efforts are necessary 
gain on investments  net during fiscal  net gains on investments were million  primarily reflecting gains from sales of certain equity securities

minority interest of huawei in the income of consolidated huawei com joint venture in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the acquisition of the percent interest in hc held by huawei prior to our purchase 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing huawei s percent interest in the net income reported by the former hc joint venture for the two month period included in our fiscal comparison of fiscal and sales the increase in sales from the fiscal year to the fiscal year was primarily due to the inclusion of two months of hc sales in the fiscal  as well as increased sales of tippingpoint security products and the inclusion of tippingpoint s results for the full year 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in networking revenues in our scn segment 
the following table shows our sales from products categories in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year networking security voice services connectivity products total sales of networking products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal networking revenue includes sales of the hc sourced enterprise products  our layer and layer stackable managed switching lines  wireless and officeconnect hardware  baseline branded small to medium sized enterprise market products  and hc s router and switching products 
the increase in sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of two months results from the hc joint venture 
we also saw growth from the introduction of the line of layer switches sourced from hc as well as growth in our modular core and router products 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in demand for layer switches and a reduction in average selling prices resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by a shift in mix towards lower priced products 
sales of security products in fiscal increased percent from fiscal security revenue includes our tippingpoint products and services  as well as other security products  such as our embedded firewall product 
the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of tippingpoint s sales for the full period and  to a lesser extent  organic growth in sales of security products in fiscal and the inclusion of hc s security product sales 
sales of our embedded firewall products increased in the year ended may  voip telephony revenue includes our vcx and nbx voip product lines

asia pacific sales increased percent primarily due to the inclusion of hc results for two months in fiscal gross profit margin gross profit margin as a percentage of sales improved percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the improvement in gross profit margin were as follows increased sales of security products and inclusion of tippingpoint higher margin products for full current period consolidation of hc higher margin products scn product mix and selling price reductions royalty payment reductions other total the increase was the result of higher average selling prices and margin for tippingpoint s security products compared to other scn products as well as the inclusion of a full year of tippingpoint results in fiscal year the increase is due to the inclusion of two months of results of hc which generally have higher gross margins 
the decrease in the scn margin was the result of lower average selling prices and an unfavorable shift in product mix 
these declines were partially offset by product cost reductions 
fiscal year included final disbursements on two significant royalty payments 
other cost reduction activities included freight consolidation  and a reduction in the connectivity products business that consequently caused a decrease in unit shipment per revenue dollar which lowered variable costs

table of contents payments of principal on the a r loans are due as follows on september  for fiscal years ending may in thousands tranche a tranche b the closing of the remaining percent acquisition of hc triggered a bonus program for substantially all of hc s approximately  employees 
this program  which was implemented by huawei and com in a prior period  is called the equity appreciation rights plan  or earp  and funds a bonus pool based upon a percentage of the appreciation in hc s value from the initiation of the program to the time of the closing of the acquisition

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements for additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest to be paid by us on our senior secured loan is at an interest rate based  at our option  on either the libor or the prime rate  plus an applicable margin 
we expect the base interest rate generally to be based on the published libor rate  which is subject to change on a periodic basis 
recently  interest rates have trended upwards in major global financial markets 
if these interest rate trends continue  this will result in increased interest rate expense as a result of higher libor rates 
continued increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  particularly if such increases are substantial 
in addition  interest rate trends could affect global economic conditions 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on corporate financial results by hedging existing foreign currency exposures and anticipated foreign currency transactions expected to occur within one month 
anticipated foreign currency transaction exposures with a maturity profile in excess of one month may be selectively hedged 
translation exposures are not hedged 
due to the limitations on converting renminbi  we are limited in our ability to engage in currency hedging activities in china 
although the impact of currency fluctuations of renminbi to date has been slight  fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical ten percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently we believe that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have had a material impact on our financial statements as of may
