item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent developments in july we announced the completion of patient enrollment in our pivotal phase iii trial with polyheme 
this was the first study in the united states to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oxygen carrying red blood cell substitute beginning at the scene of injury and continuing during transport and in the early hospital period 
we reported the preliminary top line results of our study in december and announced additional results from the study in may we are presently preparing a biologics license application  or bla  for polyheme for submission to the us food and drug administration  or fda 
we have submitted a detailed summary of our trial data to fda and have participated in a pre bla meeting with the agency 
our goal is to submit our bla to fda during the first half of calendar we also plan to request priority review of our bla 
we believe polyheme satisfies the stated criteria for priority review based on its potential to address an unmet medical need 

table of contents since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling  we will be required to prepare and submit a bla to fda and obtain regulatory approval from fda before polyheme can be sold commercially 
the fda regulatory process is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
we therefore cannot at this time reasonably estimate the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are described in the statements of operations in our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by 
during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  a decrease of  or  from fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  we concluded enrollment in our pivotal phase iii trial 
while clinical costs associated with the trial decreased  our efforts to prepare our manufacturing facility and submit our bla to fda increased 
the direct costs of the trial  hospital site activity and contract research activity totaled  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal additional fiscal costs were also recorded for science consulting  increased staff  benefit costs and production maintenance 
during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from the fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  an additional trial sites opened with the attendant community consultation  training and trial initiation costs 
patient enrollment likewise accelerated with more clinical sites open and more sites gaining experience with the trial protocol 
the direct costs of the trial  hospital site activity and contract research activity totaled  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal additional costs were also recorded for increasing staff  benefit costs  insurance and science consulting 
we anticipate a continued high level of research and development spending in fiscal following completion of enrollment in our pivotal phase iii trial in fiscal  we have accelerated the significant task of data audit  assembly  analysis and report preparation 
preparing our bla for polyheme to be submitted to fda will continue through fiscal at the same time  we will be undergoing an extensive process of preparation for fda s pre approval inspection of our pilot manufacturing facility 
northfield s internal research and development resources will be focused on these tasks and we expect to expand the use of external resources to complete these tasks in a timely manner 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year totaled  an increase of  or  from the expenses incurred in the prior fiscal year 
significant increases in share based compensation 
table of contents expense and professional service fees occurred during fiscal effective june   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment 
among its provisions  sfas r requires us to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
we also incurred expenses for professional services in connection with a putative class action lawsuit that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we incurred increased expenses in fiscal for new software installation and our ongoing efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate a reduction in our general and administrative expenses due to an anticipated reduction in share based compensation and professional services fees in fiscal general and administrative expense for the fiscal year totaled  an increase of  or  from the expense incurred in the prior fiscal year 
significant increases in professional service fees and public relations expenses occurred during fiscal these expenses were mainly incurred in connection with an informal request from the staff of the sec to voluntarily provide certain information relating to the clinical development of polyheme in an elective surgery trial conducted between and we also provided similar information to the staff of the finance committee of the united states senate 
in addition  we incurred expenses for professional services in connection with a putative class action lawsuit that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal we anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the  incurred during fiscal a reduction in share based compensation  legal expenses and other professional service costs  such as consulting fees and corporate communications  is planned 
we are planning for a decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal of approximately to compared with our general and administrative expenses for fiscal interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  compared to  in fiscal the current year decrease is the result of lower available cash resources for investment 
available interest rates at the beginning of the current fiscal year were approximately for money market investments and for high quality one year securities 
money market rates in july were approximately and high quality three month securities were also around 
as our current investments mature  they will be rolled over until the funds are required for our business 
interest income in fiscal equaled  compared to  in fiscal the increase was the result of larger available cash resources as well as higher interest rates on our short term investments 
with declining available cash resources and short term interest rates perhaps nearing a peak  we anticipate that in the absence of a major cash infusion  interest income will decline in fiscal a one percent rate decline yields  less in interest income on a  investment over a month period 
net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  effective june   we adopted sfas r 
among its provisions  sfas r requires us to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
the increased net loss was primarily the result of increased share based compensation expenses and professional service fees as well as an increase in science consulting and production maintenance 
the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was primarily the result of increased clinical trial expenses and professional service fees 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the fiscal years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash utilization is due to the purchase of our manufacturing facility for  and to the payment of expenses related to our pivotal phase iii trial 
we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  as previously reported  we have been successful in securing a million federal appropriation as part of the defense appropriation bill in and a million federal appropriation as part of the fiscal defense appropriation bill 
as of may   we have received  of these funds 
we are currently utilizing our cash resources at a rate of approximately million per year 
we expect the rate at which we utilize our cash resources will remain constant in fiscal as we prepare to complete and submit a bla for polyheme to fda  and upgrade our manufacturing facility for fda inspection 
based on our current estimates  we believe our existing capital resources will be sufficient to permit us to conduct our operations  including the preparation and submission of a bla to fda  for approximately to months 
we may in the future issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funds or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
we are also pursuing potential sources of additional government funding 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the results of our clinical trial  as well as general conditions in the business and financial markets 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the timing and results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our planned commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policy reflects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual obligations total one year years lease obligations other obligations total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to three months base rent at any time after february  if the lease is cancelled as of february  unamortized broker commissions of  would also be due 
represents payments required to be made upon termination of employment agreements with two of our executive officers 
the employment contracts renew automatically unless terminated 
figures shown represent compensation payable upon the termination of the employment agreements for reasons other than death  disability  cause or voluntary termination of employment by the executive officer other than for good reason 
additional payments may be required under the employment agreements in connection with a termination of employment of the executive officer following a change in control of northfield 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
under sfas  a business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the requirements of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
the intent of sab is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements  including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and a cumulative balance sheet approach 
sab is effective for the fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin developed a two step process to evaluate a tax position and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease in the interest rate received over a one year period on our cash and marketable securities of  at may  would decrease interest income by
