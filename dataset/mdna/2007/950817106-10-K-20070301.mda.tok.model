item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview the principal goal of wesco s management is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions  nor do fluctuations in annual net income 
to accomplish desired growth  a high priority is placed on the purchases of companies having excellent economic characteristics  run by outstanding managers 
management strives also to invest in common stocks of outstanding publicly traded companies at prices deemed reasonable 
in the event that such investments are not available  as has often been the case in recent years  capital is preserved through investments principally in high quality cash equivalents and securities of the us government and its agencies 
wesco s operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis 
there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions such as sales  marketing  purchasing  legal or human resources and there is minimal involvement by wesco s management in the day to day business activities of the operating businesses 
wesco s chairman  president and chief executive officer  charles t 
munger  is also vice chairman of berkshire hathaway  and consults with warren e 
buffett  chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway  with respect to wesco s investment decisions  major capital allocations  and the selection of the chief executives to head each of wesco s operating units  subject to ultimate approval of wesco s board of directors 
the operations of wesco s wesco financial insurance company wes fic subsidiary are managed by berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company nico subsidiary 
wes fic participates principally in reinsurance contracts in which nico and other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate in the reinsurance of property and casualty risks of unaffiliated insurance companies 
terms of wes fic s participation are essentially identical to those by which the other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate  except as to the percentages of participation see item  business  for further information 
financial information relative to these participations appearing in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated financial statements  is identified as affiliated business 
financial condition wesco continues to have a strong balance sheet at december   with relatively low debt and no hedging 
liquidity  which has traditionally been high  has been even higher than usual for the past three years following sales  maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity investments  the proceeds from which have not yet been reinvested for the long term 
wesco s equity investments are in strong  well known companies 
the practice of concentrating in a few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire hathaway  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
results of operations wesco s consolidated net income has often fluctuated significantly from year to year as a result of the realization of gains on investments 
although there were no realized gains or losses in or  wesco s consolidated net income for included realized investment gains of million million  after income taxes resulting principally from the exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with pg s acquisition of gillette in the fourth quarter of the varying effect upon wesco s pre tax and net income is evident on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
the 
table of contents amount of realized gain or loss has no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio at each balance sheet date 
wesco s after tax income  excluding realized investment gains  increased by million for the year  due mainly to improved operating results of the furniture rental business and increased investment income earned by the insurance businesses  partially offset by decreased net underwriting gains 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up million from the billion per share at december  wesco s consolidated balance sheet reflects investments carried at fair values  with unrealized appreciation  net of deemed applicable income taxes  included as a component of shareholders equity 
upon completion of pg s acquisition of gillette on october   the after tax gain of million  which had been included in the unrealized gain component at september   was reclassified to retained earnings  another component of wesco s shareholders equity 
principally as a result  unrealized appreciation  which amounted to of shareholders equity at december   declined to of shareholders equity at december   without significant economic effect 
the unrealized gain component of wesco s shareholders equity at december   amounted to 
the increase in the figure for the year resulted principally from appreciation in fair values of investments 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  of these amounts  million and million related to a million revolving credit facility used in cort s furniture rental business 
in addition to this recorded debt  wesco and its subsidiaries had million of operating lease and other contractual obligations at december   versus million one year earlier 
see the section on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on debt 
wesco s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  totaled million versus million at december  wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations wesco s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how wesco s top management views those business activities 
wesco s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations underwriting and investing  and believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of their financial performance 
underwriting gain or loss represents the simple arithmetic difference between the following line items appearing on the consolidated statement of income insurance premiums earned  less insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and insurance underwriting expenses 
management s goal is to generate underwriting gains over the long term 
underwriting results are evaluated without allocation of investment income 
the consolidated data in the second table in item are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenues  including realized net investment gains  are followed by costs and expenses  and a provision for income taxes  to arrive at net income 
the following summary sets forth the after tax contribution to gaap net income of each business segment insurance  furniture rental and industrial as well as activities not considered related to such segments 
realized net investment gains are excluded from

year ended december  insurance segment underwriting investment income furniture rental segment industrial segment nonsegment items other than investment gains realized investment gains consolidated net income in the following sections the data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 
insurance segment wesco engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks through wesco financial insurance company wes fic and the kansas bankers surety company kbs 
their operations are conducted or supervised by wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway  wesco s ultimate parent company 
in reinsurance activities  defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities are assumed 
in primary insurance activities  defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks are assumed 
for purposes of the following discussion  the results have been disaggregated between reinsurance and primary insurance activities 
following is a summary of the insurance segment s underwriting activities 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  insurance premiums written reinsurance primary total insurance premiums earned reinsurance primary total insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses underwriting gain  before income taxes reinsurance primary total income taxes underwriting gain 
table of contents the nature of wes fic s participation in the aviation related reinsurance contracts requires that estimates be made not only as to losses and expenses incurred  but also as to premiums written  due to a time lag in reporting by the ceding pools 
under the aviation related contracts  written premiums for  and totaled million  million and million and earned premiums were million  million and million 
the increases of in written premiums and in earned premiums under these contracts for were attributed principally to the higher level of wes fic s participation in the hull and liability pools in the current year as well as an increase in the volume of business written by the workers compensation pool 
prices in certain aviation markets have been declining  resulting in fewer opportunities to write business at prices considered acceptable 
of the increases of in aviation related written premiums and in earned premiums for  slightly higher volume and improved pricing were responsible for about half  the entry into the workers compensation pool in accounted for the remainder of the increase in written and earned premiums 
because insurance premiums are amortized into income ratably over the coverage period  fluctuations in earned premiums essentially follow the fluctuations of written premiums 
reinsurance activities have fluctuated from year to year as participations in reinsurance contracts have become available both through insurance subsidiaries of berkshire and otherwise 
the level of business written in future periods will vary  perhaps materially  based also upon market conditions and management s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates 
until late  wes fic participated in a multi year contract covering certain multi line property and casualty risks of a large  unaffiliated insurer under a contract entered into in that contract was commuted in the fourth quarter of  at which time wes fic paid the ceding company million  representing all unearned premiums  reduced by unamortized costs and expenses 
after the commutation  wes fic s obligation to indemnify with respect to any further insurance losses under the contract ceased 
under the contract  there was a net reduction in written premiums of million for  earned premiums were million 
written primary insurance premiums decreased by million for  after having increased by million for  from the comparable figure 
earned premiums decreased million for  after having increased million for increased costs of kbs s reinsurance purchases in  and intensified price competition  were the principal factors responsible for the decreases in written and earned primary insurance premiums for the increases in written and earned primary insurance premiums for were attributed principally to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds 
liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are recorded based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
depending on the type of loss being estimated  the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent  among other factors  upon the timing of the claim reporting by cedants and insureds  and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amounts through the loss adjustment process 
significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred 
claims that have occurred as of the balance sheet date have not all been reported  and if reported may not have been settled 
the time between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have fairly short claim tails  and  absent litigation  are reported and settled within no more than a few years after occurrence 
casualty losses usually have very long claim tails 
casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment  which contributes to extended claim tails 
claim tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices 
the loss and loss expense reserves reflected on the consolidated balance sheet include provision for those claims that have been reported referred to as case reserves and for those claims that have not been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
actual ultimate loss 
table of contents amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates  referred to as loss development  are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
wes fic and kbs do not use consultants to assist in reserving activities 
reinsurance wes fic s property and casualty loss reserves derive from individual risk  multi line and catastrophe reinsurance policies 
reserve amounts are based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies  whose reserving techniques vary 
wes fic necessarily relies in part on the judgment of ceding companies management  to which wes fic management may add additional ibnr reserves  which are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis based on wes fic management s judgment as to the likely impact on each contract of major events as they become known or the history of loss reserving by the ceding companies 
ceding companies report minimal detail to their reinsurers  such as data about most individual claims  case and ibnr reserves  dismissals and settlements 
ranges of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions are not prepared 
primary insurance property and casualty loss reserves from wesco s primary insurance activities derive from individual risk policies written by kbs 
reserve amounts are estimated by its management on a case by case basis  and estimates of ibnr reserves  which amounted to million at yearend  and  are based on management s judgment of the impact of current trends and other factors 
because of the low volume of losses reported annually  kbs management is intimately familiar with each  negating the need for extended actuarial studies and broad estimates of the nature typically performed by large primary insurers whose business volume requires such procedures for the development of their loss data 
a range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared 
for  and  reinsurance generated underwriting gains of million  million and million  before income taxes 
the figure reflects the softening of prices in terms of premiums charged throughout  as well as increased aviation losses and related expenses resulting mainly from an increase in claims in the second half of the year 
the figure reflects estimated losses of million related to hurricane katrina  which struck the gulf coast of the united states in the third quarter 
included in the figure was a pre tax underwriting gain of million including million in the fourth quarter associated with the aforementioned commuted contract as well as an estimated loss of million relating to hurricanes that struck the southeastern united states that year 
excluding underwriting results attributable to the commuted contract in  pre tax underwriting gains from reinsurance for that year amounted to million 
the underwriting gains include favorable unfavorable reserve development of million for  comprised of unfavorable development of million attributable to the aviation related contracts  partially offset by million of favorable development for a contract whose coverage period ended in  million for  attributable to the aviation related contracts  and million for  consisting of favorable development of million relating to a contract whose coverage period expired in  less million of unfavorable aviation related reserve development 
management believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of financial performance of insurance companies 
when stated as a percentage  the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses  divided by premiums  gives the combined ratio 
a combined ratio of less than connotes an underwriting profit and a combined ratio of greater than connotes an underwriting loss 
excluding the results from the contract commuted in  combined ratios from reinsurance activities were  and for  and  which management considers to have been favorable 
the figure reflects mainly the detrimental effects caused by the softening of premium rates  as well as less favorable claims experience with respect to the hull and liability contracts  whose participation increased by percent for that year 
the figure reflects estimated losses of million  before taxes  related to hurricane katrina 

table of contents underwriting results from primary insurance have also been favorable but have fluctuated from year to year as shown in the preceding table  due to timing and volatility of losses incurred 
in  pre tax underwriting results declined by million  after having improved by million for kbs combined ratios  net of unfavorable loss development of million for  and million each for and  were  and for those respective years 
wesco s insurers cede minimal amounts of business  and as a result underwriting results may be volatile 
instead of paying reinsurers substantial amounts to minimize risks associated with significant losses  management accepts volatility in underwriting results provided the prospects of long term underwriting profitability remain favorable 
in addition  reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
the income tax provision associated with the insurance segment s underwriting activities for benefited by million relating to the resolution of an issue raised in an examination of prior year income tax returns by the internal revenue service 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
it should be noted that the commutation of the multi line property and casualty contract in resulted in the return to the ceding company of all remaining liability relating to the terrorist activity of september  in spite of partial relief provided to the insurance industry by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in and amended by the terrorism risk extension act of  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted 
management  however  does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wesco s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
losses from terrorism could  however  significantly impact wesco s periodic reported earnings 
other industry concerns in recent years have been exposures to losses relating to environmental contamination and asbestos 
management currently believes such exposures to be minimal 
following is a summary of investment income produced by wesco s insurance segment in thousands of dollars 
year ended december  investment income  before taxes income taxes investment income  after taxes investment income of the insurance segment comprises dividends and interest earned principally from the investment of shareholder capital including reinvested earnings as well as float principally  premiums received before payment of related claims and expenses 
pre tax investment income increased million for  and million for  from the corresponding prior year figures 
these increases were due principally to higher interest rates earned on short term investments 
dividend income improved slightly in each year 
the foregoing figures demonstrate the dramatic effect of the increases in short term interest rates in the united states since mid rates increased from approximately  to approximately  and have recently become relatively stable 
changes in rates in are not likely to affect investment income of the segment as dramatically or significantly as the changes since the company continues to seek to invest cash balances in the purchase of businesses and in long term equity holdings 
however  absent such opportunities  investment income is likely to remain relatively stable 

table of contents wesco s insurance subsidiaries  as a matter of practice  maintain liquidity in amounts which exceed by wide margins expected near term requirements for payment of claims and expenses 
as a result  it would be unlikely that any unanticipated payment of claims or expenses would require the liquidation of investments at a loss 
wesco does not attempt to match long term investment maturities to estimated durations of claim liabilities 
reference is made to the table of contractual obligations appearing elsewhere in this item for an indication of the periods in which the insurance segment s losses and loss expenses are expected to be paid 
furniture rental segment following is a summary of the results of operations of cort business services corporation cort  wesco s furniture rental segment 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues furniture rentals furniture sales service fees cost of rentals  sales and fees selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense income before income taxes income taxes segment net income furniture rental revenues for increased million from those of  after increasing million for  from those of excluding rental revenues from trade shows and locations not in operation throughout each year  rental revenues for increased from those of  following an increase of approximately in the preceding year 
the number of furniture leases outstanding at yearend was about lower than at yearend  following a decline of in the preceding year 
the decrease for was attributed mainly to softening of the housing market  which led to lower residential demand  the decrease for was attributed principally to non renewals by customers of a competitor acquired in the later half of despite the continued decline in the number of furniture leases  the furniture rental segment has experienced continued revenue growth in the past two years due mainly to improved pricing and  in  to increased tradeshow demand 
furniture sales revenues decreased in following an increase of in the sales volume is dependent on several factors  including the selection and quantity of furniture available for sale  as well as initiatives taken by management from time to time mainly through reduced selling prices 
the decrease in revenues in was attributed to a variety of factors  principally the softening of the housing market and the closing of one retail location 
the increase in furniture sales revenues in was attributed principally to a stronger economy as well as the initiatives taken during the year to reduce inventory 
the year to year fluctuations are not considered significant 
service fees for decreased million from those reported for  and by million in from those of the decline in service fee revenues in recent years was principally the result of the effort to significantly reduce apartment locator related losses by reducing apartment locator related costs 
the decreases in service fee revenues have been more than 
table of contents offset by reductions in related costs and expenses 
traditionally  the furniture segment has concentrated the marketing efforts of its relocation services towards individual residential customers 
in the fourth quarter of cort began a new initiative to expand the variety of its relocation services  and it redirected the thrust of this specialty towards corporate relocation departments see item  business 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for  versus for and for the decreasing costs as percentages of revenues have been due principally to revenue growth and improvement in revenue mix  with a larger percentage of each successive year s revenue attributable to furniture rentals  which has a higher margin than furniture sales 
selling  general  administrative and interest expenses operating expenses for the segment were million for  up from the million incurred for  following an increase of from the million incurred for the increase in these expenses in was attributed principally to personnel related expenses and advertising costs  offset by a decrease in restructuring expenses related to the apartment locator business 
in  total operating expenses remained relatively stable due mainly to aggressive restructuring of the apartment locator related expenses  employee headcount management and substantial improvements in occupancy expenses  essentially offset by an increase in transportation and storage costs primarily associated with the increase in the cost of fuel 
operating expenses as percentages of revenues decreased to in from in and in furniture rental segment net income amounted to million in  million in and million in the improvements in each succeeding year resulted significantly from increasing revenues  changes in revenue mix  and the continued focus on controlling operating expenses 
the furniture segment s tax provision and net income for the year ended december  benefited by million relating to an adjustment of a prior year tax reserve 
industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services income before income taxes income taxes segment net income for several years prior to  the operations of the industrial segment suffered due to various factors including the following a prolonged economic downturn  a shift of production by many manufacturers from domestic to overseas facilities  periodic shortages of product from domestic mills  and extraordinary competitive pressures 
not only was there a decline in the number of orders placed  but there was also a trend towards smaller sized orders 
the severity of the impact on the industrial segment s business is demonstrated by the fact that average annual segment revenues of million for the years through were down from those reported for through at the beginning of  a shortage of raw materials from domestic mills produced near chaos in the steel service industry 
customers wishing to avoid running out of stock accelerated their purchasing  exacerbating the tumult 
as the year progressed  domestic steel mills were operating at capacity and imported steel was not readily available 
these and other factors enabled the mills to raise prices  place limits on order quantities and extend delivery times 
precision steel reacted by 
table of contents passing the price increases  plus normal mark ups  on to its customers 
thus  for the year  pounds of steel products sold increased and segment revenues increased million  pre tax and net income improved by million and million  respectively  over pre tax and after tax losses realized by precision steel in throughout  supplies of product from domestic mills became more readily available  demand softened  competitive pressures increased  and mills lowered prices  although such prices remained approximately higher than they had been two years earlier 
segment revenues for increased million  or  from those of  despite a year to year decrease in pounds of steel sold 
the year started out well  volume for the first quarter increased by over the comparable figure for the first quarter of  however  as the year progressed  increasing competitive pressures and a slowdown in domestic manufacturing activity caused volume to decline and  by yearend  volume for the year  in terms of pounds sold  was lower than for segment revenues  however  increased by million for the year 
approximately half of the increase was attributable to an extraordinarily large sale of toolroom supplies to a single customer by precision steel s precision brand products subsidiary in the first quarter 
excluding that transaction  segment revenues for increased by million over those of a change in the mix of products sold was principally responsible for the anomalous increase in revenues 
for  pre tax income decreased by million from the corresponding figure  while net income remained approximately unchanged 
for  pre tax income increased by million  and net income increased by million 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold included adverse lifo inventory accounting adjustments of million million  after income taxes for  million million  after income taxes for and million million  after income taxes for despite these adjustments  cost of sales  which  in previous years tended to fluctuate more dramatically from year to year than in recent years  amounted to  and of revenues for  and  reflecting mainly customers acceptance of price increases in view of periodic metal shortages 
despite improved results in recent years  management is concerned that the steel warehouse business may revert to the difficult times that prevailed prior to as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  precision steel and a subsidiary are involved in environmental litigation  the ultimate cost of which is difficult to estimate 
the foregoing segment operating results reflect costs relating to this matter  less insurance reimbursements received  as follows net costs of million million  after taxes for and million million  after taxes for  and a net benefit of million million  after taxes for had it not been for these environmental litigation related costs and benefit  pre tax and net income reported for the industrial segment for would have increased by million million  after taxes for  and by million million  after taxes for  over the segment net income figures reported for each respective prior year 
management anticipates that additional provisions and legal fees with respect to environmental remediation may be required in the future 
however  as of december   it was not possible to reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of additional costs or a range of costs  that may be required in connection with the matter 
although management does not anticipate that the ultimate impact of such provisions and costs  net of future insurance recoveries  if any  will be material in relation to wesco s shareholders equity  it believes that the effect on industrial segment and consolidated net income in any given period could be material 

table of contents unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing or decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  realized investment gains  before income tax effect income taxes realized investment gains other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate dividend and interest income real estate and general and administrative expenses income loss before income taxes income taxes net income from other nonsegment activities management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
investment gains may also derive from non cash exchanges of securities for other investment securities as a result of merger activity involving the investees 
wesco s consolidated earnings contained net realized investment gains of million million  after taxes 
of that amount  million  after taxes  resulted from wesco s non cash exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with the purchase of gillette by pg in the fourth quarter 
the million excess of fair value of the shares exchanged over wesco s original cost basis was recorded by wesco as a realized investment gain on october  the date of the transaction  as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
although the gain had a material impact on wesco s reported earnings for the fourth quarter of  there was no effect on shareholders equity 
wesco carried its investment in gillette at market value with unrealized gains reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the net unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity  as of september  federal income taxes are not currently payable as a result of the exchange 
no investment gains or losses were realized in or other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
these taxes do not typically correlate well with total pre tax income  principally because dividend income is taxed at a very low rate 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  wesco and its ms property company subsidiary reduced their liabilities for deferred income taxes by an aggregate of million 
that amount is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense of activities unrelated to business segments  shown in the preceding table  as well as an increase in after tax income  for the fourth quarter as well as the year 

table of contents consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of investment gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as a large acquisition 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as the september  terrorist activity  which had an immediate impact on wes fic s underwriting results  and changes in the economy  which have significantly affected cort and precision steel in recent years 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed below 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or notes thereto 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain of those obligations  such as notes payable  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations as of december  follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total subsequently notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations payment of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures construction of condominiums other  principally deferred compensation totals amounts and timing of payments are significantly dependent on estimates 
see critical accounting policies and practices below 
critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to the determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period reported upon 
in particular  estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of many years 
the estimates and assumptions are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances using information available at the time such estimates and assumptions are made 
the amounts of such assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available 
although wesco s management does not believe such changes in estimates would have a materially adverse effect on shareholders equity  they could produce a material effect on results of operations in a reporting period 
investments the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years  all equity and fixed maturity investments have been classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
rental furniture rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive in quantity  for sale 
rental furniture is carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
revenue recognition insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring premiums are deferred in other assets on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contract period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon passage of title to the customer  which coincides with product shipment  delivery or acceptance  depending on the sales arrangement 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of that date  some incurred claims have not yet been reported and some of these may not be reported for many years  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims 
liabilities for insurance losses are determined from individual case amounts  reports from ceding insurers  and past experience 
considerable 
table of contents judgment is required to evaluate claims and estimate claims liabilities in connection with reinsurance contracts because of the inherent delays in receiving loss information from ceding companies 
as further data become available  the liabilities are reevaluated and adjusted as appropriate 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
goodwill goodwill of acquired businesses represents the excess of the cost of acquired entities principally cort over the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter of each year using a variety of methods that require that certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding economic factors and future profitability 
impairments  if any  are charged to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
apart from investments  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained billion of marketable equity securities stated at market value  up from million one year earlier 
the increase was due to an increase in market values as well as the purchase of securities at cost of million during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the procter gamble company and the coca cola company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in the filings these companies make with the sec  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and 
table of contents management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity as well as much liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained billion of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  versus billion of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities one year earlier 
consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or other factors as of december  are considered insignificant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions
