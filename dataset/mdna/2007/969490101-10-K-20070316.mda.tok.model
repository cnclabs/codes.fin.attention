item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an oil and natural gas exploration  development  acquisition  and production company 
our basic business model is to find and develop oil and gas reserves through exploration and development activities  and sell the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
from time to time  we may also acquire producing properties if we believe the acquired assets offer us the potential for reserve growth through additional developmental or exploratory drilling activities 
we believe that the economic climate in the domestic oil and gas industry continues to be suitable for our business model 
although oil prices have retreated from their peaks in mid  and gas prices have been volatile  we believe that supply and demand fundamentals in the energy marketplace continue to provide us with the economic incentives necessary for us to assume the risks we face in our search for oil and gas reserves 
however  we are experiencing a shrinking profit margin related to rising drilling and production costs 
while profit margins still remain favorable  operating metrics per mcfe  such as finding costs  production costs and dd a expense  are rising 
finding quality domestic oil and gas reserves through exploration is a significant challenge and involves a high degree of risk 
we replaced approximately of our production through extensions and discoveries in  most of which were derived from drilling activities on our floyd prospect in south louisiana 
however  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a per mcfe of oil and gas production  an operating metric that measures a company s cumulative cost to find or purchase a unit of production  increased from to our planned exploration activities in offer us the opportunity to improve our dd a rate through the drilling of several potentially high impact wells  particularly in our east texas bossier area 
however  these wells are very expensive to drill and involve a high degree of risk 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for we spent million on exploration and development activities during  of which approximately was on exploratory prospects 
we currently plan to spend approximately million for the calendar year  of which approximately is estimated to be spent on exploratory prospects 
the expenditures exceeded our cash flow from operating activities by more than million 
our expenditures are also expected to exceed our cash flow from operating activities in  although not by as large a margin 
we cannot predict our drilling success on exploratory prospects  and our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unsuccessful exploratory drilling results 
during  we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million from million at december  to million at december  to partially finance our exploration and development activities 
as of february   our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility had increased to million due to additional borrowings to finance our exploration program and to pay interest on our senior notes 
despite our high level of capital spending in  our oil and gas production for was lower on an mcfe basis than in a significant portion of our expenditures have not resulted in current production because they relate to a unproved exploratory prospects  b drilling or completion activities that are in progress  or c non productive leasing and drilling activities 
at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
exploration costs related to abandonments and impairments were million in  of which approximately million related to unsuccessful well costs and million related to impairment of unproved acreage 
over of these costs were related to exploratory prospects in south louisiana  and approximately related to prospects in colorado and montana 
we recorded a million net gain on derivatives in as compared to a million loss in for  cash settlements to counterparties accounted for a million loss and changes in mark to market valuations accounted for a million gain 
since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations 
we recorded a million impairment of proved properties in due to the combined effects of lower commodity prices and lower reserve estimates 
the impairment applied to several areas in the permian basin and one prospect in south louisiana 
our proved oil and gas reserves at december  were bcfe compared to bcfe at december  we added bcfe through extensions and discoveries  and lost bcfe through net downward revisions 
proved oil and gas reserves the following table summarizes changes in our proved reserves during on a bcfe basis 
bcfe total proved reserves  december  purchases of minerals in place extensions and discoveries revisions production total proved reserves  december  during  we replaced of the bcfe that we produced in  computed by dividing the sum of all net reserve additions purchases of minerals in place  extensions and discoveries  and revisions  by production 
we use this reserve replacement ratio as a benchmark for determining the sources through which we have expanded or contracted our base of proved reserves 
following is a discussion of the important factors related to each source of net reserve additions during purchases of minerals in place 
we purchased bcfe of reserves in relating to properties in california and west texas 
although we are continually looking for acquisitions  we cannot predict the likelihood of adding any reserves in through purchases of minerals in place 
extensions and discoveries 
our extensions and discoveries during consist of proved reserves attributable directly to the drilling of discovery wells primarily in south louisiana and the permian basin 
of the bcfe of additions  substantially all are proved developed reserves 
due to the nature of exploratory drilling  we cannot predict the extent to which we will add any reserves in through extensions and discoveries 
revisions 
our proved reserves were bcfe lower due to revisions of previous estimates 
downward revisions of bcfe were attributable to the effects of lower product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves  and downward revisions of approximately bcfe were attributable to lower well performance  primarily in the permian basin 
gas prices at december  were approximately half of the prices at december   contributing to the downward price revision 
in addition  higher projected operating costs were responsible for a portion of the decrease

operating results compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in decreased million  or  from  of which production variances accounted for a million decrease and price variances accounted for a million increase 
production in on an mcfe basis was lower than oil production decreased and gas production decreased in as compared to due primarily to natural production declines  offset in part by new production from our exploration and development activities 
in  our realized oil price was higher than  while our realized gas price was lower 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased in as compared to due primarily to higher oilfield service costs 
after giving effect to a decline in oil and gas production on an mcfe basis  production costs per mcfe increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in it is likely that these factors will continue to contribute to higher production costs in future periods 
dd a expense increased from million in to million in dd a expense attributable to oil and gas properties increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
on an mcfe basis  dd a expense increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in dd a per mcfe of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production 
unless our exploration activities result in an improvement in our finding costs in  we may continue to realize higher dd a rates in future periods 
we recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties under sfas of million during due to the combination of production performance and lower commodity prices 
this provision was attributable to two areas in the permian basin and one area in south louisiana 
we recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties of million in gain on property sales gain on sales of property and equipment in was million as compared to million in the gain in was derived from the sale of other property and equipment 
most of the gain in related to the sale of our interests in two leases in the breton sound area of the gulf of mexico 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in most of the costs were incurred in louisiana  the permian basin  montana and colorado 
at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in fiscal  of which approximately is expected to be allocated to exploration activities 
since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of the costs we incur in fiscal will be charged to exploration costs 
however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased from million in to million in excluding non cash employee compensation  g a expenses increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher personnel costs and professional fees attributable to the increase in overall drilling and exploration activities 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based employee compensation 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge for stock based employee compensation and a  non cash charge related to our after payout incentive plan 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in due to several factors 
in july  we issued million of senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of  and used the proceeds to repay our then outstanding bank indebtedness 
as a result  the period included a non cash charge of million of debt issue costs related to the early repayment of our senior term credit facility and the reduction in our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
in  we used our revolving loan facility to partially finance our exploration and development activities 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for was million compared to million for  however  the senior notes were outstanding for the entire period 
capitalized interest for was million compared to million in gain loss on derivatives we recorded a gain on derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million for we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as gain loss on derivatives 
cash settlements were million in  as compared to million in we recorded a gain on derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million in resulting from mark to market valuations 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate in of differed from the statutory federal rate of due primarily to a reduction in our state tax provision of million related to the adoption of texas house bill in may our income tax benefit in of  differed from the statutory federal benefit due primarily to the utilization of tax depletion in excess of basis 
compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the comparative period in oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in increased million  or  from  of which price variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
production in on an mcfe basis was lower than oil production increased in from due primarily to additional well production from our southwest royalties  inc swr acquisition in may  offset in part by lost production as a result of hurricane katrina 
gas production decreased due primarily to lost production from the hurricane and declines in the cotton valley reef complex area due to formation performance 
in  our realized oil price was higher than  while our realized gas price was higher 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased in as compared to due primarily to higher oilfield service costs and increased workover activities 
also contributing to the added expense was the addition of higher cost oil properties acquired in connection with the swr acquisition  as well as increased production tax costs related to higher product prices 
after giving effect to a decline in oil and gas production on an mcfe basis  production costs per mcfe increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in dd a expense increased from million in to million in dd a expense attributable to oil and gas properties increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a  decrease 
on an mcfe basis  dd a expense increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in depletion rates for each depletable group are a function of net capitalized costs and estimated reserve quantities 
we recorded a provision for impairment of proved properties under sfas of million during due to the combination of production performance and lower commodity prices 
this provision was attributable to the wolfcamp exploration program in the permian basin 
gain loss on property sales gain on sales of property and equipment in was million as compared to million in the gain in was from the sale of our interests in two leases in the breton sound area in the gulf of mexico 
the gain in related to the sale of the jo mill unit in borden county  texas 
in  we also recorded a loss on sale of property and equipment of million  consisting primarily of the sale of the romere pass unit in plaquemines parish  louisiana 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in most of the and costs were incurred in south louisiana and mississippi 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses increased from million in to million in excluding non cash employee compensation  g a expenses increased from million in to million in due to higher personnel costs and professional fees attributable to the increase in overall drilling and exploration activities 
in  we recorded a  non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and million for stock based employee compensation 
in  we recorded a  non cash credit for stock based employee compensation 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in due to several factors 
in july  we issued million of senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of  and used the proceeds to repay our then outstanding bank indebtedness 
as a result  the period included a non cash charge of million of debt issue costs related to the early repayment of our senior term credit facility and the reduction in our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under our bank credit facility for was million compared to million for  however  the senior notes were outstanding for almost half of the period 
higher effective interest rates on our bank credit facilities also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
capitalized interest for was million compared to  in gain loss on derivatives we recorded a loss on derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million for we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as losses on derivatives 
cash settlements were million in  as compared to million in we recorded a loss on derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million in resulting from mark to market valuations 
income tax expense benefit our income tax benefit in of  differed from the statutory federal benefit due primarily to the utilization of tax depletion in excess of basis 
our income benefit in was substantially equal to the statutory federal rate of since the benefit derived from the utilization of tax depletion in excess of basis was offset by a provision for state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our revolving credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our exploration program  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the revolving credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
in  we issued million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes and used the net proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility at that time 
however  we relied heavily on advances under the revolving credit facility to finance a significant portion of our exploration and development activities in at december   we had million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
our expenditures exceeded cash flow from operating activities by more than million 
our expenditures are also expected to exceed our cash flow from operating activities in  although not by as large a margin 
we cannot predict our drilling success on exploratory prospects  and our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unsuccessful exploratory drilling results 
in this section  we will describe our current plans for capital spending  identify the capital resources available to finance our capital spending  and discuss the principal factors that can affect our liquidity and capital resources 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes  by area  our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during  as compared to our actual expenditures in actual planned expenditures expenditures year ended year ended percentage december  december  of total in thousands south louisiana north louisiana permian basin east texas bossier utah montana austin chalk trend colorado other our actual expenditures during fiscal may be substantially higher or lower than these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during fiscal approximately of the planned expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset the higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates do not include costs we may incur to complete any future successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
we cannot predict our drilling success on exploratory prospects  and our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unsuccessful exploratory drilling results 
we spent million on exploration and development activities during  of which approximately was on exploratory prospects 
we currently plan to spend approximately million for the calendar year  of which approximately is estimated to be spent on exploratory prospects 
the expenditures exceeded our cash flow from operating activities by more than million 
our expenditures are also expected to exceed our cash flow from operating activities in  although not by as large a margin 
we intend to finance this shortfall by borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that the amount of funds available to us under our revolving credit facility  when combined with our anticipated operating cash flow  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures and will provide us with adequate liquidity at least through although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  uncertainties exist which could cause the borrowing base to be less than expected  cash flow to be less than expected  or capital expenditures to be more than expected 
we have placed orders for two  horsepower rigs for possible use in our bossier drilling program in north louisiana and east texas 
at december   we had invested million in these rigs and were committed under firm purchase contracts for an additional million 
we estimate that the combined construction cost of both rigs will be approximately million  and currently plan to seek financing for most of the remaining cost of these rigs 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million  or  as compared to the corresponding period in due to the combined effects of several factors 
oil and gas sales  net of production costs  general and administrative costs and interest expense  were million lower in as compared to the same period in our primary source of cash from operating activities is our oil and gas sales  net of production costs 
our cash flow provided by operating activities is subject to material variation from changes in oil and gas production levels and product prices 
settlements on derivative contracts  excluding those contracts that contain a financing element as in the case of the contracts assumed in our acquisition of southwest royalties  inc in may  were substantially the same in both periods 
interest expense increased in due primarily to higher levels of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of the senior notes 
credit facility a group of banks have provided us with a revolving credit facility on which we have historically relied for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this revolving credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under this credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
at the beginning of  we had an outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility of million  and the borrowing base was million  providing us with available funds of million after accounting for outstanding letters of credit 
in june  the borrowing base was increased to million 
during  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and received cash proceeds of million from sales of assets and issuances of common stock 
we also spent million on capital expenditures excluding larclay jv and paid million to settle derivatives with financing elements 
to finance the excess of expenditures over cash flow  we borrowed million on the revolving credit facility 
using the revolving credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the revolving credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the revolving credit facility requires us to i include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  ii exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  and iii exclude current maturities of vendor finance obligations  if any  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our reported working capital deficit decreased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to a combination of factors  including increases in fair value of derivatives and increases in receivables  offset in part by increases in payables and current maturities of long term debt 
after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities exclude current assets and current liabilities of larclay jv working capital per loan covenant since we use this revolving credit facility for both short term liquidity and long term financing needs  it is important that we comply in all material respects with the loan agreement  including financial covenants that are computed quarterly 
the working capital covenant requires us to maintain positive working capital using the computations described above 
another financial covenant under the credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow of no more than to while we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december   our increased leverage and reduced liquidity may result in our failing to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to allow us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
the banks redetermine the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility at least twice a year  in may and november 
the november borrowing base review resulted in maintaining the borrowing base at million 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
we relied heavily on advances under the revolving credit facility to finance a significant portion of our exploration and development activities in at december   we had million outstanding on the revolving credit facility  as compared to million on february  the increased borrowings since december  were required to finance our exploration program and to pay interest on our senior notes 
senior notes due in july  we issued  in a private placement  million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and will bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning february  after the payment of typical transaction expenses  net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our secured credit facilities and for general corporate purposes  including the funding of planned exploration and development activities 
at any time prior to august   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  prior to august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  plus a make whole premium  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
on and after august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to for the twelve month period beginning on august   for the twelve month period beginning on august   and beginning on august   for any period thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to i borrow money  ii issue redeemable and preferred stock  iii pay distributions or dividends  iv make investments  v create liens without securing the notes  vi enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  vii sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  viii enter into transactions with affiliates  ix guarantee indebtedness  and x enter into new lines of business 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for both of our credit facilities  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or public or private issuances of common stock 
we could also issue senior or subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations and contingent commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  by payment due date 
payments due by period total to to and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations senior notes a secured bank credit facility a drilling contracts larclay jv note purchase commitments lease obligations total contractual obligations a in addition to the principal payments presented  we expect to make annual interest payments of million on the senior notes and approximately million on the secured bank credit facility based on the balances and interest rates at december  
excluded from the table above is our mark to market liability related to commodity and interest rate derivatives 
our derivative obligations  based on mark to market valuations at december   would mature as follows million  and million 
known trends and uncertainties oil and gas production as with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  we face the challenge of natural production decline since oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource 
with each unit of oil and gas we produce  we are depleting our proved reserve base  so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base 
our production has been on a gradual decline since due to the effects of natural production decline  offset in part by reserve additions through exploration and development and acquisitions 
in  we replaced more than of our oil and gas production through our exploratory drilling program 
production from these discoveries should contribute favorably to production in  and may help offset the natural production declines from our base of oil and gas reserves 
even with this new production  we will need to discover new sources of production from our exploration and development activities in while we cannot predict the results of our exploration and development activities  we believe that oil and gas production levels in will be comparable to those in profit margins we analyze  on an mcfe produced basis  those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas profit margin 
our weighted average oil and gas sales per mcfe have been on an upward trend  from per mcfe in  per mcfe in and per mcfe in higher product prices have provided us with a significant incentive to assume the risks associated with many of the exploratory prospects that we have initiated in the past three years 
however  our expenses per mcfe are also on an upward trend and is resulting in a narrowing profit margin 
our oil and gas dd a per mcfe has increased from per mcfe in  to per mcfe in  to in an upward trend in dd a per mcfe indicates that our cost to find and or acquire reserves is increasing at a faster rate than the reserves we are adding 
although we replaced approximately of our production in  our cost to find those reserves was higher than our historical combined rate 
also affecting our profit margin is the cost of producing our reserves 
our production costs per mcfe have risen from per mcfe in  to per mcfe in  to per mcfe in our rise in production costs per mcfe is a result of a combination of factors 
most of the increase in was attributable to the acquisition of mature permian basin properties that had a higher production cost profile than our then existing properties 
since the beginning of  we have experienced significant increases in the cost of field services to maintain and produce our production 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected successful efforts accounting reserve estimates oil and gas properties for oil and gas properties valuation of unproved properties accumulated dd a judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells provision for dd a impairment of unproved properties abandonment costs dry hole costs impairment of proved properties reserve estimates and related present value of oil and gas properties future net revenues accumulated dd a impairment of proved properties asset retirement obligations estimates of the present value of future abandonment costs abandonment obligations non current liability oil and gas properties accretion of discount expense dd a means depreciation  depletion and amortization 
significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
while we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment  it is possible that in exchanging information  our internal reservoir engineer could influence the independent engineer s estimates and assumptions 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed nonproducing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
standardized measure proved reserves average price of discounted oil a gas oil a gas future mmbbls bcf bbl mcf net cash flows in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
asset retirement obligations we are required by sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations to estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we compute our liability for asset retirement obligations by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations 
during  we revised our estimated asset retirement obligations by million  or approximately of the asset retirement obligations at december   based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion expense 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which becomes effective beginning on january  sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires an entity to evaluate the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on current year financial statements 
if a misstatement is material to the current year financial statements  the prior year financial statements should also be corrected  even though such revision was  and continues to be  immaterial to the prior year financial statements 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
such correction should be made in the current period filings 
the adoption of sab had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we plan to adopt sfas beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
emerging issues task force issue eitf  which became effective january   requires companies to fully consolidate any limited partnerships that the company controls as general partner 
eitf presumes that a sole general partner in a limited partnership controls the limited partnership  however  the presumption of control can be overcome if the limited partners have i the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner or otherwise dissolve the limited partnership or ii substantive participating rights 
for this purpose  the eitf has concluded that a general partner lacks control if the limited partners can remove the general partner with a simple majority vote 
we have entered into contracts with oil and gas limited partnerships of which we are the sole general partner 
generally  these contracts require us to abstain from voting any of our limited partnership units in matters related to our removal as general partner 
as a result  the limited partners in all of the oil and gas partnerships in which we serve as general partner can remove us as general partner with a simple majority vote 
accordingly  we have continued consolidating our proportionate share of all of these limited partnerships 
the adoption of eitf had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin to clarify the manner in which enterprises account for uncertainties in their provisions for income taxes 
generally  the standard presented by fin is a more likely than not standard and is intended to enhance the relevancy and comparability of financial reporting by companies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in the price per bbl of oil and a 
drop in the price per mcf of gas from year end would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a combination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning the company s net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december  the settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on nymex futures prices

a per barrel change in the price of oil and a 
per mmbtu change in the price of gas would change the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  by approximately million 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on our long term debt with a variable interest rate 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value 
at december   our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million  based on current market quotes 
we estimate that the hypothetical change in the fair value of our long term debt resulting from a basis point change in interest rates would be approximately million 
we are a party to interest rate swaps that were acquired in connection with the swr acquisition 
under these derivatives  we pay a fixed rate for the notional principal balances and receive a floating market rate based on libor
