table of contents united states net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
this growth reflected increased sales to several customers within the wireline networking sector including juniper 
operating income for fiscal declined million from fiscal  due to an unfavorable customer mix  lower pricing  a million warranty related charge and million write down of inventories in the second quarter of fiscal due to financial concerns about a customer 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we partially offset the inventory write down discussed above due to recognition of million of revenue associated with the cash collection and subsequent shipments of this customer s inventory which resulted in a pre tax net impact recovery of million 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
this growth reflected increased sales to several customers including juniper  general electric corp 
ge and a new customer within the defense sector 
operating income for fiscal improved million over fiscal  primarily as a result of increased net sales on a relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure  favorable changes in customer mix and continued operational improvements 
asia net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
this growth reflected increased demand from wireline networking  wireless infrastructure and medical customers as well as the transfer of a medical program from the united states 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal earnings benefited from the incremental net sales and the operating efficiencies from the higher production levels 
expansion of operating income was moderated by the increased fixed manufacturing costs associated with the expansion of facilities as well as additional selling and administrative costs incurred to support the revenue growth 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million as our facilities in this low cost region became an increasingly important source for printed circuit board assemblies pcba s 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal earnings benefited from the incremental net sales and the turnaround from a loss to a profit at our second facility in penang  which began production in the first quarter of fiscal and incurred start up losses through much of fiscal mexico net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the decline in net sales was related to a wireless infrastructure customer going end of life as well as reduced demand from an industrial customer that is expected to disengage in the near future 
operating losses widened million as a result of the reduction in net sales and the write down of million of inventory for customers going end of life 
we currently do not expect this reportable segment to attain break even operating income in fiscal however  it is our goal to significantly narrow the loss in fiscal and potentially reach monthly break even status late in fiscal net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the decline in net sales was principally related to the decision of a medical customer to transfer production back to a plexus facility located in the united states as well as lower demand from current customers and the disengagement of other customers 
the decrease in net sales resulted in an operating loss of million for fiscal europe net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the revenue decline was attributable to three programs going end of life 
operating income increased million or percent  to million for fiscal due to the reduced fixed manufacturing and administrative costs associated with the closure of the maldon  england maldon facility in the second quarter of fiscal as well as the recognition of million of revenue related to the cash collection and subsequent shipment of previously written down inventory for a financially distressed customer in fiscal net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the net sales decline was attributable to reduced demand from a medical customer in fiscal operating income decreased million or percent  to million for fiscal lower operating income was related to lower net sales and the write down of inventory to its net realizable value for a financially distressed customer 
for our significant customers  we generally manufacture products in more than one location 
net sales to juniper  our largest customer  occur in the united states and asia 
net sales to ge  another significant customer  occur in the united states  asia  mexico and europe

table of contents the effective income tax rates for fiscal  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the fiscal income tax benefit reflects a reduction in the valuation allowance on us deferred income tax assets of million as well as increased pre tax income in malaysia and china  where we currently have tax holidays which extend through and  respectively 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately percent due to the mix of pre tax income expected to occur in each tax jurisdiction 
china and mexico have passed new tax laws which are expected to take effect on january  these new laws may result in higher tax rates on our operations in those countries 
our primary financial metric for measuring financial performance is after tax return on invested capital roic  which exceeded in fiscal our estimated percent weighted average cost of capital 
we define after tax roic as tax effected operating income  excluding unusual charges  divided by average capital employed over a rolling five quarter period  which is equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
after tax roic was percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 
see the table below for our roic calculation dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  october  operating income tax effected  excluding unusual charges average capital employed after tax roic fiscal outlook our financial goals for fiscal are to build on the prior year s achievements and to focus on attaining organic net sales growth and further improvements in operating income 
consistent with these goals  we are setting a percent to percent revenue growth objective for fiscal our start in our first fiscal quarter of suggests that the near term objective is achievable  yet we are mindful of growing economic uncertainty that could derail end market demand and actual results will depend on future events 
we currently expect the first quarter of fiscal net sales to be in the range of million and million  however  our results will ultimately depend upon the actual level of customer orders  which could vary 
based on orders received  this range includes anticipated net sales of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal for a program in the defense security aerospace sector 
in addition  we anticipate net sales of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal for this program 
although we have received follow on orders for delivery in the first and second quarters of fiscal totaling approximately million as noted above  net sales under this program are episodic  can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and may not represent a continuing stream of business 
we do not have visibility for this customer beyond the second quarter 
assuming that net sales are in the range noted above  we would currently expect to earn  before any restructuring and impairment costs  between to per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal see risk factors  in item a hereof  which sets forth some of the other factors which could effect our net sales  operations and earnings going forward 
facility closures expansions in fiscal  we announced our intention to close the maldon manufacturing facility and transition the customer programs to our kelso  scotland manufacturing facility 
the decision was the result of reduced customer demand in the united kingdom 
the maldon facility was closed in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we announced the purchase of a third manufacturing and engineering facility in penang 
the new facility provides an additional  square feet of manufacturing space 
the initial investment for the facility of approximately million was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  we began manufacturing in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we also announced the expansion of our manufacturing facility in xiamen by approximately  square feet 
this increased our manufacturing capacity at this facility to  square feet 
we expect to begin manufacturing in the additional space during the second quarter of fiscal

results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  october  increase decrease decrease net sales net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal the net sales growth reflected increased demand from several customers within the wireline networking sector  including juniper  our largest customer 
reduced demand from customers within the medical  the industrial commercial and the defense security aerospace sectors moderated the overall increase in fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal the net sales growth was due to increased demand from several of our customers 
net sales in the wireline networking sector grew in line with our overall growth rate of percent 
our growth in net sales in this sector was driven by increased revenues with our existing customers  including juniper  as well as the addition of new customers 
the largest percentage sales growth occurred in the defense security aerospace sector  where the growth was primarily attributable to a new major defense program in fiscal along with other gains from existing and new customers 
our net sales percentages by market sector for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  september  october  wireline networking wireless infrastructure medical industrial commercial defense security aerospace the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  september  october  juniper networks general electric top customers net sales to our customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements  terminations  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration has remained at or above percent during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end market demand and other factors 
any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector increases relative to other sectors  we become increasingly dependent upon economic and business conditions affecting that sector 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit and gross margins for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  october  increase decrease decrease gross profit gross margin for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors the inventory write downs of million in the us and mexican reportable segments recognition of million of revenue associated with the cash collection and subsequent shipments of previously written down inventory for two financially distressed customers in the us and european reportable segments million of warranty related expense in the us reportable segment an increase in fixed manufacturing costs as a result of our expansion in penang  malaysia and reduced net sales in the european and mexican reportable segments  changes in customer mix  price reductions and increased depreciation expense  all of which unfavorably impacted gross margins 
for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in the us and asia reportable segments favorable changes in the customer mix continued operating efficiencies at several manufacturing locations and a moderate increase in fixed manufacturing expense due to increased salaries and benefits for additional employees  as well as increased variable incentive and stock based compensation 
gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies attendant to the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price reductions  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
although we focus on maintaining gross margins  there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
most of the research and development we conduct is paid for by our customers and is  therefore  included in both net sales and cost of sales 
we conduct our own research and development  but that research and development is not specifically identified  and we believe such expenses are less than one percent of our net sales 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  october  increase decrease decrease s a percent of net sales the dollar increase in s a for fiscal was related to several factors that impacted compensation expense 
we added additional headcount to augment business development activities 
in addition  we were impacted by wage increases as well as incremental stock based compensation included in s a of million in fiscal offsetting these increases was variable incentive compensation included in s a  which decreased by million in fiscal 
table of contents from fiscal the decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due to a percent increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal the dollar increase in s a for fiscal was due to increased salaries and benefits  reflecting wage increases and additional expense for variable incentive and stock based compensation 
variable incentive compensation increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal stock based compensation included in s a was approximately million for fiscal there was no stock based compensation for fiscal these increases in s a were offset by the recovery of previously written off accounts receivable of approximately million as well as reduced spending of approximately million for external resources associated with sox in fiscal the decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due primarily to a percent increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal restructuring and impairment costs 
our restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  october  goodwill impairment lease exit costs and other asset impairments severance costs adjustments to lease exit costs other adjustments to asset impairments total restructuring and impairment costs the restructuring and impairment costs were associated with various reportable segments 
such costs were not allocated to our reportable segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the reportable segments

the details of these fiscal restructuring actions are listed below maldon facility closure the maldon facility ceased production on december   and the closure resulted in a workforce reduction of employees at a cost of million 
during the second fiscal quarter of  the company sold the maldon facility for million and recorded a million gain on this transaction 
other restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance for our juarez  mexico facility 
the juarez workforce reductions affected approximately employees 
during fiscal  we also recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance for our kelso  scotland facility

fiscal restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and asset impairment costs of million  related to the decisions to initially convert and then ultimately close our maldon facility and to reduce the workforce in juarez 
for fiscal  these restructuring costs were offset by favorable adjustments in lease obligations of million  as a result of entering into lease termination or sublease agreements for three of our previously closed facilities in the bothell and seattle  washington area  as well as favorable adjustments of million  related to other restructuring accruals 
the details of these fiscal restructuring actions are listed below maldon facility closure we announced the decision to close our maldon facility in july for fiscal  we recorded million for severance and asset impairments related to the closure of the maldon facility

as a result of 
table of contents this planned conversion  we recorded expenses of million for retention costs severance cost for fiscal related to the workforce reduction as part of the maldon facility conversion 
this restructuring affected employees 
other restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance for our juarez facility 
the juarez workforce reductions affected approximately employees 
fiscal restructuring and impairment costs during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs totaling million 
the restructuring and impairment costs were associated with goodwill impairment  the closure of the bothell facility  the write off of the remaining elements of a shop floor data collection system  and other restructuring costs and adjustments to previously recognized restructuring and impairment actions 
goodwill impairment 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at a minimum on an annual basis  for which we selected the third quarter of each fiscal year  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded goodwill impairment of million  of which million represented a partial impairment of goodwill associated with our operations in the u 
k 
our european reportable segment and million represented a full impairment of goodwill associated with our operations in juarez our mexican reportable segment 
the impairment of goodwill associated with operations in the uk arose primarily from a significant medical customer s intention to transfer future production from the uk to a lower cost location 
the impairment also reflected lowered expectations for the uk s electronics manufacturing services industry  in general 
the impairment of goodwill associated with operations in juarez reflected a lowered forecast of near term profits and cash flows associated with operational issues and an anticipated transfer of a major customer s program to another plexus manufacturing facility 
bothell facility closure 
during fiscal  we incurred significant restructuring costs associated with the closure of the bothell facility 
we transferred key customer programs from the bothell facility a part of our united states reportable segment to other plexus locations  primarily in the united states 
this restructuring reduced our capacity by  square feet and affected approximately employees 
we announced our intention to close the bothell facility in fiscal and that action was completed during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred total restructuring and impairment costs associated with the bothell facility closure of approximately million  which consisted of the following elements million for the facility lease  million for employee retention costs and million of other associated costs 
the liability for the facility lease was recognized and measured at fair value for the future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the property 
shop floor data collection system impairment 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment of the remaining elements of a shop floor data collection system 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we extended a maintenance and support agreement for the data collection system through july to provide additional time to evaluate the remaining elements of the system 
based on our evaluation  we determined that the shop floor data collection system was impaired 
we abandoned deployment of these remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system because the anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic reportable segment 
other restructuring costs 
during fiscal  we also recorded the following other restructuring and impairment costs million  which consisted of million associated with a workforce reduction and million of asset impairments at the juarez facility our mexican reportable segment 
the juarez workforce reduction affected approximately employees million for severance associated with the elimination of a corporate executive position 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic reportable segment million for a planned workforce reduction at a facility in maldon 
we originally planned to focus the maldon facility on fulfillment and service and repair 
this transition was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal and result in a workforce reduction of approximately employees 
subsequently  during fiscal it was decided to close the maldon facility and 
table of contents consolidate uk manufacturing in the kelso  scotland facility rather than simply downsize the employment level at maldon million of other restructuring costs 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic reportable segment 
adjustments to provisions during fiscal  we recorded certain adjustments to previously recognized restructuring and impairment costs 
all adjustments to provisions are associated with prior actions in the united states million additional expense related to additional impairment of the closed facility in san diego 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we subleased the remaining part of the san diego facility  which resulted in the additional impairment to adjust the carrying value of the remaining part of the san diego facility to the net present value of future sublease income a million reduction in an accrual for lease exit costs associated with a warehouse located in neenah 
the neenah warehouse was previously abandoned as part of a fiscal restructuring action  however  we reactivated use of the warehouse in the second quarter of fiscal a million reduction in an accrual for lease obligations for one of the closed facilities near seattle 
we subleased one of the two closed seattle facilities held under operating leases 
other income expense 
other income expense for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  october  increase decrease decrease other income expense percent of net sales other income expense for fiscal increased million over fiscal due to increased interest income related to higher average cash balances as well as a higher effective interest rate during fiscal interest expense remained comparable between fiscal years 
miscellaneous income expense fluctuated unfavorably due primarily to foreign currency translation adjustments 
other income expense for fiscal increased million over fiscal due to increased interest income as our average cash balances more than doubled in fiscal over fiscal interest expense remained comparable between fiscal years and miscellaneous income expense fluctuated favorably due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  october  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was because we recorded a tax provision associated with us pre tax income in fiscal whereas no such tax provision was required for the prior fiscal years 
during fiscal  we recorded minimal income tax expense as a result of the establishment in fiscal of a full valuation allowance on us deferred income tax assets see further discussion below and increased income in malaysia and china  which benefit from tax holidays  and reduced pre tax income in the united kingdom 
in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the previously recorded valuation allowance as a credit to income tax 
under sfas no 
 historical and projected financial results along with any other positive or negative evidence should be considered when assessing our ability to generate future taxable income and realize any net deferred income tax assets 
our us operations generated significant pre tax income in fiscal based on our fiscal pre tax income and an assessment of expected future profitability in the us  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits of our cumulative net deferred income tax assets in the us would be utilized in the future 
therefore  we reversed million of the valuation allowance as noted above 
as a result of using the with and without method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  we recorded a valuation allowance against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable 
we had recorded a valuation allowance of million in fiscal against our net operating loss carryforwards as of september  during fiscal  we realized a reduction of our income taxes payable for all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of our state net operating loss carryforwards 
consequently  we reversed approximately million of this valuation allowance with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
as a result  we had a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of september  in addition  there is a remaining valuation allowance of million as of september   related to various state deferred income tax assets for which utilization is uncertain due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in these states 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately percent 
china and mexico have passed new tax laws which are expected to take effect on january  these new laws may result in higher tax rates on our operations in those countries 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily provided by earnings after adjusting for the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization expense  deferred income taxes and stock based compensation expense and increased accounts payable 
these positive cash flow effects were offset  in part  by higher accounts receivable and inventory to support increased customer demand in the first quarter of fiscal our annualized days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for fiscal increased to days from days in fiscal due to slower cash collections in fiscal our inventory turns worsened from turns for fiscal to turns for fiscal inventories increased million from september   primarily as a result of increased customer demand in the first quarter of fiscal and an increase in finished goods to support inventory models such as dof for various customers 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal the primary investments included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment and million of net purchases of short term securities 
fiscal purchases of property  plant and equipment included million  million  million and million related to our asian  us  mexican and european reportable segments  respectively 
we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the principal sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal our actual level of capital expenditures for fiscal will depend on anticipated demand  but we currently expect to spend in the range of million to million 
cash flows provided by financing activities  totaling million for fiscal  primarily represent the income tax benefit of stock option exercises 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility the amended credit facility with our bank group  which allows us to borrow up to million 
the amended credit facility is unsecured and provides lower fees and interest rates than the prior credit facility 
it also can be increased by an 
table of contents additional million  if there is no event of default existing under the amended credit facility agreement and both the company and the administrative agent consent to the increase 
the amended credit facility expires on january  borrowings under the amended credit facility may be either through revolving or swing loans or letters of credit obligations 
as of november   there were no borrowings under the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth  all as defined in the amended credit facility 
interest on borrowings varies depending upon our then current total leverage ratio and begins at a defined base rate  or libor plus percent 
rates would increase upon unfavorable changes in specified financial metrics 
we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused credit commitment which depends on our total leverage ratio  the current fee is percent 
we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and short term investments  the amended credit facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements through fiscal although our net sales growth anticipated for fiscal will increase our working capital needs  we currently do not anticipate having to utilize our amended credit facility to finance this growth 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we anticipate using our earnings to support the future growth of our business 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future 
however  we may in the future consider repurchasing some of our outstanding shares as part of our existing stock buyback program  which was approved by the board of directors 
the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchase of shares would be dependent upon being compliant with the financial covenants existing under the amended credit facility 
these covenants require that there be no event of default existing at the time of  or is caused by  the dividend payment or share repurchase

disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
upon adoption  we transitioned to sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that sfas no 
r is effective and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
prior periods stock based compensation expense is still presented on a pro forma basis 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective october   we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but instead we test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment has occurred 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion of million of goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal we measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the reporting unit s estimated fair market value  which is primarily estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows  although market valuations may also be employed 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or customers and unforeseen reductions in customer demand  future operating performance or industry demand 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less duration  are recognized as costs are incurred utilizing a percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
although our net deferred income tax assets as of september  still reflect a million valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets to offset future taxable income in such states 
we also have a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of september  new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  that provides guidance on how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions which a company has taken or expects to take 
fin is effective no later than fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal although we continue to evaluate the full impact of adopting fin  we are not currently aware of any material impact from adoption on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the effective date for sfas no 
is as of the beginning of fiscal years that start subsequent to november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option permits a company to choose to measure eligible items at specified election dates 
a company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings after adoption 
the effective date for sfas is as of the beginning of fiscal years that start subsequent to november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have used foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
as of september   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs 
table of contents interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we currently do not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our secured credit facility for which we currently have no borrowings 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense in fiscal  and
