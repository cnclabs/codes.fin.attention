this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item general overview arch capital group ltd 
acgl and  together with its subsidiaries  we or us is a bermuda public limited liability company with approximately billion in capital at december  and  through operations in bermuda  the united states  europe and canada  writes insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we focus on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance 
it is our belief that our underwriting platform  our experienced management team and our strong capital base that is unencumbered by significant pre risks have enabled us to establish a strong presence in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive and has traditionally been subject to an underwriting cycle in which a hard market high premium rates  restrictive underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting gains is eventually followed by a soft market low premium rates  relaxed underwriting standards  as well as broader terms and conditions  and underwriting losses 
insurance market conditions may affect  among other things  the demand for our products  our ability to increase premium rates  the terms and conditions of the insurance policies we write  changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy 
the financial results of the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including natural disasters or other catastrophic events  variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in the legal  regulatory and judicial environments  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions 
these factors influence  among other things  the demand for insurance or reinsurance  the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market 
in general  market conditions improved during and in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
this reflected improvement in pricing  terms and conditions following significant industry losses arising from the events of september th  as well as the recognition that intense competition in the late s led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
such industry developments resulted in poor financial results and erosion of the industry s capital base 
consequently  many established insurers and reinsurers reduced their participation in  or exited from  certain markets and  as a result  premium rates escalated in many lines of business 
these developments provided relatively new insurers and reinsurers  like us  with an opportunity to provide needed underwriting capacity 
beginning in late and continuing through  additional capacity emerged in many classes of business and  consequently  premium rate increases have decelerated significantly and  in many classes of business  premium rates have decreased 
however  we believe that we are still able to write insurance and reinsurance business at what we believe to be attractive rates 
in addition  the weather related catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of have resulted in substantial improvements in market conditions in property and certain marine business 
we have increased our writings in these lines of business and  as a result  these lines  which are volatile  will represent a larger proportion of our overall book of business in future periods  which may increase the volatility in our results of operations 
in order to support this expansion  we sold million of non cumulative preferred shares in and signed a quota share reinsurance treaty with flatiron re ltd  a dedicated reinsurance vehicle  which has allowed us to increase our participation in property and marine lines without significantly increasing our probable maximum loss 
the treaty with flatiron re ltd 
provides for a profit commission based on the reported underwriting results on a cumulative basis 
we record such profit commission based on underwriting experience recorded each quarter 
the profit commission arrangement with flatiron re ltd 
may increase the volatility of our reported results of operations on both a quarterly and annual basis 
as a result  our writings in the property and marine lines of business in represented a larger proportion of our overall book of business than in history we commenced operations in september following the completion of the initial public offering of our predecessor  arch capital group us inc us 
us is a delaware company formed in march under the original name of risk capital holdings  inc from that time until may  we provided reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance companies 
on may   we sold our prior reinsurance book of business to folksamerica reinsurance company folksamerica in an asset sale  but retained our surplus and our us licensed reinsurance platform 
on november   following shareholder approval  we changed our legal domicile to bermuda in order to benefit from bermuda s favorable business  regulatory  tax and financing environment 
during the period from may through the announcement of our underwriting initiative in october  we built and acquired insurance businesses that were intended to enable us to generate both fee based revenue eg  commissions and advisory and management fees and risk based revenue ie  insurance premium 
as part of this strategy  we built an underwriting platform that was intended to enable us to maximize risk based revenue during periods in the underwriting cycle when we believed it was more favorable to assume underwriting risk 
in october  we concluded that underwriting conditions favored dedicating our attention exclusively to building our insurance and reinsurance business 
in october  we launched an underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets that included the recruitment of new insurance and reinsurance management teams and an equity capital infusion of million in the form of convertible preference shares 
in april  we completed an offering of common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in september  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of class a warrants by our principal shareholders and certain other investors 
in march  we completed a public offering of common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in may  we completed a public offering of million principal amount of senior notes due may  and received net proceeds of million  of which million of the net proceeds was used to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility 
in  we issued million of non cumulative preferred shares in public offerings and received net proceeds of million 
in the fourth quarter  all remaining outstanding convertible preference shares were converted to common shares 
since the preference shares were treated as common share equivalents in our reported financial results  the conversion had no impact on diluted earnings per share or diluted book value per share 
however  the convertible preference shares were not included in basic calculations prior to their conversion to common shares and  due to the timing of the conversions  basic average shares outstanding and basic earnings per share for only reflect the impact of the preference share conversion for a small portion of the year 
management does not believe that the comparison of basic earnings per share is meaningful for the  or periods presented and such amounts have not been presented or discussed herein 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the issuance of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are driven by the volume and classes of business of the policies and contracts that we write which  in turn  are related to prevailing market conditions 
the premium we charge for the risks assumed is also based on many assumptions 
we price these risks well before our ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 
in addition  our revenues include fee income and income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income investments that are classified as available for sale 
under our basis of accounting  gaap  these investments are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of income 
these unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of shareholders equity in our balance sheet 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses primarily consist of losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition expenses and other operating expenses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses include management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
such costs consist of three components paid losses  changes in estimated amounts for known losses case reserves  and changes in reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for further discussion 
acquisition expenses  net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers  consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
a significant portion of such costs is paid based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary for each class or type of business that we underwrite 
other operating expenses consist primarily of certain company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations 
a large portion of such costs are compensation related and include share based compensation 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  allowance for doubtful accounts  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since limited historical information has been reported to us through december  actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and gaap to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses loss reserves that arise from the business we underwrite 
loss reserves for our insurance and reinsurance operations are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
loss reserves do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial 
at december  and  our loss reserves  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by type and by operating segment were as follows december  us dollars in thousands insurance case reserves 
ibnr reserves total net reserves reinsurance case reserves 
additional case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves total case reserves 
additional case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves insurance operations loss reserves for our insurance operations are comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as ibnr reserves 
for our insurance operations  generally  claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices  the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
our insurance operations also contract with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who  in certain cases  have limited authority to establish case reserves 
the work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel 
loss reserves are also established to provide for loss adjustment expenses lae and represent the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
periodically  adjustments to the reported or case reserves may be made as additional information regarding the claims is reported or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported to an insurer or reinsurer at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid losses and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actuaries estimate ultimate losses and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
ultimate losses and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate losses and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  developed through both industry and company experience  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate losses and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually several months up to a few years 
the claim tail for certain professional liability  executive assurance and healthcare coverages  which are generally written on a claims made basis  is typically longer than property coverages but shorter than casualty lines 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  may be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends  may become known and  as a result  our insurance operations may adjust their reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is recorded in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should loss reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate losses and lae  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate losses and lae  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
at december  and  loss reserves for our insurance operations by major line of business  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  were as follows december  us dollars in thousands casualty programs construction and surety executive assurance professional liability property  marine and aviation 
healthcare other total net reserves the reserving method for our insurance operations to date has been  to a large extent  the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists 
any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors  including the fact that limited historical information has been reported to our insurance operations through december  see below for a discussion of the key assumptions in our insurance operations reserving process 
although loss reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analysis  our insurance operations apply several generally accepted actuarial methods  as discussed below  on a quarterly basis to evaluate their loss reserves  in addition to the expected loss method  in particular for loss reserves from more mature accident years the year in which a loss occurred 
as noted below  beginning in  our insurance operations began to give a relatively small amount of weight to their own experience following reviews of open claims on lines of business written on a claims made basis for which they developed a reasonable level of credible data 
each quarter  as part of the reserving process  actuaries at our insurance operations reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for the projection of liabilities 
if actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information  an adjustment to loss reserves may be supported 
as time passes  estimated loss reserves for a given accident year will be based more on historical loss activity and patterns than on the initial assumptions based on pricing indications 
our insurance operations place more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of loss reserves are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories expected loss methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss and lae ratios are typically developed based upon the information derived by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business  supplemented by industry data available from organizations  such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms  where appropriate 
these ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
expected loss methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses and lae in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available  and is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists for a company 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods may be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses may be less reliable than other methods 
historical paid loss development methods these methods  like historical incurred loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses and necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use incurred losses to estimate ultimate losses  they may be more reliable than the other methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how incurred losses are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
as such  these methods utilize more judgment than historical paid and incurred loss development methods 
bornhuetter ferguson b f paid and incurred loss methods these methods utilize actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses  taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses 
the b f paid and incurred loss methods are useful when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
additional analyses other methodologies are often used in the reserving process for specific types of claims or events  such as catastrophic or other specific major events 
these include vendor catastrophe models  which are typically used in the estimation of loss reserves at the early stage of known catastrophic events before information has been reported to an insurer or reinsurer  and analyses of specific industry events  such as large lawsuits or claims 
in the initial reserving process for casualty business  primarily consisting of primary and excess exposures written on an occurrence basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
the development of our insurance operations casualty business may be unstable due to its long tail nature and the occurrence of high severity events  as a portion of our insurance operations casualty business is in high excess layers 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our insurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for casualty business  including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the policy is entered into  that our insurance operations loss development patterns  which are based on industry loss development patterns and adjusted to reflect differences in our insurance operations mix of business  are reasonable and that our insurance operations claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are assumed to be our best estimate of our exposure to the known claims on those events 
as noted earlier  due to the long claims reporting and settlement period for casualty business  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  our insurance operations may be required to adjust their casualty reserves 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations casualty business for recent accident years have not varied significantly from earlier accident years due to the long tail nature of the business written and the limited number of years of historical experience available for use in projecting loss experience using standard actuarial methods 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases  the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for changes in pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
in the initial reserving process for property  marine and aviation business  which are primarily short tail exposures  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
for catastrophe exposed business  our insurance operations reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models for known events and a heavy reliance on analysis of individual catastrophic events and management judgment 
the development of property losses can be unstable  especially for policies characterized by high severity  low frequency losses 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our insurance operations make a number of key assumptions in their reserving process  including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable  catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and our underwriters judgment as to potential loss exposures can be relied on 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations property business have varied over time due to changes in pricing  reinsurance structure  estimates of catastrophe losses  policy changes such as attachment points  class and limits and geographical distribution 
as a result of the weather related catastrophic events in the second half of and to a lesser extent in  there has been a substantial improvement in rates and market conditions in property lines 
as losses in property lines are reported relatively quickly  expected loss ratios are selected for the current accident year based upon actual attritional loss ratios for earlier accident years  adjusted for rate changes  inflation  changes in reinsurance programs and expected attritional losses based on modeling 
due to the short tail nature of property business  reported loss experience emerges quickly and ultimate losses are known in a reasonably short period of time 
in addition to the assumptions and development characteristics noted above for casualty and property business  our insurance operations authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write program business on their behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities 
this adds additional complexity to the reserving process 
to monitor adherence to the underwriting guidelines given to such parties  our insurance operations periodically perform claims due diligence reviews 
in the initial reserving process for program business  consisting of property and liability exposures which are primarily written on an occurrence basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations program business have varied over time depending on the type of exposures written casualty or property and changes in pricing  loss trends  reinsurance structure and changes in the underlying business 
in the initial reserving process for executive assurance  professional liability and healthcare business  primarily consisting of medium tail exposures written on a claims made basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
beginning in  our insurance operations began to give a relatively small amount of weight to their own experience following reviews of open claims  in particular for lines of business written on a claims made basis for which they developed a reasonable level of credible data 
in general  the expected loss ratios for executive assurance  professional liability and healthcare business for recent accident years have not varied significantly from earlier accident years since this business is primarily written on a claims made basis and is subject to high severity  low frequency losses 
in addition  only a limited number of years of historical experience is available for use in projecting loss experience using standard actuarial methods 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases  the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for the occurrence or lack of large losses  changes in pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
in the initial reserving process for construction and surety business  consisting of primary and excess casualty and contract surety coverages written on an occurrence and claims made basis  our insurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
such business is subject to the assumptions and development characteristics noted above for casualty business 
as time passes  for a given accident year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our insurance operations construction and surety business for recent accident years have not varied significantly from earlier accident years due to the medium tail nature of the business written and the limited number of years of historical experience available for use in actuarial methods 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases  the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios  adjusted for anticipated changes in the regulatory environment  pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
for the years ended december  to  on average  our insurance segment has reported approximately million of estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves  or approximately of average beginning loss reserves 
of such amount  approximately million came from long tail lines  or of average beginning loss reserves  and million from medium tail lines  or of beginning loss reserves  offset partially by adverse development on million from short tail lines  or of average beginning loss reserves 
the average adverse development on short tail lines resulted from million of adverse development recorded in on the catastrophic events 
for the year ended december   estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves was million  or of beginning loss reserves 
such amount consisted of approximately million from long tail lines  or of beginning loss reserves  and million from medium tail lines  or of beginning loss reserves  partially offset by adverse development of million from short tail lines which included million of adverse development on the catastrophic events  or of beginning loss reserves 
for informational purposes  based on historical results  applying the average estimated net favorable development in average beginning loss reserves for the years ended december  to to our insurance segment s net loss reserves of billion at december  would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share  and applying the of estimated net favorable development in beginning loss reserves for the year ended december  to such loss reserves would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share 
the amounts noted above are informational only and should not be considered projections of future events 
future favorable or adverse development in our insurance segment s loss reserves is subject to numerous factors  and no assurances can be given that we will experience favorable development in our loss reserves or that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the amounts shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
because of our insurance segment s limited operating history  the sensitivity analysis above is one way to gauge the impact of changes in the assumptions in our reserving process 
for another estimate of potential variability in our insurance segment s loss reserves  see simulation results 
refer to results of operations for a discussion on net favorable or adverse development of our insurance operations prior year loss reserves 
reinsurance operations loss reserves for our reinsurance operations are comprised of case reserves for claims reported  additional case reserves acrs and ibnr reserves 
our reinsurance operations receive reports of claims notices from ceding companies and record case reserves based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company 
case reserves on known events may be supplemented by acrs  which are often estimated by our reinsurance operations claims personnel ahead of official notification from the ceding company  or when our reinsurance operations judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company 
in certain instances  our reinsurance operations establish acrs even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event 
in addition  specific claim information reported by ceding companies or obtained through claim audits can alert our reinsurance operations to emerging trends such as changing legal interpretations of coverage and liability  claims from unexpected sources or classes of business  and significant changes in the frequency or severity of individual claims 
such information is often used in the process of estimating ibnr reserves 
the estimation of loss reserves for our reinsurance operations is subject to the same risk factors as the estimation of loss reserves for our insurance operations 
in addition  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for reinsurers  due primarily to the claim tail for reinsurers is generally longer because claims are first reported to the ceding company and then to the reinsurer through one or more intermediaries  the reliance on premium estimates  where reports have not been received from the ceding company  in the reserving process  the potential for writing a number of reinsurance contracts with different ceding companies with the same exposure to a single loss event  the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and the differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
as with our insurance operations  the process of estimating loss reserves for our reinsurance operations involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
as discussed above  such uncertainty is greater for reinsurers compared to insurers 
as a result  our reinsurance operations obtain information from numerous sources to assist in the process 
pricing actuaries from our reinsurance operations devote considerable effort to understanding and analyzing a ceding company s operations and loss history during the underwriting of the business  using a combination of ceding company and industry statistics 
such statistics normally include historical premium and loss data by class of business  individual claim information for larger claims  distributions of insurance limits provided  loss reporting and payment patterns  and rate change history 
this analysis is used to project expected loss ratios for each treaty during the upcoming contract period 
as mentioned above  there can be a considerable time lag from the time a claim is reported to a ceding company to the time it is reported to the reinsurer 
the lag can be several years in some cases and may be attributed to a number of reasons  including the time it takes to investigate a claim  delays associated with the litigation process  the deterioration in a claimant s physical condition many years after an accident occurs  the case reserving approach of the ceding company  etc 
in the reserving process  our reinsurance operations assume that such lags are predictable  on average  over time and therefore the lags are contemplated in the loss reporting patterns used in their actuarial methods 
this means that our reinsurance operations must rely on estimates for a longer period of time than does an insurance company 
backlogs in the recording of assumed reinsurance can also complicate the accuracy of loss reserve estimation 
as of december   there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information at our reinsurance operations 
our reinsurance operations rely heavily on information reported by ceding companies  as discussed above 
in order to determine the accuracy and completeness of such information  underwriters  actuaries  and claims personnel at our reinsurance operations often perform audits of ceding companies and regularly review information received from ceding companies for unusual or unexpected results 
material findings are usually discussed with the ceding companies 
our reinsurance operations sometime encounter situations where it determines that a claim presentation from a ceding company is not in accordance with contract terms 
in these situations  our reinsurance operations attempt to resolve the dispute with the ceding company 
most situations are resolved amicably and without the need for litigation or arbitration 
however  in the infrequent situations where a resolution is not possible  our reinsurance operations will vigorously defend their position in such disputes 
at december  and  loss reserves for our reinsurance operations by major line of business  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  were as follows december  us dollars in thousands casualty property excluding property catastrophe other specialty 
marine and aviation property catastrophe other total net reserves the reserving method for our reinsurance operations to date has been  to a large extent  the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists

in the initial reserving process for medium tail and long tail lines  consisting of casualty  other specialty  marine and aviation and other exposures  our reinsurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
the development of medium tail and long tail business may be unstable  especially if there are high severity major events  with business written on an excess of loss basis typically having a longer tail than business written on a pro rata basis 
as time passes  for a given underwriting year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our reinsurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for medium tail and long tail lines  including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the contract is entered into  historical paid and reported development patterns are stable and our reinsurance operations claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are assumed to be our best estimate of our exposure to the known claims on those events 
the expected loss ratios used in our reinsurance operations initial reserving process for medium tail and long tail contracts have varied over time due to changes in pricing  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
as the credibility of historical experience for earlier underwriting years increases  the experience from these underwriting years will be used in the actuarial analysis to determine future underwriting year expected loss ratios  adjusted for changes in pricing  loss trends  terms and conditions and reinsurance structure 
the process of estimating loss reserves for our reinsurance operations involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for reinsurers than for insurers due to the longer claim tail for reinsurers  the reliance on premium estimates in the reserving process  the diversity and instability of loss development patterns  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and the differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  as a result of the start up nature of our reinsurance operations in and  the assumptions used in the initial loss estimates were subject to greater uncertainty than for an established company  especially for casualty reinsurance exposures which have a longer claim tail and involve a higher degree of judgment by management than short tail lines 
in the reserving process in and  our reinsurance operations recognized that there is a possibility that the assumptions made could prove to be inaccurate due to the factors discussed above related to the start up nature of their operations in both periods 
in response to such factors  and their impact on the credibility of the initial loss estimates for casualty reinsurance exposures  a provision was included in establishing our reinsurance operations net loss reserves in and on casualty losses occurring prior to each balance sheet date 
as of december   the provision  included in ibnr  was million or of our reinsurance operations net loss reserves 
due to the additional data our reinsurance operations had gained on its existing book of business by the end of  it was determined that it was no longer necessary to continue to include a provision in the reserving process beginning in based on the recommendation of an independent actuarial firm  our reinsurance operations adopted a methodology to evaluate the existing provision by comparing actual claims experience to a schedule of expected claims experience prepared by the independent actuarial firm 
if the actual claims experience is in line with the expected claims experience  a reduction of the provision is made based on the schedule established in the review 
for the years ended december   and  following reviews of actual and expected claims experience  our reinsurance operations reduced the provision by million  million and million  respectively 
at december   the remaining provision included in our reinsurance operations loss reserves was million or of our reinsurance operations net loss reserves  compared to million or of our reinsurance operations net loss reserves at december  in the initial reserving process for short tail lines  consisting of property excluding property catastrophe and property catastrophe exposures  our reinsurance operations primarily rely on the expected loss method 
for known catastrophic events  our reinsurance operations reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models and a heavy reliance on analysis which includes ceding company inquiries and management judgment 
the development of property losses may be unstable  especially where there is high catastrophic exposure  may be characterized by high severity  low frequency losses for excess and catastrophe exposed business and may be highly correlated across contracts 
as time passes  for a given underwriting year  additional weight is given to the paid and incurred b f loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process 
our reinsurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for short tail lines  including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable  catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and our underwriters judgment and guidance received from ceding companies as to potential loss exposures may be relied on 
the expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for our reinsurance operations property exposures have varied over time due to changes in pricing  reinsurance structure  estimates of catastrophe losses  terms and conditions and geographical distribution 
as losses in property lines are reported relatively quickly  expected loss ratios are selected for the current underwriting year incorporating the experience for earlier underwriting years  adjusted for rate changes  inflation  changes in reinsurance programs  expectations about present and future market conditions and expected attritional losses based on modeling 
due to the short tail nature of property business  reported loss experience emerges quickly and ultimate losses are known in a reasonably short period of time 
for the years ended december  to  on average  our reinsurance segment has reported approximately million of estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves  or of average beginning loss reserves 
of such amount  approximately million came from short tail lines  or of average beginning loss reserves  and million came from medium tail and long tail lines  or of average beginning loss reserves 
for the year ended december   estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves was million  or of beginning loss reserves 
of such amount  approximately million came from short tail lines  or of beginning loss reserves  and million came from medium tail and long tail lines  or of beginning loss reserves 
the million of estimated net favorable development during reflected approximately million of adverse development on the catastrophic events  primarily in short tail lines 
for informational purposes  based on our reinsurance segment s historical results  applying the average estimated net favorable development in average beginning loss reserves for the years ended december  to to our reinsurance segment s net loss reserves of billion at december  would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share  while using the of estimated net favorable development in beginning loss reserves for the year ended december  to such loss reserves would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share 
the amounts noted above are informational only and should not be considered projections of future events 
future favorable or adverse development in our reinsurance segment s loss reserves is subject to numerous factors  and no assurances can be given that we will experience favorable development in our loss reserves or that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the amounts shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
because of our reinsurance segment s limited operating history  the sensitivity analysis above is one way to gauge the impact of changes in the assumptions in our reserving process 
for another estimate of potential variability in our reinsurance segment s loss reserves  see simulation results 
refer to results of operations for additional discussion on net favorable or adverse development of our reinsurance operations prior year loss reserves 
simulation results generally  due to the insufficient amount of historical loss data for our insurance and reinsurance operations in many lines of business  we do not produce a range of estimates in calculating reserves 
as described above  we primarily use the expected loss method to calculate our initial loss reserves  and such amounts represent management s best estimate of our ultimate liabilities 
as the loss data has developed  other actuarial methods have been given more weight in our reserving process for certain lines of business 
in order to illustrate the potential volatility in our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we used a statistical model to simulate a range of results based on various probabilities 
both the probabilities and related modeling are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the simulation relies on a significant number of assumptions  such as the potential for multiple entities to react similarly to external events  and includes other statistical assumptions 
our recorded estimate of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by operating segment at december   along with the results of the simulation are as follows december  insurance reinsurance total us dollars in thousands total net reserves simulation results th percentile th percentile simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will not exceed the indicated amount 
simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will be at or below the indicated amount 
the simulation results shown for each segment do not add to the total simulation results  as the individual segment simulation results do not reflect the diversification effects across our segments 
for informational purposes  based on the total simulation results  a change in our loss reserves to the amount indicated at the th percentile would result in a decrease in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share  while a change in our loss reserves to the amount indicated at the th percentile would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately million  or per diluted share 
the simulation results noted above are informational only  and no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the simulation results shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
we do not have significant exposure to pre liabilities  such as asbestos related illnesses and other long tail liabilities and  to date  we have experienced a relatively low level of reported claims activity in many lines of business  particularly in longer tailed lines such as primary and excess casualty and executive assurance  which have longer time periods during which claims are reported and paid 
our limited history does not provide meaningful trend information for such lines of business 
ceded reinsurance in the normal course of business  our insurance operations cede a substantial portion of their premium through pro rata  excess of loss and facultative reinsurance agreements 
our reinsurance operations also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify it for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by our reinsurance operations 
such arrangements  where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer  are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  our reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties 
such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties  including the reinsurers  such as our reinsurance operations  and the ceding company 
reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets  predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
if the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements  our insurance or reinsurance operations would be liable for such defaulted amounts 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
although we believe that our insurance and reinsurance operations have been successful in obtaining reinsurance and retrocessional protection since the commencement of our underwriting initiative in october  it is not certain that they will be able to continue to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  our insurance and reinsurance operations may not be able successfully to mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements and may lead to increased volatility in our results of operations in future periods 
see risk factors risks relating to our industry the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the use of individual per risk and inuring reinsurance contracts to limit exposure  our insurance operations had in force during a catastrophe reinsurance program which provides coverage for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during the contract period equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence of such losses 
estimated losses related to hurricane katrina and hurricane wilma have exceeded the per occurrence retention 
based on current estimates  our insurance operations has recorded recoverables of approximately million through such coverage for hurricane katrina and million for hurricane wilma with approximately million of remaining available coverage for hurricane katrina and million of remaining available coverage for hurricane wilma should the actual amount of losses ultimately attributable to such events exceed current estimates 
amounts shown for hurricane katrina are net of reinstatement premiums 
estimates for our insurance operations related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and other catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of are based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques  industry assessments of exposure  claims information obtained from its clients and brokers to date and a review of its in force contracts 
actual losses from these events may vary materially from the insurance operations estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors  including the preliminary nature of available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the contingent nature of business interruption exposures  the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity and attendant coverage issues 
in addition  actual losses may increase if reinsurers dispute or fail to meet their obligations to our insurance operations or the reinsurance protections purchased by our insurance operations are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable 
our insurance operations had in effect during a reinsurance program which provided coverage equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during in the first quarter  our insurance operations renewed its reinsurance program which provides coverage for certain property catastrophe related losses occurring during equal to a maximum of of the first million in excess of a million retention per occurrence 
the cost of the coverage in was higher than in on december   arch re bermuda entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty with flatiron re ltd  a newly formed bermuda reinsurance company  pursuant to which flatiron re ltd 
is assuming a quota share the flatiron treaty of certain lines of property and marine business underwritten by arch re bermuda for unaffiliated third parties for the and underwriting years january  to december  
the quota share is subject to decrease by arch re bermuda under certain circumstances 
in addition  in certain circumstances  flatiron re ltd 
may extend at its option the coverage provided by the flatiron treaty to arch re bermuda s underwriting year 
effective june   the parties amended the flatiron treaty to increase the percentage ceded to flatiron re ltd 
from to of all covered business bound by arch re bermuda from and including june  until and including august  provided such business does not incept beyond september  the ceding percentage for all business bound outside of this period will continue to be  subject to adjustment as provided under the flatiron treaty 
arch re bermuda pays to flatiron re ltd 
a reinsurance premium in the amount of the ceded percentage of the original gross written premium on the business reinsured with flatiron re ltd 
less a ceding commission  which includes a reimbursement of direct acquisition expenses as well as a commission to arch re bermuda for generating the business 
the flatiron treaty also provides for a profit commission to arch re bermuda based on the underwriting results for the and underwriting years on a cumulative basis 
arch re bermuda records such profit commission based on underwriting experience recorded each quarter 
as a result  the profit commission arrangement with flatiron re ltd 
may increase the volatility of our reported results of operations on both a quarterly and annual basis 
our reinsurance operations previously purchased a catastrophe reinsurance program which provides up to million of coverage in excess of certain deductibles for any one occurrence and million in the aggregate annually  for certain catastrophe related losses worldwide occurring during the period from may through april based on current estimates  our reinsurance operations have recorded recoverables of approximately million  net of reinstatement premiums  related to the catastrophic events 
the recovery represents full usage of the available coverage under the reinsurance program  and the coverage was not renewed upon expiration 
estimates for our reinsurance operations related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and other catastrophic events that occurred in the second half of are based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques  industry assessments of exposure  claims information obtained from its clients and brokers to date and a review of its in force contracts 
actual losses from these events may vary materially from our reinsurance operations estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors  including the preliminary nature of available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the contingent nature of business interruption exposures  the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity and attendant coverage issues 
in addition  actual losses may increase if reinsurers dispute or fail to meet their obligations to our reinsurance operations or the reinsurance protections purchased by our reinsurance operations are otherwise unavailable 
while our reinsurance operations purchase industry loss warranty contracts and other reinsurance which is intended to limit their exposure  the non renewal of the catastrophe reinsurance program increases the risk retention of our reinsurance operations and  as a result  may increase the volatility in our results of operations in future periods 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products  usually twelve months 
premiums written include estimates in most of our insurance operations lines of business 
the amount of such insurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and other assets at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business  similar business and available industry information 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in force insurance policies 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received or in cases where the amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies are adjusted to reflect management s best judgments and expectations 
premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include our underwriters  the historical experience of the underlying business  similar business and available industry information 
premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the inception date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  generally  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
reinstatement premiums for our insurance and reinsurance operations are recognized at the time a loss event occurs  where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms 
reinstatement premiums  if obligatory  are fully earned when recognized 
the accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on an estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses  which reflects management s judgment  as described above in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the amount of reinsurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and the amount of related acquisition expenses by type of business were as follows at december  and december  gross amount acquisition expenses net amount gross amount acquisition expenses net amount us dollars in thousands casualty property excluding property catastrophe other specialty marine and aviation property catastrophe other total premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly 
such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
based on currently available information  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance premiums assumed  irrespective of the class of business  are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts 
contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy  which is typically months 
accordingly  the premium is earned evenly over the term 
contracts which are written on a risks attaching basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts 
premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract  typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a month period 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses  are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts 
we also write certain business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance 
under these contracts  we assume a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for an anticipated margin  which is typically lower than on traditional reinsurance contracts 
the terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience  loss corridors  sublimits and caps 
examples of such business include aggregate stop loss coverages  financial quota share coverages and multi year retrospectively rated excess of loss coverages 
if these contracts are deemed to transfer risk  they are accounted for as reinsurance 
certain assumed reinsurance contracts  which pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  are deemed not to transfer insurance risk  are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in statement of position sop  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk 
however  it is possible that we could incur financial losses on such contracts 
management exercises significant judgment in the assumptions used in determining whether assumed contracts should be accounted for as reinsurance contracts under sfas no 
or deposit insurance contracts under sop under sop  for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in our underwriting results 
when the estimated profit margin is explicit  the margin is reflected as fee income and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses 
when the estimated profit margin is implicit  the margin is reflected as an offset to paid losses and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses 
for those contracts that do not transfer an element of underwriting risk  the projected profit is reflected in earnings over the estimated settlement period using the interest method and such profit is included in investment income 
additional judgments are required when applying the accounting guidance set forth in sop with respect to the revenue recognition criteria for contracts deemed not to transfer insurance risk 
retroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured 
in certain instances  reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and  accordingly  we bifurcate the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and account for each element separately 
underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately 
subsequent changes in estimated or actual cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction  with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
acquisition expenses and other expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business in our underwriting operations are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
acquisition expenses  net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers  consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
other operating expenses also include expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business 
deferred acquisition costs  which are based on the related unearned premiums  are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience  and anticipated investment income 
collection of insurance related balances and provision for doubtful accounts for purposes of managing risk  we reinsure a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write  and we may also use retrocessional protection 
ceded premiums written represented approximately of gross premiums written for  compared to for and for the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
although we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have been successful in obtaining reinsurance protection since the commencement of our underwriting initiative in october  it is not certain that we will be able to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  we may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
further  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and retrocessionaires because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
we are also subject to risks based upon the possibility that loss payments could occur earlier than the receipt of related reinsurance recoverables 
our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses not including prepaid reinsurance premiums of billion and billion  respectively  were due from carriers which had an am best rating of a or better

is required to contribute funds into a trust for the benefit of arch re bermuda 
the recoverable from flatiron re ltd 
was fully collateralized through such trust at december  see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for further details on the flatiron treaty 
in connection with our acquisition of arch specialty in february  the seller  sentry  agreed to reinsure and guarantee all liabilities arising out of arch specialty s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
in addition to the guarantee provided by sentry  substantially all of the recoverable from sentry is still subject to the original reinsurance agreements inuring to arch specialty and  to the extent sentry fails to comply with its payment obligations to us  we may seek reimbursement from the third party reinsurers under such agreements 
the following table provides a breakdown of the all other category by am best rating companies rated a or better companies rated b companies not rated total a substantial portion of such amount is collateralized through reinsurance trusts or letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties  as appropriate 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of all the reinsurers to which we cede business 
if our analysis indicates that there is significant uncertainty regarding the collectibility of amounts due from reinsurers  managing general agents  brokers and other clients  we will record a provision for doubtful accounts 
at december   approximately of premiums receivable of million represented amounts not yet due  while amounts in excess of days overdue were of the total 
at december   approximately of premiums receivable of million represented amounts not yet due  while amounts in excess of days overdue were of the total 
approximately of the million of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable were in excess of days overdue at december   compared to of the million of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable at december  at december  and  our reserves for doubtful accounts were approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in reserves for doubtful accounts at december  was due to the higher level of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable in excess of days overdue at december  we are also subject to credit risk from our alternative market products  such as rent a captive risk sharing programs  which allow a client to retain a significant portion of its loss exposure without the administrative costs and capital commitment required to establish and operate its own captive 
in certain of these programs  we participate in the operating results by providing excess reinsurance coverage and earn commissions and management fees 
in addition  we write program business on a risk sharing basis with managing general agents or brokers  which may be structured with commissions which are contingent on the underwriting results of the program 
while we attempt to obtain collateral from such parties in an amount sufficient to guarantee their projected financial obligations to us  there is no guarantee that such collateral will be sufficient to secure their actual ultimate obligations 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred income tax asset may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  if we subsequently assess that the valuation allowance is no longer needed  a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination is made 
investments we currently classify all of our fixed maturity investments  short term investments and other investments as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities is generally determined from quotations received from a nationally recognized pricing service 
short term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue 
short term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of our investment portfolios under the management of external and internal investment managers 
other investments are carried at estimated fair value 
fair value is initially considered to be equal to the cost of such investment until the investment is revalued based on substantive events or other factors which could indicate a diminution or appreciation in value 
other investments are classified as available for sale and include alternative investments  which are funds with underlying ownership structures that may be limited partnerships lps or limited liability companies llcs  equity securities such as investments in mutual funds and privately held securities 
for those investments in which the underlying ownership structure is an lp or an llc ie  when the llc meets specific criteria requiring it to be treated similar to an lp we use the equity method to account for such investments 
under the equity method  investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for changes in our proportionate share of net income or loss or other changes in capital of the investee 
changes in the carrying value of such investments are recorded in net investment income or other income 
investments in equity securities are carried at estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
the estimated fair value of investments in privately held securities  other than those carried under the equity method  is initially equal to the cost of such investments until the investments are revalued based principally on substantive events or other factors which could indicate a diminution or appreciation in value  such as an arm s length third party transaction justifying an increased valuation or adverse development of a significant nature requiring a write down

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fasb staff position nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities  we review our investments each quarter to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline and iv our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
where our analysis of the above factors results in the conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the securities is written down to fair value and is reflected as a realized loss 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment on fixed maturities  we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the other than temporary impairment and the provision for other than temporary impairment reflected as a discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is amortized into net investment income over the remaining life of the fixed maturities  or until such securities are sold 
in general  we consider twelve months to be the threshold for the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value in order to consider such security s value to be other than temporarily impaired 
securities which are in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months are considered other than temporarily impaired  while securities in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months are evaluated for other than temporary impairment if such unrealized loss is in excess of of the security s cost basis 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary because we concluded that the investment was impaired for a minor length of time or to a minor extent and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
such sale would not contradict our determination that the decline was temporary because subsequent decisions to sell a security are made within the context of overall risk management  new information and the assessment of such security s value relative to comparable securities 
while our internal and external investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe the preferred course of action is to hold securities until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision by us to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon a change in market and other factors discussed above 
we believe these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended on january   all derivative financial instruments  including embedded derivative instruments  are required to be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of a derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and whether the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the asset or liability hedged 
our investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments 
we utilize various derivative instruments such as futures contracts as part of the management of our stock index fund investments and to replicate equity investment positions 
derivative instruments may be used to enhance investment performance  replicate investment positions or manage market exposures and duration risk that would be allowed under our investment guidelines if implemented in other ways

no value is attributed to awards that employees forfeit because they fail to satisfy vesting conditions 
as such  the number of shares granted is reduced by assumed forfeitures and adjusted based on actual forfeitures until vesting 
such expense is amortized over the requisite service period of the related awards 
the share based compensation expense associated with awards that have graded vesting features and vest based on service conditions only i granted after the effective date of adoption is calculated on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the related awards and ii granted prior to the effective date of adoption and that remain unvested as of the date of adoption is calculated on a graded vesting basis as prescribed under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  over the remaining requisite service periods of the related awards 
under the modified prospective method of transition  compensation expense is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption for all share based payments i granted after the effective date of adoption and ii granted prior to the effective date of adoption and that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
under the modified prospective method of transition  we are not required to restate our prior period financial statements to reflect expensing of share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
therefore  the results for the year ended december  are not comparable to results for the and periods 
under sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based option awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and requires judgment in determining key data inputs including estimating the risk free interest rate  expected life of the option and expected volatility rate 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
in our process for estimating the fair value of stock options granted  we believe that we have made a good faith fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r as well as guidance from the sec as contained in staff accounting bulletin no 
in a way that is designed to take into account the assumptions that underlie the instrument s value that marketplace participants would reasonably make 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

see note  income taxes  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average statutory tax rate for and liquidity and capital resources acgl is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries 
generally  acgl depends on its available cash resources  liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments  including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to the series a non cumulative and series b non cumulative preferred shares and common shares 
for the years ended december   and  acgl received dividends of million  million and million from arch re bermuda 
such amounts were used to pay interest on acgl s senior notes 
on a consolidated basis  our aggregate cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december  and  our fixed income portfolio  which includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments  had an average standard poor s quality rating of aaa and aa  respectively  and an average effective duration of years and years  respectively 
acgl s readily available cash  short term investments and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards 
under bermuda law  arch reinsurance ltd 
arch re bermuda is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin ie  the amount by which the value of its general business assets must exceed its general business liabilities equal to the greatest of million  of net premiums written being gross premiums written by us less any premiums ceded by us  but we may not deduct more than of gross premiums when computing net premiums written and of loss and other insurance reserves 
arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in compliance with its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files  at least seven days before payment of such dividends  with the bermuda monetary authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited  without prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority  from reducing by or more its total statutory capital  as set out in its previous year s statutory financial statements 
at december   as determined under bermuda law  arch re bermuda had statutory capital of billion and statutory capital and surplus of billion 
such amounts include ownership interests in us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
accordingly  arch re bermuda can pay approximately million to acgl during without providing an affidavit to the bermuda monetary authority  as discussed above 
our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries can pay approximately million in dividends or distributions to arch us  our arch us holding company  which is owned by arch re bermuda  during without prior regulatory approval 
such dividends or distributions may be subject to applicable withholding or other taxes 
arch europe can pay approximately million  or million  in dividends to acgl during without prior notice and approval by the fsa 
in addition  the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is also constrained by our dependence on the financial strength ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries from independent rating agencies 
the ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
we believe that acgl has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain assets on deposit  which primarily consist of fixed maturities  with various regulatory authorities to support their operations 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third parties 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  arch re bermuda maintains assets in trust accounts as collateral for insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated companies 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and billion  respectively 
acgl  through its subsidiaries  provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  through certain reinsurance arrangements essential to the ratings of such subsidiaries 
except as described in the preceding sentence  or where express reinsurance  guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place  each of acgl s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments and no other acgl subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible 
any reinsurance arrangements  guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the acgl subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties creditors or insureds of such entity are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements 
our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time losses are paid 
the period of time from the occurrence of a claim through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations  financing arrangements or routine sales of investments 
as part of our investment strategy  we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short term and intermediate term securities which  combined with expected cash flow  is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations 
however  due to the nature of our operations  cash flows are affected by claim payments that may comprise large payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate from year to year 
we believe that our liquid investments and cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claim payment obligations 
however  the timing and amounts of actual claim payments related to recorded loss reserves vary based on many factors  including large individual losses  changes in the legal environment  as well as general market conditions 
the ultimate amount of the claim payments could differ materially from our estimated amounts 
certain lines of business written by us  such as excess casualty  have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity 
the foregoing may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns 
the impact of this variability can be exacerbated by the fact that the timing of the receipt of reinsurance recoverables owed to us may be slower than anticipated by us 
therefore  the irregular timing of claim payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods and may require us to utilize other sources of liquidity to make these payments  which may include the sale of investments or utilization of existing or new credit facilities or capital market transactions 
if the source of liquidity is the sale of investments  we may be forced to sell such investments at a loss  which may be material 
consolidated cash provided by operating activities was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  payments related to the and catastrophic events reduced operating cash flows by million for the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income and collected reinsurance recoverables  offset by losses and loss adjustment expense payments  reinsurance premiums paid  operating costs and current taxes paid 
we expect that our operational needs  including our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs  for the next twelve months  at a minimum  will be met by our balance of cash  short term investments and our credit facilities  as well as by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations for an analysis of our contractual commitments at december  we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and will seek to adjust our capital base up or down according to the needs of our business 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete  sufficient capital to enable our underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the us and other key markets  and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary for our non us operating companies because they are non admitted under us state insurance regulations 
as part of our capital management program  we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or other methods or a combination of such methods 
any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements and other factors  including legal restrictions  rating agency requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
on february   our board of directors authorized us to invest up to billion in acgl s common shares through a share repurchase program 
repurchases under the program may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through february the timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
in connection with the repurchase program  the warburg pincus funds and hellman friedman funds waived their rights relating to share repurchases under the shareholders agreement for all repurchases of common shares by acgl under the repurchase program in open market transactions and certain privately negotiated transactions 
see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividends 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries  which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could  among other things  affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit 
in addition to common share capital  we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares  common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and or letters of credit 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
in june  acgl and arch us filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
this registration statement allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares  common shares  warrants  share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares 
the shelf registration statement enables us to efficiently access the public debt and or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs 
the shelf registration statement also allows selling shareholders to resell common shares that they own in one or more offerings from time to time 
we will not receive any proceeds from any shares offered by the selling shareholders 
this report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
in august  we entered into a five year agreement for a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a billion secured letter of credit facility 
the million unsecured loan and letter of credit facility is also available for the issuance of unsecured letters of credit up to million for our us based reinsurance operation 
during  acgl completed two public offerings of non cumulative preferred shares 
on february   million principal amount of series a non cumulative preferred shares series a preferred shares were issued with net proceeds of million and  on may   million principal amount of series b non cumulative preferred shares series b preferred shares and together with the series a preferred shares  the preferred shares were issued with net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of the offerings were used to support the underwriting activities of acgl s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
acgl has the right to redeem all or a portion of each series of preferred shares at a redemption price of per share on or after february  for the series a preferred shares and may  for the series b preferred shares 
dividends on the preferred shares are non cumulative 
consequently  in the event dividends are not declared on the preferred shares for any dividend period  holders of preferred shares will not be entitled to receive a dividend for such period  and such undeclared dividend will not accrue and will not be payable 
holders of preferred shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when  as and if declared by acgl s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board of directors 
any such dividends will be payable from the date of original issue on a non cumulative basis  quarterly in arrears 
to the extent declared  these dividends will accumulate  with respect to each dividend period  in an amount per share equal to of the liquidation preference per annum for the series a preferred shares and of the liquidation preference per annum for the series b preferred shares 
for the year ended december   we paid million to holders of the preferred shares and  at december   had declared an aggregate of million of dividends to be paid to holders of the preferred shares 
at december   acgl s capital of billion consisted of million of senior notes  representing of the total  million of preferred shares  representing of the total  and common shareholders equity of billion  representing the balance 
at december   acgl s capital of billion consisted of senior notes of million  representing of the total  and common shareholders equity of billion  representing the balance 
the increase in capital during of billion was primarily attributable to net income for the year ended december   the issuance of million of preferred shares and an after tax increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio during which was primarily due to a decrease in the level of interest rates in the second half of natural and man made catastrophic events we have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
catastrophes can also cause losses in non property business such as workers compensation or general liability 
in addition to the nature of property business  we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property  including inflation  property value appreciation and geographic concentration  tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
it is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and  to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  claims for natural and man made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  we may not be successful in doing so 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events 
in our insurance operations  we seek to limit our exposure through the purchase of reinsurance 
we cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
there can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  will be enforceable in the manner we intend 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
for our natural catastrophe exposed business  we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses in any geographic zone 
we monitor our exposure to catastrophic events  including earthquake and wind and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures 
our estimated probable maximum pre tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques  but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures 
we seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events 
currently  we generally seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to approximately of total shareholders equity for a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone that could be expected to occur once in every years  although we reserve the right to change this threshold at any time 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of our total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders equity exposed to a single catastrophic event 
in addition  depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio  we may seek to adjust our self imposed limitations on probable maximum pre tax loss for catastrophe exposed business

contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit and revolving credit facilities on august   we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement for a million unsecured revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a billion secured letter of credit facility  an increase of million from the previous credit agreement 
the million unsecured revolving loan is also available for the issuance of unsecured letters of credit up to million for arch re us borrowings of revolving loans may be made by acgl and arch re us at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative base rate at our option 
secured letters of credit are available for issuance on behalf of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to our compliance with certain covenants and conditions  including absence of a material adverse change 
these covenants require  among other things  that we maintain a debt to shareholders equity ratio of not greater than to and shareholders equity in excess of billion plus of future aggregate net income for each quarterly period not including any future net losses beginning after june  and of future aggregate proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity and that our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain at least a b rating from am best 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries which are party to the credit agreement are required to maintain minimum shareholders equity levels 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement at december  the credit agreement expires on august  including the secured letter of credit portion of the credit agreement and another letter of credit facility together  the loc facilities  we have access to letter of credit facilities for up to a total of billion 
the principal purpose of the loc facilities is to issue  as required  evergreen standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements to ensure that such counterparties are permitted to take credit for reinsurance obtained from our reinsurance subsidiaries in united states jurisdictions where such subsidiaries are not licensed or otherwise admitted as an insurer  as required under insurance regulations in the united states  and to comply with requirements of lloyd s of london in connection with qualifying quota share and other arrangements 
the amount of letters of credit issued is driven by  among other things  the timing and payment of catastrophe losses  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the further expansion of our business and the loss experience of such business 
when issued  certain letters of credit are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the loc facilities also require the maintenance of certain covenants  which we were in compliance with at december  at such date  we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit under the loc facilities  which were secured by investments totaling million 
the other letter of credit facility was amended and restated in december it is anticipated that the loc facilities will be renewed or replaced on expiry  but such renewal or replacement will be subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
in addition to letters of credit  we have established and may establish additional insurance trust accounts in the us and canada to secure our reinsurance amounts payable as required

at december   approximately billion  or  of our total investments and cash was internally managed  compared to billion  or  at december  while maintaining our emphasis on preservation of capital and liquidity  we expect our portfolio to become more diversified and  as a result  we may expand into areas which are not currently part of our investment strategy 
we participate in a securities lending program under which certain of our fixed income portfolio securities are loaned to third parties  primarily major brokerage firms  for short periods of time through a lending agent 
such securities have been reclassified as fixed maturities and short term investments pledged under securities lending agreements  at fair value 
we maintain control over the securities we lend  retain the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receive a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities 
collateral received  primarily in the form of cash  is required at a rate of of the fair value of the loaned securities or of the fair value of the loaned securities when the collateral and loaned securities are denominated in non us currencies including accrued investment income and is monitored and maintained by the lending agent

as part of our investment strategy  we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short term and intermediate term securities which  combined with expected cash flow  is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations 
our investment strategy allows for the use of derivative securities 
derivative instruments may be used to enhance investment performance  replicate investment positions or manage market exposures and duration risk that would be allowed under our investment guidelines if implemented in other ways 
we began using equity futures to replicate equity investment positions in the first quarter 
the fair values of those derivatives are based on quoted market prices 
the notional value of the net long position for equity futures was million at december  in connection with the use of equity futures  we also began using exchange traded treasury note futures in the first quarter

in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of december  market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and consists of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our investments and cash 
investment market risk fixed income securities 
we invest in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
we consider the effect of interest rate movements on the market value of our fixed maturities  fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements  short term investments and certain of our other investments which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities falls  and the converse is also true 
the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on the portfolio at december  and based on historical observations  there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time and  accordingly  the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth below

interest rate shift in basis points us dollars in millions december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is value at risk var 
var attempts to take into account a broad cross section of risks facing a portfolio by utilizing relevant securities volatility data skewed towards the most recent months and quarters 
var measures the amount of a portfolio at risk for outcomes standard deviations from the mean based on normal market conditions over a one year time horizon and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio s initial value 
in other words  of the time  should the risks taken into account in the var model perform per their historical tendencies  the portfolio s loss in any one year period is expected to be less than or equal to the calculated var  stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio s initial value 
as of december   our portfolio s var was estimated to be  compared to an estimated at december  equities and privately held securities 
our investment portfolio includes an allocation to other investments which include investments in certain stock index funds  other preferred stocks and privately held securities 
at december  and  the fair value of our investments in equities and privately held securities totaled million and million  respectively 
these securities are exposed to price risk  which is the potential loss arising from decreases in the market value of equities

based on historical observations  there is a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the us dollar in the same direction and at the same time and  accordingly  the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest rates 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects of inflation on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled
