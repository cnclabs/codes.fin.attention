item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this k 
the following discussion and analysis of our historical consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a holding company with operations being conducted by our subsidiaries 
our specialty property and casualty insurance companies are licensed in all states  the district of columbia and the cayman islands 
we generate underwriting profits by providing what we view as specialized insurance products  services and programs not generally available in the marketplace 
while many companies write property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  we believe that few write passenger transportation coverage nationwide and very few write coverage for several of the classes of passenger transportation insurance written by us and our subsidiaries 
we focus on niche insurance markets where we offer insurance products designed to meet the unique needs of targeted insurance buyers that we believe are underserved by the insurance industry 
these niche markets typically possess what we view as barriers to entry  such as being too small  too remote or too difficult to attract or sustain most competitors 
examples of products that we write for these markets include property and casualty insurance for transportation companies of gross written premiums  captive programs for transportation companies that we refer to as our alternative risk transfer operations  specialty personal lines  primarily recreational vehicle coverage and transportation and general commercial insurance in hawaii and alaska 
we strive to become a market leader in the specialty markets that we choose and serve by offering what we believe are specialized products  excellent customer service and superior claims response 
we write insurance for various sizes of transportation fleets 
because of the amount of smaller fleets nationwide  we have more opportunities to write smaller risks than larger ones 
when general economic conditions improve  entrepreneurs are encouraged to start new transportation companies  which typically commence operations as a smaller risk and a potential traditional insurance customer for us 
during periods of economic downturn  such as immediately following september   smaller risks are more prone to failure due to a decrease in leisure travel and consolidation in the industry 
an increase in the number of larger risks results in more prospective captive insurance customers 
we do not believe that smaller fleets that generate annual premiums of less than  are large enough to retain the risks associated with participation in one of the captive programs we currently offer 
by offering insurance products to all sizes of risks  we believe we have hedged against the possibility that there will be a reduction in demand for the products we offer 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to grow and profit with both traditional and alternative risk transfer customers based on our assumptions regarding future economic and competitive conditions 
we generally incur low start up costs for new businesses  typically less than  incurred over several quarters 
we believe our flexible processes and scalable systems  along with controlled ramp up of businesses  allow us to manage costs and match them with the revenue flow 
the factors that impact our growth rate are consistent across all products 
however  the trends impacting each of these factors may vary from time to time for individual products 
those factors are as follows submissions the increase or decrease in the number of new applications we receive 
this is influenced by the effectiveness of our marketing activities compared to the marketing activities of our competitors in each market 
the change in the number of current policyholders that are available for a renewal quote 
the number of policyholders available for renewal changes based upon the economic conditions impacting our customer groups and the extent of consolidation that may be taking place within the industries we support 

table of contents quotes the change in the percentage of the new applications received that do not receive a quote from us 
we do not quote risks that do not meet our risk selection criteria or for which we have not been provided complete application data 
we refer to this ratio as the declination ratio and an increasing declination ratio usually results in reduced opportunities to write new business 
sales the change in percentage of the quotes we issue that are actually sold 
we refer to this ratio as the hit ratio 
hit ratios are affected by the number of competitors  the prices quoted by these competitors and the degree of difference between the competitors pricing  terms and conditions and ours 
rates the change in our rate structure from period to period 
the rates we file and quote are impacted by several factors including the cost and extent of the reinsurance we purchase  our operating efficiencies  our average loss costs  which reflect the effectiveness of our underwriting  our underwriting profit expectations  and our claims adjusting processes 
the difference between our rates and the rates of our competitors is the primary factor impacting the revenue growth of our established product lines 
product offerings and distribution we operate in multiple markets with multiple distribution approaches to attempt to reduce the probability that an adverse competitive response in any single market will have a significant impact on our overall business 
we also attempt to maintain several new products  product line extensions or product distribution approaches in active development status so we are able to take advantage of market opportunities 
we select from potential new product ideas based on our stated new business criteria and the anticipated competitive response 
industry and trends the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical 
historically  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity soft market followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market 
since  we believe that the commercial transportation market has been in the part of the cycle that can best be described as softening as compared to the peak of the hard market in and the cyclical nature of the industry impacts our business operations 
our business may be affected by the risks impacting the property and casualty insurance industry related to severe weather conditions  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
for passenger transportation  distressed operators whether distressed due to being insured by other insurance companies that have raised rates or exited the market  or due to having less than desirable risk characteristics continue to be heavily marketed to us by brokers causing an increase in our new business declination rates 
in addition  insurance rates for renewing policies for all transportation business remains relatively flat when compared to and lower than the increases attained from mid through although the current condition of the market can be characterized as softening  the extent of the price competition we are currently experiencing is neither as significant nor as severe as we have previously experienced in other softening markets eg 
increased rate levels beyond those necessary to keep up with inflation and achieve our planned financial targets prior to and relatively flat pricing since have resulted in us attaining combined ratios better than our corporate objective of maintaining a combined ratio of or lower 
while our combined ratio may fluctuate from year to year  over the past five years we have exceeded our underwriting profit objective by achieving an average gaap combined ratio of 
our gaap combined ratio was in  in  in  in and in we believe the following factors have contributed to this performance our business model and bottom line orientation have resulted in disciplined and consistent risk assessment and pricing adequacy 

table of contents our ability to attract and retain some of the best transportation companies in the industries we serve into our captive programs 
our stable operating expenses at or below the revenue growth rate 
for weather related events such as hurricanes  tornados and hailstorms  we conduct an analysis at least annually pursuant to which we input our in force exposures vehicle values in all states and property limits in hawaii into an independent catastrophe model that predicts our probable maximum loss at various statistical confidence levels 
our estimated probable maximum loss is impacted by changes in our in force exposures as well as changes to the assumptions inherent in the catastrophe model 
hurricane and other weather related events have not had a material negative impact on our past results 
in  we had no material impact on total losses incurred from hurricanes or other catastrophic events  however  severe hurricanes in the third and fourth quarter of resulted in approximately million in total incurred losses 
our transportation insurance business in particular also is affected by cost trends that negatively impact profitability such as inflation in vehicle repair costs  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs 
we routinely obtain independent data for vehicle repair inflation  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs and adjust our pricing routines to attempt to more accurately project the future costs associated with insurance claims 
historically  these increased costs have not had a material adverse impact on our results 
of course  we would expect a negative impact on our future results if we fail to properly account for and project for these inflationary trends 
increased litigation of claims may also negatively impact our profitability 
as described below  the average revenue dollar per personal lines policy is significantly lower than typical commercial policies 
profitability in the specialty personal lines component is dependent on proper pricing and the efficiency of underwriting and policy administration 
we continuously strive to improve our underwriting and policy issuance functions to keep this cost element as low as possible by utilizing current technology advances 
to succeed as a transportation underwriter and personal lines underwriter  we must understand and be able to quantify the different risk characteristics of the operations we consider quoting 
certain coverages are more stable and predictable than others and we must recognize the various components of the risks we assume when we write any specific class of insurance business 
examples of trends that can change and  therefore  impact our profitability are loss frequency  loss severity  geographic loss cost differentials  societal and legal factors impacting loss costs such as tort reform  punitive damage inflation and increasing jury awards and changes in regulation impacting the insurance relationship 
any changes in these factors that are not recognized and priced for accordingly will affect our future profitability 
we believe our product management organization provides the focus on a specific risk class needed to stay current with the trends affecting each specific class of business we write 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our insurance policies and income from our investment portfolio 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
as with all property and casualty companies  the impact of price increases is reflected in our financial results over time 
price increases on our in force policies occur as they are renewed  which generally takes twelve months for our entire book of business and up to an additional twelve months to earn a full year of premium at the higher rate 
insurance rates charged on renewing policies have remained relatively flat in compared to there are distinct differences in the timing of written premiums in traditional transportation insurance and our alternative risk transfer captive insurance components 
we write traditional transportation insurance policies throughout all months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under most captive programs  all members of the group share a common renewal date 
these common renewal dates are scheduled throughout the calendar year 
any new captive program participant that joins after the common date will be written for other than a full annual term so its next renewal date coincides with the common expiration date of the captive program it has joined 
historically  most of our group captives had common renewal dates in the first six months of the year  but with the growth from new captive programs  we are now experiencing renewal dates 
table of contents throughout the calendar year 
the alternative risk transfer component of our business grew to of total gross premium written during as compared to in the projected profitability from the traditional transportation and transportation captive businesses are substantially comparable 
increased investment income opportunities generally are available with traditional insurance but the lower acquisition expenses and persistence of the captive programs generally provide for lower operating expenses from these programs 
the lower expenses associated with our captives generally offset the projected reductions in investment income potential 
from a projected profitability perspective  we are ambivalent as to whether a transportation operator elects to purchase traditional insurance or one of our captive program options 
all of our transportation products  traditional or alternative risk transfer  are priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
because traditional insurance tends to have a higher operating expense structure  the portion of the premiums available to pay losses tends to be lower for a traditional insurance quote versus an alternative risk transfer insurance quote 
we use a cost plus pricing approach that projects future losses based upon the insured s historic losses and other factors 
operating expenses  premium taxes  expenses and a profit margin are then added to the projected loss component to achieve the total premium to be quoted 
the lower the projected losses  expenses and taxes  the lower the total quoted premiums regardless of whether it is a traditional or alternate risk transfer program quotation 
quoted premiums are computed in accordance with our approved insurance department filings in each state 
our specialty personal lines products are also priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
the average premium per policy for this business component is significantly less than transportation lines 
we employ what we consider to be a conservative approach to investment and capital management with the intention of supporting insurance operations by providing a stable source of income to offset underwriting risk and growing income to offset inflation 
the priority of goals of our investment policy are to preserve principal  generate income  maintain required liquidity and achieve capital appreciation 
our board of directors has established investment guidelines and reviews the portfolio performance quarterly for compliance with its established guidelines 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of losses and lae  commissions and other underwriting expenses  and other operating and general expenses 
losses and lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we record losses and lae based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to estimate losses and lae accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written  and to a lesser extent ceding commissions paid to ceding insurers and excise taxes 
other operating and general expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries  benefits and certain costs associated with awards under our equity compensation plans  such as stock compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r and other general operating expenses 
other than expenses relating to stock options and other equity grants  our personnel expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expenses are disclosed separately from operating and general expenses 

table of contents results of operations overview our net earnings for were million or per share diluted  compared to million or per share diluted recorded in our earnings increased million  or  compared to the same period in there are several factors that contributed to the increase in net earnings  including continued growth in earned premium of million  or  primarily due to the addition of new captive programs and an increase in the number of participants in our existing captive programs 
we also had favorable losses and lae for  which is evidenced by our loss and lae ratio of  a decrease from prior year of percent 
the current year losses and lae include favorable development from prior years of million 
also contributing to the increase in our net earnings in was an increase in investment income of million  or  due to higher interest rates available on our fixed income investments and growth in our cash flow from operations 
gross premiums written we operate our business as one segment property and casualty insurance 
we manage this segment through a product management structure 
the following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by business component during the periods indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other gross premiums written the group captive programs  which focus on specialty or niche insurance businesses  provide various services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with providing various types of property and casualty insurance coverage 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
gross written premium includes both direct premium and assumed premium 
during  as a percent of total gross premiums written  the alternative risk transfer component of the business had the largest increase of million or percent compared to the growth in the alternative risk transfer component is primarily attributable to the addition in of seven new captive programs  which accounted for million  or  of the increase  as well as an increase in the number of participants in our existing captive programs 
additionally  to better offer an attractive group captive option to larger truck fleets  in one of our largest captive programs split into two captives 
this new group captive opted to change their renewal date to october which resulted in an increase to gross written premium of million 
as part of our captive programs  we have analyzed  on a quarterly basis  captive members loss performance on a policy year basis to determine if there would be a premium assessment to participants  or if there would be a return of premium to participants as a result of less than expected losses 
assessment premium and return of premium are recorded as adjustments to written premium assessments increase written premium  returns of premium reduce written premium 
until  this review has always generated net assessment premium 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded return of premium of million and assessment of premium of million  respectively  thus generating a million year over year reduction in the alternative risk transfer 
table of contents component s written premium 
exclusive of this million reduction to gross written premium  the captive business would have shown an increase in growth over of million  or 
also contributing to the increase in the gross premiums written in was an increase in the specialty personal lines component of million or as compared to the increase is primarily related to a moderate rate increase as well as an increase in the number of policies in force associated with the recreational and companion auto vehicle programs 
the decrease in the transportation component of million for the year ended december  compared to  is the result of our continued application of our underwriting discipline even in a softening market with increased competition 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forgo volume as a result 
based on the number of accounts  our retention rates for traditional transportation are comparable between and  however  we are experiencing a trend of competitive pricing on larger traditional accounts impacting premium to a greater degree than in prior periods 
for we maintained flat rate levels on renewing commercial insurance business while our renewal hit ratios have been deteriorating to historic levels from the elevated levels we had in and due primarily to an increase in our alaska business in  our hawaii and alaska component increased million for the year ended december  compared to our other component is primarily related to assigned risk policies that we receive from involuntary state insurance plans and over which we have no control 
this component decreased million from premiums earned compared to the following table shows revenues for the years ended december  and summarized by the broader business component description  which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics  products and services year ended december  change revenue amount percent dollars in thousands premiums earned alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other total premiums earned our premiums earned increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our alternative risk transfer component increased during compared to the same period in  primarily due to new captive programs that were written in and the fourth quarter of and new participants in existing group captive programs 
our alternative risk transfer business remains our fastest growing component 
due to moderate rate increases and an increase in the number of policies in force primarily from expanded distribution  our specialty personal lines component increased in compared to the transportation component remained relatively constant in compared to in the transportation component  we are still feeling the effects from a million decline in premium from a reinsurance arrangement involving primarily physical damage coverage on trucks and seeing a decline in renewal rate increases due to the current softening market 
our other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate  and over which we have no control  decreased million  or  to million in

during and prior periods  our alternative risk transfer business was one of the fastest growing components of our business 
a portion of the new customers in the alternative risk transfer component were larger premium customers that were previously in our transportation component 
due to an increase in the number of policies in force primarily from expanded distribution  our specialty personal lines component increased in compared to the transportation component remained relatively constant in compared to the slight decrease in the transportation component is primarily due to i a decline in assumed premium from a reinsurance arrangement involving primarily physical damage coverage on trucks because the company with whom we had the agreement elected to exit the business and ii larger premium customers moving from the transportation component to our captive programs in the alternative risk transfer component 
our other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate  increased or million to million in the increase in this component was primarily due to an increase in our assigned risk premiums 
underwriting and loss ratio analysis underwriting profitability  as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings  is measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forego volume as a result 
from through  our insurance subsidiaries increased their premium rates to offset rising losses and reinsurance costs 
we have maintained flat rate levels on renewal business in as compared to the increase in rates in  and 
table of contents the table below presents our premiums earned and combined ratios for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands gross premiums written ceded reinsurance net premiums written change in unearned premiums  net of ceded net premiums earned combined ratios loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the ratio of losses and lae to premiums earned 
the ratio of the sum of commissions and other underwriting expenses  other operating expenses less other income to premiums earned 
compared to losses and lae increased million  or  for compared to the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss and lae ratio in of percent is primarily due to favorable development of million from prior years loss reserves compared to favorable development in of million 
the increase in favorable development lowered the loss ratio by percent 
consistent with prior years  we strive to be accurate  but tend to be conservative with our loss reserving methodology in areas where we are still experiencing double digit growth patterns 
the favorable development for both years was primarily the settlements below the established case reserves and revisions to our estimated future settlements on an individual case by case basis 
this savings represents just under and for and  respectively of the prior year reserves 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written  and ceding commissions paid to ceding insurers and excise taxes 
the commissions and other underwriting expenses increased million for compared to this increase in the commissions and other underwriting expenses is primarily due to an increase in commissions  premium taxes and other related expenses which are directly impacted by the growth in gross written premiums  and by two reclassifications that were made in  which reduced the commissions and other underwriting expenses in that year  as noted below 
the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended december  increased percent to compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the expense ratio is due to an increase in other operating and general expenses such as increased audit fees due to the audit of our insurance companies coordinated by the ohio department of insurance million  the impact of stock based compensation expense recognized in million and other costs associated with our growth and with being a publicly traded corporation 
also impacting the change in the expense ratio were two items that occurred in i a reduction in estimated expenses for insolvencies and other state fees and ii classifying business related to our assigned risks on a gross basis 
these items reduced the expense ratio by percent and are discussed in further detail below 
when taking these items into consideration the expense ratio remained consistent from to compared to the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the loss and lae ratio from to of percent is primarily due to the fact that approximately of the increase in premiums earned in was produced by the alternative risk transfer and other component 
historically  these components have higher loss and 
table of contents lae ratios than our traditional components  and as a result had the effect of raising the loss ratio in this increase is mostly offset by a million favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
we consider the variance in the loss and lae ratio of percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  to be consistent with management s expectations that losses would deteriorate slightly based on our flat renewal rates and historical loss patterns 
the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended december  decreased points to compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio is primarily a result of four factors increased risk retention  continued leverage of our fixed expense  a reduction in our estimated expenses for insolvencies and other state fees and recording of assigned business 
in november  we increased our risk retention on public transportation products  which contributes to a decrease in our expense ratio as the additional retained written premium is earned 
while expenses are higher in response to building our infrastructure and other related expenses of operating as a public entity  our overall increase in fixed expenses was lower than the revenue growth for the year ended december  using data available from the national conference of insurance guarantee funds  we reduced our estimated expenses for insolvencies and other state fees during the third quarter of the reduction in estimated expenses reduced our underwriting expense ratio by percent 
we record our assigned risk premium quarterly based on reports from various states and agencies that manage the plans 
the assignments are based on our written premium for specific coverages in certain states 
we have written workers compensation insurance in several states beginning in due to the lack of sufficient detail because the plans report to us on a lag  our estimated net share of the assigned risks were charged to commissions and other underwriting expenses  with a like amount recorded as assessments and fees payable in the correct periods 
during the third and fourth quarter of  sufficient information was obtained to enable us to classify the business on a gross basis  including premiums earned and losses and lae 
while this had no impact on net income  it reduced our underwriting expense ratio by percent 
investment income compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is primarily related to a growth in average cash and invested assets over the same period and a higher yield on the fixed income portfolio 
the growth in cash and invested assets is due to positive cash flow from operations and the reinvestment of earnings 
compared to net investment income increased million  or to million in compared to  due primarily to a growth in average cash and invested assets over the same period 
the increase in cash and invested assets reflected the growth in premiums written and the proceeds  net of debt repayment  of million from the ipo in february of realized gains losses on investments compared to net realized gains increased million to million for compared to net realized gains of million for realized gains are taken when opportunities arise 
the realized gains in and were primarily generated from sales of equity holdings 
when evaluating fixed maturity sales opportunities  we do not have any specific thresholds that would cause us to sell these securities prior to maturity 
we consider multiple factors  such as reinvestment alternatives and specific circumstances of the investment currently held 
credit quality  portfolio allocation and other than temporary impairment are other factors that may encourage us to sell a fixed maturity security prior to maturity at a gain or loss 
historically  and during the most recent extended low interest rate period  we have not had the need to sell our investments to generate liquidity 
compared to net realized gains decreased million to million for compared to net realized gains of million for the net realized gain in was partially offset by an other than temporary impairment adjustment of million recognized in the decrease in net realized gains in was due to fewer sales opportunities in the fixed income market in

income taxes the effective tax rate was  remaining unchanged from while the low tax rate on profits generated by hmg reduced the effective tax rate by approximately  that reduction was offset by an increase in income tax expense from the non deductibility of certain expenses 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for further analysis of items affecting our effective tax rate 
financial condition investments at december   our investment portfolio contained million in fixed maturity securities and million in equity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   we had pretax net unrealized losses of million on fixed maturities and pretax unrealized gains of million on equity securities 
at december   of the fixed maturities in our portfolio were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by standard poor s corporation 
investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade

table of contents when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than temporary impairment 
net realized gains on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows net realized gains losses charges for on sales impairment total dollars in thousands year ended liquidity and capital resources capital ratios 
the national association of insurance commissioners model law for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december  and  the capital and surplus of all our insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds 
the liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and payments of dividends and taxes to us from insurance subsidiaries 
historically cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without requiring the sale of investments 
if our cash flows change dramatically from historical patterns  for example as a result of a decrease in premiums or an increase in claims paid or operating expenses  we may be required to sell securities before their maturity and possibly at a loss 
our insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments to meet their liquidity needs 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
our historic pattern of using receipts from current premium writings for the payment of liabilities incurred in prior periods has enabled us to extend slightly the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of our loss reserves 
our insurance subsidiaries generate liquidity primarily by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a million increase from december  for  and  we generated consolidated cash flow from operations of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in is attributable to an increase in net income of million  as well as various fluctuations within the operating activities associated with our growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to a million decrease in the purchase of investments in and an million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments as compared to also impacting investing activities was the purchase  by niic  of an office building adjacent to our headquarters in richfield  ohio 
the building was purchased for million 
an additional payment of million was also made on january  for the remaining balance of the purchase price associated with the acquisition of tcc 
as part of this acquisition  we acquired million in cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents we utilized net cash from financing activities of million and provided net cash of million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the million decrease in cash generated from financing activities primarily relates to the initial public offering completed in february whereby we sold  shares of common stock  generating approximately million of net proceeds 
we used the net proceeds for the repayment in full of a million loan plus the accrued interest from great american  our majority shareholder  and the remainder is currently being used as needed for general corporate purposes and potential growth opportunities 
we will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from dividend and tax payments from our insurance company subsidiaries and from our line of credit 
under the state insurance laws  dividends and capital distributions from our insurance companies are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
the maximum amount of dividends that our insurance companies could pay to us without seeking regulatory approval in is million 
our insurance subsidiaries paid million and in dividends in and  respectively  without the need for regulatory approval 
under tax allocation and cost sharing agreements among nic and its subsidiaries  taxes and expenses are allocated among the entities 
the federal income tax provision of our individual subsidiaries is computed as if the subsidiary filed a separate tax return 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from us 
in may  we purchased the outstanding common equity of a business trust that issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities 
the trust used the proceeds from the issuance of its capital securities and common equity to buy million of debentures issued by us 
these debentures are the trust s only assets and mature in the interest rate is equal to the three month libor at december  and at december  plus basis points with interest payments due quarterly 
payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the capital securities 
we have the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  on or after may  we used the net proceeds from the debentures to fund our obligations to our subsidiaries and to increase the capitalization of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we also have a million line of credit unused at december  that bears interest at the lending institution s prime rate at december  and at december  less basis points and requires an annual commitment fee of thousand 
in accordance with the terms of the line of credit agreement  interest payments are due monthly and the principal balance is due upon demand 
the line of credit is available currently  and has been used in the past  for general corporate purposes  including the capitalization of our insurance company subsidiaries in order to support the growth of their written premiums 
we may request an increase in this line of credit in the future based on liquidity and capital needs  although we have no immediate plans to do so 
in august  our unsecured four year term loan matured and the balance was paid off 
we believe that the cash and short term investments at december   funds generated from operations and funds available under our line of credit will provide sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  if these funds are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  we would be required to generate cash through additional borrowings  sale of assets  sale of portfolio securities or similar transactions 
historically  we have not had the need to sell our investments to generate liquidity 
if we were forced to sell portfolio securities early for liquidity purposes rather than holding them to maturity  we could recognize gains or losses on those securities earlier than anticipated 
if we were forced to borrow additional funds in order to meet liquidity needs  we would incur additional interest expense which would have a negative impact on our earnings 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond a month period is dependent upon factors such as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
at december   we had million held in an escrow account for the purchase of tcc from triumphe insurance holdings llc by niic 
the million that was held in an escrow account is shown on the december   consolidated balance sheet in other assets 
on january   the first business day after the january effective date of the purchase  the funds were released from the escrow account 
we made a second payment of million for the remaining balance of the purchase price

contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period within more than total year years years years dollars in thousands gross unpaid losses and lae long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserve and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates  and the estimates provided do not reflect potential recoveries under reinsurance treaties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of loss and lae reserves and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are two areas where by the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
we discuss these two policies below 
our other significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of that loss to us and our final payment of that loss  and its related lae 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of gross losses and lae reserves  representing management s best estimate of the ultimate loss 
management records on a monthly and quarterly basis its best estimate of loss reserves 
for purposes of computing the recorded reserves  management utilizes various data inputs  including analysis that is derived from a review of prior quarter results performed by actuaries employed by great american 
in addition  on an annual basis  actuaries from great american review the recorded reserves for niic  niic hi and tcc utilizing current period data and provide a statement of actuarial opinion  required annually in accordance with state insurance regulations  on the statutory reserves recorded by these us insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial analysis of niic s  niic hi s and tcc s for  as we acquired tcc on january  net reserves as of december  and reflected point estimates that were within of management s recorded net reserves as of such dates 
using this actuarial data along with its other data inputs  management concluded that the recorded reserves appropriately reflect management s best estimates of the liability as of each year end 
the quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves by great american actuaries are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to the case incurred development method  the paid development method  
table of contents the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate and whether adjustments are needed to particular methods 
this information includes open and closed claim counts  average case reserves and average incurred on open claims  closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages  average closed claim severity  ultimate claim severity  reported loss ratios  projected ultimate loss ratios  and loss payment patterns 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
the sensitivity of recorded reserves to an unexpected change in the trends  is estimated by adding to the trend that is embedded in the factors used to determine the reserves for ultimate liabilities 
this unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies  or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
the estimated cumulative unfavorable impact that this change would have on our net income is shown below cumulative line of business impact commercial auto liability million workers compensation million commercial auto liability 
in this line of business  we provide coverage protecting buses  limousines  other public transportation vehicles and trucking for accidents causing property damage or personal injury to others 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto liability include litigious climate  unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues  magnitude of jury awards  outside counsel costs  and frequency and timing of claims reporting 
workers compensation 
in this line of business  we provide coverage for employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations  future medical cost inflation  and timing of claims reporting 
within each line  great american actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information and input from management to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  a weighted average of several tests  or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate and to 
table of contents provide management with a consulting opinion regarding the advisability of modifying its reserve setting assumptions for future periods 
the great american actuaries do not develop ranges of losses 
the level of detail at which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
we generally analyze data by major product or coverage  using countrywide data 
we determine the appropriate segmentation of the data based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business and other actuarial considerations 
point estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
claims we view as potentially significant are subject to a rigorous review process involving the adjuster  claims management and executive management 
we seek to establish reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historic claims experience 
incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr reserves are determined separate from the case reserving process and include estimates for potential adverse development of the recorded case reserves 
we monitor ibnr reserves monthly with financial management and quarterly with an actuary from great american 
ibnr reserves are adjusted monthly based on historic patterns and current trends and exposures 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of our claims personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
individual case reserves are reviewed for adequacy at least quarterly by senior claims management 
when establishing and reviewing reserves  we analyze historic data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historic loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
a change in any of these factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves  and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves 
currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual occurrences 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are increased or strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to income in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a benefit to income in the period that redundancy is recognized 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves 
in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to we did not significantly change our reserving methodology or our claims settlement process in any of these years 
the development reflected settlements that differed from the established case reserves  changes in the case reserves based on new information for that specific claim or the differences in the timing of actual settlements compared to the payout patterns assumed in our accident year ibnr reductions 
the types of coverages we offer and risk levels we retain have a direct influence on the development of claims 
specifically  short duration claims and lower risk retention levels generally are more predictable and normally have less development 
future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past development experience should not be assumed or estimated 
the reserves reported in the financial statements are our best estimate 

table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of our reserves between case reserves estimated amounts required to settle claims that have already been reported  ibnr reserves estimated amounts that will be needed to settle claims that have already occurred but have not yet been reported to us  as well as reserves for possible development on known claims and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves gross loss reserves at december  statutory lines of business case ibnr lae total dollars in thousands commercial auto liability workers compensation auto physical damage general liability private passenger inland marine commercial multiple peril other lines reinsurance recoverables 
we are also subject to credit risks with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risks to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all these risks 
as a result  reinsurance does not limit our ultimate obligation to pay claims to policyholders and we may not be able to recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we manage this credit risk by selecting what we believe to be quality reinsurers  closely monitoring their financial condition  timely billing and collecting amounts due and obtaining sufficient collateral when necessary 
other than temporary impairment our investments are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation risks 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  economic stability of an entire industry sector or subsection  whether the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss  the extent to which the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data  internally generated financial models and forecasts  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and 
table of contents other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
we closely monitor each investment that has a market value that is below its amortized cost and make a determination each quarter for other than temporary impairment for each of those investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded no impairment adjustments 
we recorded a million impairment adjustment in and no impairment adjustments in  respectively 
none of the primarily fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of december   and  were deemed to have any fundamental issues that would lead us to believe that they were other than temporarily impaired 
because total unrealized losses are a component of shareholders equity  any recognition of other than temporary impairment losses has no effect on our comprehensive income or book value 
see management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
fixed maturity portfolio 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in interest rates  in addition to credit risk 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
we believe this practice allows us to be flexible in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
we manage the portfolios of our insurance companies to attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
we invest in an evolving mix of traditional fixed income and variable rate notes  including step up rate and range notes  in our fixed maturity portfolio to capture what we believe are adequate risk adjusted returns in an evolving investment environment 
the following table provides information about our available for sale fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows expected principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and collectively for all years thereafter 
we include callable bonds and notes based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield

we manage equity price risk primarily through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques such as investing in exchange traded funds
