table of contents expressed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
these include  but are not limited to  those described above under item a  risk factors 
overview we own and operate dental laboratories located in states and one canadian province  serving an active customer base of over  dentists 
our business consists of the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
our products are grouped into the following three main categories restorative products 
restorative products that our dental laboratories sell consist primarily of crowns and bridges 
a crown replaces the part of a tooth that is visible  and is usually made of gold  porcelain or zirconia 
a bridge is a restoration of one or more missing teeth that is permanently attached to the natural teeth or roots 
in addition to the traditional crown  we also make porcelain jackets  which are crowns constructed entirely of porcelain  onlays  which are partial crowns which do not cover all of the visible tooth  and precision crowns  which are restorations designed to receive and connect a removable partial denture 
we also make inlays  which are restorations made to fit a prepared tooth cavity and then cemented into place 
reconstructive products 
reconstructive products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of partial dentures and full dentures 
partial dentures are removable dental prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures 
full dentures are dental prostheses that substitute for the total loss of teeth and associated structures 
we also sell precision attachments  which connect a crown and an artificial prosthesis  and implants  which are fixtures anchored securely in the bone of the mouth to which a crown  partial or full denture is secured by means of screws or clips 
cosmetic products 
cosmetic products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of porcelain veneers and ceramic crowns 
porcelain veneers are thin coverings of porcelain cemented to the front of a tooth to enhance personal appearance 
ceramic crowns are crowns made from ceramic materials that most closely replicate natural teeth 
we also sell composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance  and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
the economic conditions affecting our operations and the dental laboratory industry in general have remained less than favorable over the past several years as many patients and dentists continue to postpone optimal treatment plans  such as crowns  and pursue less expensive alternatives such as amalgam fillings  for which we recognize no revenue 
in  we experienced internal sales growth of  which included selling price increases during the period ranging from to at various laboratories and on various product lines 
during  internal sales growth was  including the effect of increased prices due to underlying increases in the prices of precious metals 
we believe that the low cost segment for united states based dental laboratories has stopped growing and has begun to shrink as competition from offshore laboratories  primarily those located in china  makes inroads into the domestic marketplace 
while our business has not focused on this low cost segment of the market  we have experienced some price pressure from other laboratories in our marketplaces that has restrained our ability to increase prices at this time 
in addition  we face growing competition from technology based solutions that allow dentists to fabricate their own restorations without the use of a dental laboratory 
both of these trends appear to be impacting industry growth  and have been inhibiting our results of operations 
technology based dental laboratory cad cam manufacturing solutions have required additional investments in capital equipment 
while we expect these capital expenditures will benefit future periods  they have not yet positively impacted net income 
the main components of our costs are labor and related employee benefits 
over the past several years  competition for labor resources and increases in medical insurance premiums have driven these costs higher 
we have begun to adjust staffing levels as appropriate at each of our locations while recognizing the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce 
in we experienced cost pressure resulting from the implementation expenditures necessary to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the impact of these various section implementation costs on earnings for fiscal year was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes  with most of that occurring in the fourth quarter 
for fiscal  the cost of maintaining our compliance with 
table of contents section was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes 
in  these costs were approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes 
we believe that while external costs will decrease in as a result of revisions to standards governing the audit of internal control over financial reporting  these significant ongoing expenditures will still be required to maintain our compliance with the internal controls framework required by the sarbanes oxley act 
we have also continued to pursue our acquisition strategy  which has played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in we recognize acquired customer relationships and trade names as intangible assets which require the recognition of amortization expense for the customer relationships and impairment testing for the customer relationships  trade names and goodwill 
on a prospective basis  our future amortization expense will increase based upon our recent and any future acquisition activity 
the amount recognized for customer relationships and subsequent amortization expense will depend on the expected profitability and customer retention characteristics of our recently acquired businesses together with those  if any  that we may subsequently acquire 
effective march  we completed what was then our largest acquisition to date  green dental laboratories  inc green 
we believe that the synergies created by the addition of this laboratory have created value for our organization as a whole 
green is treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes and retains a separate company identity as a wholly owned subsidiary 
effective october   we completed what is now our largest acquisition to date  that of keller group  incorporated keller of st 
louis  missouri 
keller is also treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
with annual revenues in excess of  keller differs from national dentex in its approach to marketing and to the marketplace 
in recent years keller has broadened its focus from local markets in the midwest to the national marketplace 
in order to sustain this strategy  keller invests significantly in product advertising  primarily in dental print publications 
as a result  we expect keller to return lower net margins initially than our other operating segments but conversely expect it to obtain stronger sales growth prospectively 
we believe that the addition of the keller management team has created value for our organization as a whole 
on january   we announced a realignment of our corporate organization in order to help us better execute our operational strategy 
in order to finance the purchase of green and keller  we borrowed approximately  in long term debt 
future acquisitions may also be financed using available debt financing 
as a result of our acquisitions of green and keller we are more highly leveraged than we were previously 
our interest expense has therefore become a more significant component of our pre tax earnings 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the earnings performance of green and other acquisitions have contributed positively to our sales and gross margins  although our gross margins declined in by to compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   net sales increased  or with  attributable to recent acquisitions  measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
gross profit in fiscal increased by  to  however  of this gross profit was attributable to our acquisitions in as a result  all other laboratories experienced an overall decrease in gross profit of  green s results for included a full year of sales compared to ten months in keller s results for included three months of sales in liquidity and capital resources our working capital decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of additional borrowings to fund acquisitions  partially offset by  in cash proceeds from the sale of our former facility in houston  texas and other increases in cash associated with our operating results 
cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at december  to  at december  operating activities provided  in cash flow for the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased net income and increased depreciation and amortization expense of 
table of contents  as a result of acquisitions and new facilities increased benefit for deferred income taxes of  as a result of increased deferred tax liabilities for incentive and deferred compensation decreases in prepaid expenses of  related primarily to timing differences in prepaid insurance and prepaid income taxes  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of cash outflows related to dental laboratory acquisitions  including deferred purchase price payments associated with prior period acquisitions  totaled  for the year ended december   primarily resulting from the acquisition of keller  compared to  for the year ended december   primarily resulting from the acquisition of green 
we executed a financing agreement dated june  the agreement with fleet national bank  now known as bank of america  na the bank 
the agreement included a revolving line of credit of  and a revolving acquisition line of credit of  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit was the prime rate or  at our option  the london interbank offered rate libor  or a cost of funds rate plus a range of 
to depending on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
both revolving lines of credit were to terminate on june  an unused facility fee of one eighth of per annum was payable on the unused amount of the first revolving line of credit 
a facility fee of  per year was required on the acquisition line of credit 
on august  the agreement was superseded by an amended and restated agreement the amended agreement with the bank that added a five year credit facility in the form of a term loan in the principal amount of  amounts previously borrowed under the revolving acquisition line of credit were repaid under the term loan facility  creating  of availability under the acquisition line of credit 
additionally  certain terms and conditions of the original agreement were amended 
the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit and the term loan was the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate  or the bank s fixed rate plus a range of to depending on the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the amended agreement 
the amended agreement required monthly payments of principal on the term loan  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the amended agreement 
the amended agreement required compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth and other financial ratios 
in october we borrowed against our acquisition line of credit to finance our acquisition of keller 
as a result of this acquisition  we and the bank executed a second amended and restated loan agreement as of november  the second agreement comprising unsecured senior credit facilities totaling  the second agreement amends and restates the amended agreement a to increase the term loan facility to an aggregate principal amount of  and use the proceeds of the increase in the term loan to repay the portion of the outstanding principal balance under the acquisition line of credit and b to adjust the allocation of availability under the lines of credit by increasing the revolving line of credit to   of which may be used for future acquisitions and decreasing the acquisition line of credit from  to  the interest rate on both lines of credit and the term loan is now the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate or the bank s fixed rate  plus  in each case  a range of to  depending on the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as each is defined in the second agreement 
the term loan facility portion of the second agreement requires monthly interest payments and monthly payments of principal  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the second agreement 
the acquisition line of credit and the first line of credit mature on the third anniversary of the second agreement 
the second agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth and other financial ratios 
as of december    was available under the revolving line of credit and  was available under the acquisition line of credit 
as a result of the keller acquisition  at december  we had additional short term bank debt in the amount of  that was repaid on january  december  december  total long term debt less current maturities long term debt  less current portion 
table of contents the table below reflects the expected repayment terms associated with the term loan facility at december  the interest rate associated with our current borrowings was as of december  december  principal due fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total we believe that cash flow from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet contemplated operating and capital requirements and deferred payments associated with prior acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than greater than total year years years years term loan facility interest expense capital leases operating leases real estate vehicles equipment laboratory purchase obligations contingent laboratory purchase price total in november  we converted borrowings on our acquisition line of credit to our new term loan facility 
bank borrowings on the term loan facility  with repayment terms greater than one year  are classified as long term debt on the balance sheet 
interest expense payments  included in the above table  related to the term loan facility have been projected using the interest rate associated with current borrowings 
we are committed under various non cancelable operating lease agreements covering office space and dental laboratory facilities  vehicles and certain equipment 
certain of these leases also require us to pay maintenance  repairs  insurance and related taxes 
laboratory purchase obligations totaling  classified as deferred acquisition costs  are presented in the liability section of the balance sheet 
these obligations  including deferred obligations associated with non competition agreements  represent purchase price commitments arising from dental laboratory acquisitions  irrespective of the acquired laboratory s earnings performance 
contingent laboratory purchase price includes amounts subject to acquisition agreements that are tied to laboratory earnings performance  as defined within the acquisition agreements  generally over a three year period 
as payments become determinable  they are recorded in our purchase price allocation

results of operations our results are reported within three operating segments  ndx laboratories  green dental and keller

net sales increased by approximately  as a result of acquisitions  measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
net sales increased approximately  or at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the year ended december   primarily as a result of price increases  most of which passed along some  but not all  of our higher precious metal costs to our customers 
competitive pressures from offshore laboratories that can produce crowns at fees lower than crowns manufactured in the united states have limited our ability to raise our prices during a time when have experienced higher than usual costs for precious metals used in manufacturing 
as a result  gross and net margins were unfavorably impacted 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the fiscal year ended december  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased from to 
the increase  which was primarily attributable to the ndx laboratories segment due to product mix  was mainly the result of increases in the cost of precious metals 
the cost of raw materials as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average cost of precious metals used as components of many dental alloys  including gold and palladium  increased approximately for gold and for palladium  over average costs in although we are able to pass a portion of precious metal cost increases on to our customers  prolonged higher metal costs have had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on gross profit percentages

we report on three operating segments within this single industry segment 
these three segments are known as green dental  representing the operations of green dental laboratories  inc of heber springs  arkansas which we acquired in march  keller  representing the operations of keller group  incorporated with laboratories in st

the majority of the internal growth was the result of commodity cost increases on precious metals  a portion of which is passed on to our customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  cost of goods sold increased by  the increase was attributable to additional costs from acquisitions of  increases in the cost of materials  primarily precious metals  of approximately  increases in manufacturing labor and benefits of approximately  resulting from an increase in health insurance costs and excess capacity  and laboratory overhead increases of approximately  resulting from new facilities and higher energy costs

laboratory operating income as a percentage of sales for green increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  keller this segment is the result of our acquisition of keller group  inc effective october   and therefore the sales are entirely attributable to acquisition growth 
keller operates with manufacturing efficiencies but also is pursuing growth with significant spending in product advertising  primarily in dental print publications
