item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking disclaimer please keep the forward looking disclaimer on page in mind as you review the following discussion and analysis 
overview competitive  economic and industry factors we are an energy company 
we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own power generating plants 
all of our five mines supply baseloaded power plants 
several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines  and we sell virtually all our coal under long term contracts 
consequently  our mines enjoy relatively stable demand and pricing compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market 
we now own of rova  which is also baseloaded and supplies power pursuant to long term contracts 
we operate and maintain rova and four power projects owned by others 
in partnership with others  we developed eight independent power projects totaling mw of generating capacity 
we sold our interests in five of those projects and retain our interest in rova and a interest in the gas fired ft 
lupton project  which has a generating capacity of mw and provides peaking power to the local utility 
according to the annual energy outlook prepared by the eia  approximately of all electricity generated in the united states in was produced by coal fired units 
the eia projects that the demand for coal used to generate electricity will increase approximately per year from through consequently  we believe that the demand for coal will grow  in part because coal is the lowest cost fossil fuel used for generating baseload electric power 
revenues and expenses in  we generated million of operating income  of which million came from coal operations  million from independent power operations  offset by million of expenses attributable to our heritage segment and million of expenses from our corporate segment 
meeting our commitment to preferred stockholders we remain committed to meeting our obligation for accumulated dividends to our preferred stockholders 
due to legal and business constraints  no dividends were declared from the third quarter of until on october  and for the following three quarters  a partial dividend of per depositary share was paid 
in october and october  the quarterly dividend was increased to and  respectively 
we paid quarterly dividends of per depositary share from october  through july  we suspended the payment of preferred stock dividends following the recognition of the deficit in shareholders equity described below 
the quarterly dividends which are accumulated through and including january  amount to million in the aggregate per preferred share or per depositary share 
we are currently reporting a deficit in shareholders equity 
as a result  we are now prohibited from paying preferred stock dividends because of the statutory restrictions limiting the payment of preferred stock dividends under delaware law  the state in which the company is incorporated 
under delaware law  the company is permitted to pay preferred stock dividends only to the extent that shareholders equity exceeds the par value of the preferred stock  at december  
table of contents challenges we believe that our principal challenges today include the following obtaining adequate capital for our on going operations and our growth initiatives  continuing to fund high heritage health benefit expenses which continue to be adversely affected by inflation in medical costs  longer life expectancies for retirees and the failure of the umwa retirement fund trustees to manage medical costs  maintaining and collateralizing  where necessary  our coal act and reclamation bonds  funding required contributions to pension plans that are underfunded  complying with new environmental regulations  which have the potential to significantly reduce sales from our mines  and defending against claims for potential taxes and royalties assessed by various governmental entities  some of which we believe are subject to reimbursement by our customers 
we discuss these issues  as well as the other challenges we face  elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and under risk factors 
internal control over financial reporting we are committed to maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
our accounting personnel report regularly to our audit committee on all accounting and financial matters 
in addition  our audit committee actively communicates with and oversees the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm 
during we believe we have remediated four of the five material weaknesses that were identified in and  in connection with the preparation of the form k and amendment no 
to our form k 
subsequent to december   we plan to remediate the material weakness reported in item a as of that date 
we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
see item a  risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and related matters our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have made significant judgments and estimates in connection with the following accounting matters 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the section below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in connection with our discussion of these critical accounting matters  we also use this section to present information related to these judgments and estimates 
postretirement benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligations are the obligations to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for more information about the assumptions and estimates associated with these obligations 

table of contents we estimate the total amount of these obligations with the help of third party actuaries using actuarial assumptions and information 
our estimates are sensitive to judgments we make about the discount rate  about the rate of inflation in medical costs  about mortality rates  and about the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of or medicare reform act on the benefits payable 
we review these estimates and the obligations at least annually 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  the entire amount of underfunded status of our pension and postretirement benefits is reflected as a liability on our financial statements 
actuarial valuations project that our heritage health benefit payments for retirees will increase annually until and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines at a rate sufficient to overcome the rate of medical cost inflation for those remaining 
beginning in  we began receiving medicare part d prescription drug reimbursements 
we expect that these reimbursements will reduce our cash payments by approximately million in the effect of a one percent change on our health care cost trend rate on our postretirement medical periodic costs and benefit obligations is summarized in the table below postretirement benefits increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect in postretirement benefit obligation in order to estimate the total cost of our obligation to provide medical benefits  we must make a judgment about the rate of inflation in medical costs 
as our estimate of the rate of inflation of medical costs increases  our calculation of the total cost of providing these benefits increases 
we have assumed that health care costs would increase by in and that this rate of increase would decrease by per year to per year in and beyond 
if the rate of inflation in medical costs were higher per year  we estimate that our total obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits would increase by million 
one of the estimates we have made relates to the implementation of the medicare reform act 
as provided for under that act  we recognized a benefit to our anticipated future prescription drug costs for retirees and their dependents in based on a coordinated implementation of the medicare reform act and our existing benefit programs  including the umwa plan 
in  the government issued regulations which made the subsidy approach the only practical alternative given our existing programs 
in october  we adopted the subsidy approach for and we will continue using the subsidy approach for the subsidy approach will limit our annual benefit to to a maximum of  participant of actual costs 
we expect to incur lower cash payments for workers compensation benefits in than in and expect that amount to decline over time 
we anticipate that these payments will decline because we are no longer self insured for workers compensation benefits and have had no new claimants since we do not pay pension or black lung benefits directly 
these benefits are paid from trusts that we established and funded 
as of december   our pension trusts were underfunded  and we expect to contribute approximately million to these trusts in as of december   our black lung trust was overfunded by million  and during we expect to withdraw approximately million of this surplus from this trust 
asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and the reclamation of land upon cessation of mining 
we account for reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
asset retirement obligations or sfas no 
this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which we incur that obligation 
we capitalize the present value of our estimated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 

table of contents certain of the company s customers have either agreed to reimburse the company for reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
these funds will serve as sources for use in final reclamation activities 
the liability asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet represents our estimate of the present value of the cost of closing our mines and reclaiming land disturbed by mining 
this liability increases as land is mined and decreases as reclamation work is performed and cash expended 
the asset  property  plant and equipment capitalized asset retirement costs  remains constant until new liabilities are incurred or old liabilities are re estimated 
we estimate the future costs of reclamation using standards for mine reclamation that have been established by the government agencies that regulate our operations as well as our own experience in performing reclamation activities 
these estimates can and do change 
developments in our mining program also affect this estimate by influencing the timing of reclamation expenditures 
we amortize our development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs  and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for current information about these obligations  costs and reserve estimates 
deferred income taxes as of december   we have significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses nols  alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we have reduced our deferred income tax assets by a full valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is primarily an estimate of the deferred tax assets that will more likely than not expire before they can be realized in the future by our current operations existing as of december  these estimates and judgments are reviewed annually and also when new  material events  such as an acquisition  take place within the company 
the company believes it will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by its mining operations 
as a result  the company has determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of its regular federal net operating loss carryforwards  since they are not available to reduce amt income in the future 
the company has also determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all its amt credit carryforwards  since they are only available to offset future regular income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has determined that since its net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and the company is unable to forecast that it will have taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets 
the company has also therefore recorded a full valuation allowance for its state net operating losses  since it believes that it is not more likely than not that they will be realized 
amt nols reduce our current income tax expense each year until the amt nols have been fully used 
at december   we had fully used all of our amt nols 
the amt credits that we accumulate do not expire 
however  their value has not been recognized  and will not be recognized  until we can forecast paying regular income taxes and are therefore able to use the credits 
this will not occur until all of our regular nols are used or expire and our regular income tax exceeds our amt 
in august the energy policy act of was enacted 
among other provisions  it contains a tax credit for the production of coal owned by indian tribes 
the credit is per ton beginning through 
table of contents and per ton from through  with both amounts escalating for inflation 
the credit may be used against regular corporate income tax for all years and against amt for the initial period 
the company s owned absaloka mine  which produces coal under a lease with the crow tribe  produces about million tons per year 
the savings are expected to be shared with the crow tribe when they are realized 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the amounts below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period after total in thousands of dollars westmoreland mining term debt rova term debt rova acquisition debt other debt interest on debt operating leases workers compensation combined benefit fund multiemployer plan postretirement medical benefits qualified pension benefits serp benefits black lung benefits reclamation costs rova coal supply agreement at december   westmoreland mining had deposited million in two restricted accounts as collateral against these obligations 
at december   rova had deposited million in a restricted debt account as collateral against these obligations 
in calculating the amount of interest on debt  we have assumed that the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt would not increase or decrease from the rates in effect at december  we have not accrued the present value of this obligation  because this plan is a multiemployer plan 
we expense our premium payments when due 
the table presents our estimate of our discounted benefit obligation 
the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
the obligations shown above are our expected contributions to the plan assets 
the table presents our estimate of our discounted benefit obligations 
the table presents our estimate of the undiscounted cost for final reclamation 
the accrued liability of million as of december  will increase in present value as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability does not consider the contractual obligations at december   of our customers and of washington group  the contract miner at the absaloka mine to perform reclamation 
effective march   wri acquired the contract to mine the absaloka mine  and assumed the final reclamation obligation 
we estimate that the present value of washington group s receivable that we assumed is 
table of contents million  and the receivables of our other customers total million 
the accrued liability also does not reflect million held in escrow as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of the rosebud mine  or million in restricted cash for reclamation of other mines 
in addition  the absaloka contract mine operator is funding a separate reclamation escrow account which has a balance of approximately million as of december  we estimate that the present value of our net obligation for final reclamation of our mines that is  the costs of final reclamation that are not the contractual responsibilities of others is million at december  responsibility for these amounts may change in certain circumstances 
for example  at the jewett mine  if there is a cessation of mining the customer assumes responsibility for all reclamation 
at december   if there had been a cessation of mining  the customer would have assumed responsibility for approximately million on a present value basis of the reclamation obligation that is currently the responsibility of the company 
rova has two coal supply agreements with teco coal corporation 
the amounts shown in this row assume that rova continues to purchase coal under these contracts at the current volume and does not extend these contracts and that the price per ton payable under these contracts does not increase 
financial implications of the rova acquisition in june  we acquired the interest in rova that we did not previously own 
as part of that transaction  we also acquired five contracts from lg e power services 
pursuant to these contracts two new subsidiaries of the company  westmoreland power operations and westmoreland utility operations  will now operate rova and four other power plants 
rova sells electric power under two power sales agreements  one that expires in and one that expires in capacity charges are calculated based on a rate for each mw hour of electricity produced 
the rova i per mw hour capacity charge is fixed from through and then steps down to a new lower rate in may through the end of the power sales agreement in the rova ii per mw hour capacity charge is fixed from through and then steps down to a new lower rate in june through the end of the power sales agreement in rova s indebtedness was structured so that rova s principal and interest payments are relatively higher through and relatively lower thereafter 
rova s power sales agreements are structured to provide rova sufficient cash to repay its lenders and thus the capacity charges are relatively higher through and relatively lower thereafter 
rova s historical accounting policy for revenue recognition of these capacity charges has been to record them as revenue as amounts were invoiced pursuant to the provisions of the power sales agreements 
as discussed below  revenue recognition rules now require the company to record these capacity charges ratably over the remaining term of the power sales agreements  irrespective of when the amounts are billed and collected 
this change  while having no effect on cash flow or total revenue recognized over the remaining term of the power sales agreements  will have a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of revenue and income at rova 
these two power sales agreements were entered into prior to the effective date of emerging issues task force eitf  revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts and eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 
accordingly  rova s power sales agreements were not subject to the accounting requirements of these pronouncements 
the completion of the rova acquisition triggered the two power sales agreements to be within the scope of eitf under eitf  each of the power sales agreements is considered to contain a lease within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
each such lease is classified as an operating lease 
as a result  we must recognize revenue for future capacity charges ratably over the remaining term of the power sales agreements 
in our historical financial statements  earnings from our original interest in rova appeared as independent power projects equity in earnings because rova was an equity method affiliate 
because we now own of rova  it is now fully consolidated in our financial statements 
the pro forma impact of our ownership of of rova is shown in our form k a filed with the securities and exchange commission on november  on a pro forma basis  if the rova transaction had occurred on january   the 
table of contents net loss attributable to common stockholders for would have increased to approximately million compared to the net loss reported in the historical financial statements of million 
if the rova transaction had occurred on january   the net loss applicable to common shareholders for would have been million 
the pro forma financial statements included in the form k a include pro forma adjustments to reflect the recognition of capacity charges under the power sales agreements ratably over the term of the agreements  adjustments to reflect interest expense on debt incurred to finance the acquisition  and adjustments to reflect depreciation and amortization on the adjusted basis in the asset and liabilities acquired 
for more information  please see our form k a 
substantial debt was incurred to finance rova s development 
westmoreland partners  which owns rova  is required to make principal payments on its indebtedness of million in  million in  million in  million in  and million from through  when rova s project debt is completely repaid 
we incurred million of indebtedness to fund the rova acquisition 
for more information about this indebtedness  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
our cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables  plant and equipment  and intangible assets also increased significantly as a result of the rova acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements includes a paragraph discussing uncertainty regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might reflect such uncertainty 
the major factors impacting our liquidity are payments due on the term loan we entered into to acquire various operations and assets from montana power and knife river in may   payments due on the acquisition debt associated with our purchase of the rova interest  payments due for the buyout of the washington group international mining contract at wri  and additional capital expenditures we plan to make when we take responsibility for operating the mine  cash collateral requirements for additional reclamation bonds in new mining areas  and payments for our heritage health benefit costs 
see factors affecting our liquidity 
unforeseen changes in our ongoing business requirements could also impact our liquidity 
our principal sources of cash flow at westmoreland coal company are dividends from wri  distributions from rova and from westmoreland mining subject to the provisions in their respective debt agreements and dividends from the subsidiaries that operate power plants 
while we believe that the company currently has sufficient capital resources and committed financing arrangements to provide us with adequate liquidity through early  the variability inherent in our mining and power operations and the variability of payments under our postretirement medical plans may adversely impact our actual cash requirements and cash flows 
we do not believe we have capital resources or committed financing arrangements in place to provide adequate liquidity to meet currently projected cash requirements beginning in early based on our most recent forecast 
we are considering several alternatives for raising additional capital during one of the alternatives available to us is to repay the million bridge loan used to acquire rova with proceeds from an equity offering 
repaying this bridge loan would provide us access to the anticipated semi annual cash distributions from rova which are currently required to be applied to the principal and interest payments on the million bridge loan 
if we are unable to repay or refinance the bridge loan  we have the option to extend the term of that loan to four years 
if we elect to extend the loan beyond its initial one year term  the company will be required to issue warrants to the lender to purchase  shares of our common stock at a premium of to the then current stock price 
these warrants would be exercisable for a three year period from the date of issuance 
if the term of the loan is extended  all cash distributions from rova would continue to be required to be applied to the principal and interest payments on the loan through its term 

table of contents we are also considering a common stock rights offering to allow our shareholders the opportunity to make an additional investment in the company 
there can be no assurance that a common stock rights offering can be completed on a timely basis  or at all 
we believe that one of the other alternatives available to us is the sale of one or more of the company s assets 
there can be no assurance that any sale could be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
other capital raising options may be available to us such as a private placement of equity  although we can not be assured that pursuing such an option will be successful 
while no assurance can be given that any of these alternatives can be successfully implemented  management believes that sufficient capital can be raised to meet the company s liquidity requirements 
factors affecting our liquidity our heritage health benefit costs consist primarily of payments for post retirement medical and workers compensation benefits 
we are also obligated for employee pension and pneumoconiosis benefits 
it is important to note that retiree health benefit costs are directly affected by increases in medical service  prescription drug costs and mortality rates 
the most recent actuarial valuations of our heritage health benefits obligations  which pertain primarily to former employees who worked in our eastern mines and are guaranteed life time benefits under the federal coal act  indicated that our heritage health benefit payments would increase annually through and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
in  we paid million for postretirement benefit expenses  million for cbf premiums and million for workers compensation benefits and received million in offsetting medicare d subsidies 
in  we expect to pay million in cash costs for postretirement medical benefits and receive million of offsetting federal subsidies 
in  we expect to make payments for combined benefit fund premiums in the amount of million and million of payments for workers compensation benefits 
the westmoreland mining acquisitions in greatly increased revenues and operating cash flow 
the financing obtained to make those acquisitions requires quarterly interest and principal payments of approximately million 
this debt financing also requires that of excess cash flow  as defined  be set aside to fund the million debt payment due in december therefore  only of westmoreland mining s excess cash flow is available to the company until this debt is paid off in westmoreland mining also entered into the add on debt facility in which requires the use of approximately million of cash each quarter for debt service 
the add on facility permitted westmoreland mining to undertake significant capital projects  principally at the rosebud and jewett mines  without adversely affecting cash available to westmoreland coal company 
the terms of the add on facility permitted westmoreland mining to distribute this million to westmoreland coal company 
westmoreland mining s distributions of million in and million in represented the remainder available from the million add on facility 
in june  we acquired the interest in rova that we did not previously own  which increased revenues and operating cash flow 
this acquisition was funded with million in debt as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
rova also has project level debt which funded the original development of the power plants 
the project level debt requires semi annual principal payments as described in note to the financial statements as well as ongoing interest payments 
the acquisition debt requires approximately million of interest payments each quarter 
should we elect to extend million of the debt term to four years  we will make semi annual principal payments of approximately million  which would amount to substantially all of the cash distributions generated by rova over that term 
on march   we entered into an agreement to acquire wgi s contract to be the exclusive miner at our absaloka mine for approximately million plus assumption of the reclamation obligation 
while certain equipment was included in our purchase  we expect we will need additional capital for investment in mine development projects  mining equipment and to support bonding requirements 
our ongoing and future business needs may also affect liquidity 
we do not anticipate that either our coal or our power production revenues will diminish materially as a result of any future downturn in economic 
table of contents conditions because rova and the power plants that purchase our coal produce relatively low cost  baseload power 
in addition  most of our coal and power production are sold under long term contracts  which help insulate us from unfavorable market developments 
however  contract price reopeners  contract expirations or terminations  and market competition could affect future coal revenues 
we may also need additional capital to support our ongoing efforts to develop new projects such as the gascoyne mine and power facility 
cash balances and line of credit consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million including million at rova  million at westmoreland power inc  million at westmoreland mining  million at wri and million at our captive insurance subsidiary 
the cash at westmoreland mining is available to the company through quarterly distributions  as described below 
the cash at our captive insurance subsidiary and wri is available to the company through dividends 
the cash at rova is available to the company through distributions after debt service and debt reserve account requirements are met 
under the provisions of the rova acquisition bridge loan  all cash distributions from rova subsequent to december   are to be applied to the principal balance of the loan and related interest 
as of december   westmoreland coal company had million of its million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
restricted cash we had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of million at december  compared to million at december  the restricted cash at december  included million in rova s debt service accounts and prepayment accounts and million in westmoreland mining s debt service reserve  long term prepayment  and reclamation escrow accounts 
at december  our reclamation  workers compensation and postretirement medical cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of million  million of which amounts we have classified as non current assets and million of which amounts we have classified as current assets 
in addition  we had accumulated reclamation deposits of million at december   representing cash received from customers of the rosebud mine to pay for reclamation  plus interest earned on the investments 
preferred stock during  we exchanged a total of  depositary shares at an exchange ratio of shares of common stock for each depositary share  compared to the conversion ratio of provided for under the terms of the certificate of designation governing the preferred stock 
as a result of these preferred stock exchanges  million of premium on the exchange of preferred stock for common stock was recorded in  as an increase in net loss applicable to common shareholders 
this premium on the exchange of preferred stock for common stock represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred to the preferred stock holders over the value of consideration that would have been exchanged under the original conversion terms 
while we can redeem preferred shares for cash at any time for the redemption value of plus accumulated dividends  we agreed to these negotiated exchanges as a cash conservation measure and because they reduced the number of outstanding depositary shares  thereby eliminating million of accumulated dividends and associated future dividend requirements 
westmoreland mining debt facilities the original term loan agreement  which financed our acquisition of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  continues to restrict westmoreland mining s ability to make distributions to westmoreland coal company 
until westmoreland mining has fully paid the original acquisition debt  which is scheduled for december   westmoreland mining may only pay westmoreland coal company a management fee and distribute to westmoreland coal company of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow 
westmoreland mining is depositing the remaining into an account that will be applied to the million balloon payment 
table of contents due december  in when westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility  it also extended its revolving credit facility to and reduced the amount of the facility to million 
in december  westmoreland mining amended the revolving facility to increase the borrowing base to million and to extend its maturity to april to better align with its operating needs 
the increase includes the ability to issue letters of credit up to million which westmoreland mining expects to use for reclamation bond collateral requirements 
as of december   a letter of credit for million was supported by westmoreland mining s revolving credit facility 
westmoreland mining had borrowed million against the facility and million was available to borrow as of that date 
historical sources and uses of cash cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million for the increase in net loss in reduced cash provided by operating activities by million  which was offset by million of increases in non cash charges to income 
cash provided by operating activities includes million invoiced under our power sales agreements  which has been recorded as deferred revenue 
cash distributions from independent power projects decreased million in  primarily because our rova distributions received after the acquisition were eliminated in consolidation 
unscheduled maintenance outages at rova during late also decreased cash distributions from independent power projects in changes in working capital increased cash provided by operating activities in by million compared to an increase in cash provided from changes in working capital of million in cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million for cash provided by operating activities increased in due to a decrease in the net loss of million  an increase in net non cash charges to income of million  and an increase in cash distributions from independent power projects of million 
changes in working capital increased cash provided by operating activities in by million  compared to an increase of million in our working capital deficit was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in our working capital deficit resulted primarily from the million short term rova bridge financing  the consolidation of rova which had million of negative working capital  and the elimination of million in deferred overburden removal costs as the result of a change in accounting principle discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this accounting change had no effect on cash flows 
our working capital deficit was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in our working capital deficit resulted primarily from a million increase in the current portion of our asset retirement obligation and an million increase in trade accounts payable 
we used million of cash in investing activities in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by our million investment for our rova acquisition net of cash acquired 
cash provided by investing activities in included million received from the sale of mineral interests 
cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment for mine development and equipment and investment in a company wide software system 
cash flows from investing activities in also included a million increase in our restricted cash accounts  pursuant to westmoreland mining s term loan agreement and as collateral for our surety bonds 
additions to property  mine equipment  development projects and investment in a new company wide software system were million in increases in restricted cash accounts  bond collateral  and reclamation deposits were million in we used million of cash in investing activities in compared to million in the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our restricted cash of million 
cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment for mine equipment and investment in a company wide software system 

table of contents we received million of cash from our financing activities in this increase was primarily a result of million of borrowings to finance the rova acquisition and was offset by the repayment of million of long term debt 
cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily the result of million in borrowings under our long term debt and revolving lines of credit offset by million used for the repayment of long term debt 
in march  westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility 
this facility made million available to us in the add on facility permitted westmoreland mining to undertake significant capital projects  principally at the rosebud and jewett mines  without adversely affecting cash available to westmoreland coal company 
the terms of the add on facility permitted westmoreland mining to distribute this million to westmoreland coal company 
westmoreland mining s distributions of million in and million in represented the remainder available from the million add on facility 
operational and capital expenditure outlook we anticipate that the following events and developments will affect our liquidity and earnings 
tons sold in are expected to increase by approximately compared to tons sold in coal margins are expected to increase reflecting higher prices from customer contract renewals offset in part by increases in the costs of operating the mines 
we will receive a reserve dedication payment of million from a customer in early we anticipate that capital expenditures and new investments related to our mining activities will increase in from as a result of the replacement of operational equipment at our mines 
as a result  we expect higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
in february  the company sold its interest in a coal royalty for million and will recognize a million gain on the sale in the first quarter 
we anticipate a reduction in our heritage health benefit expenses as a result of lower health care costs  combined benefit fund premiums  workers compensation costs as well as the million and additional interest refund expected from the cbf 
results will reflect the consolidation of the operating results of rova for a full year compared to only six months in pricing outlook pricing for about of our sales tons expired on december  and were renewed effective january  at a price increase 
contracts covering about excluding the nrg contract at the jewett mine as described in the paragraph below of our expected sales tonnage are scheduled to expire on december   with anticipated renewals and repricing effective january  contracts covering approximately of the tons that we expect to sell in are scheduled to expire in however  the customers under these contracts have the option to renew them 
we expect that these options will be exercised 
as a result  we expect that less than of our expected sales tonnage will be repriced effective january  contracts covering approximately of the company s expected sales tonnage are scheduled to expire on december  and are anticipated to be renewed and repriced on january  sales from the jewett mine to nrg texas limestone station account for approximately of our sales volume and are subject to annual price redeterminations from january  through contract expiration in we segregate these sales from our other repricing opportunities because the contract provides for a complex set of calculations and other provisions  rights  and obligations that may distort the effect that the market has on price outcomes 
texas westmoreland and nrg texas are currently discussing various alternatives for determination of pricing effective january  forward 
one of those alternatives could be adherence to the existing contract under which the price for has been determined in arbitration to be per million btu 
in  we received a price of per million btu 
additionally  in  the 
table of contents customer agreed to fund most capital expenditures at the jewett mine

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells commodities principally coal and electric power and also purchases commodities principally diesel fuel  steel and electricity 
the company produces and sells coal through its subsidiaries  wri  westmoreland mining llc  and westmoreland coal sales co  and the company produces and sells electricity and steam through its subsidiary westmoreland energy llc 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts reduce the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices 
these contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators  such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices  such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
contracts may also contain periodic price reopeners or renewal provisions  which give us the opportunity to adjust the price of our coal to reflect developments in the marketplace 
during  the company entered into three derivative contracts to manage a portion of its exposure to price volatility of diesel fuel used in its operations 
in a typical commodity swap agreement  the company receives the difference between a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is greater than the fixed price 
if the index price is lower  the company pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  the company effectively fixes the price it will pay in the future for the quantity of diesel fuel subject to the swap agreement 
the first two contracts covered approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  which represented an estimated two thirds of the annual consumption at one of our mines  at a weighted average fixed price of per gallon 
these contracts settled monthly from february to december  during  the company fully settled these contracts  which resulted in a loss of approximately million 
in october the company entered into a derivative contract to manage a portion of its exposure to the price volatility of diesel fuel to be used in its operations in the contract covers million gallons of diesel fuel at a weighted average fixed price of per gallon 
this contract settles monthly from january to december  the company accounts for this derivative instrument on a mark to market basis through earnings 
the consolidated financial statements as of december  reflect unrealized losses on this contract of million  which is recorded in accounts payable and as cost of sales coal 
in january  the company entered into an additional derivative contract to manage a portion of its exposure to the price volatility of diesel fuel to be used in its operations in the contract covers million gallons of diesel fuel at a weighted average fixed price of per gallon 
this contract settles monthly from february to december  
table of contents interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
the company s revolving lines of credit have a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
based on balances outstanding on the lines of credit as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase or decrease interest expense by  on an annual basis 
westmoreland mining s series d notes under its term loan agreement have a variable interest rate based on libor 
a one percent change in libor would increase or decrease interest expense on the series d notes by  on an annual basis 
a portion of rova s project debt under its credit agreement also has a variable interest rate based on libor 
a one percent change in libor would increase or decrease interest expense on rova s debt by million on an annual basis 
the company s rova acquisition debt also has variable interest rates based on libor 
a one percent change in libor would increase or decrease interest expense on the acquisition term loan by approximately million on an annual basis 
the rosebud mine has capital leases with variable interest rates 
a one percent change in the interest rates for these leases would increase or decrease interest expenses by less than million on an annual basis 
the carrying value and estimated fair value of the company s long term debt with fixed interest rates at december  were million and million  respectively 
the company s heritage health benefit expenses are also impacted by interest rate changes because its workers compensation  pension  pneumoconiosis  and postretirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
