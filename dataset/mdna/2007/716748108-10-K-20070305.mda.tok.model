item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company  which from the commencement of operations in through  was focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties in texas and oklahoma 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
specific asset diversification activities included the acquisition of proved reserves and acreage in the southeast carthage field in east texas 
in  we entered the arkoma basin in oklahoma by building an acreage position  drilling wells and acquiring proved reserves 
during we further increased our presence in oklahoma through multiple acquisition transactions and an expanded drilling program 
our diversification efforts continued during through the opening of an exploration office in tulsa  oklahoma to augment our increased presence in the region  drilling of gross wells in oklahoma and east texas  which represented approximately of our total gross wells drilled during  and divestiture of certain mature gulf of mexico properties 
through these efforts  at december   of our estimated proved reserves were located in longer life basins as compared to at december  and at december  during  of our production was derived from longer life basins versus during  during and virtually none in the decline in production from longer life basins as a percent of our total production during was primarily due to the restoration of production at main pass block in january and our discovery at the turtle bayou field  onshore louisiana 
our main pass block field had been shut in since september as a result of damages sustained during hurricane ivan 
for the second consecutive year we were successful in achieving annual company records for production  estimated proved reserves  cash flow from operating activities and net income 
during  we increased these operational and financial metrics by   and  respectively  from the previous record levels achieved during our record results over the last two years reflect our success in leveraging strong commodity prices to accelerate the evaluation of our prospect inventory in the gulf coast basin and increase our penetration into longer life basins through significantly increased drilling activity and selective acquisitions 
the growth in our estimated proved reserves during was offset in part by our record production and the sale of bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
during  we invested approximately million in exploratory  development and acquisition activities as we drilled a company record gross wells realizing an overall success rate of on our drilling program 
this drilling activity represented a increase in the number of gross wells drilled during over the past two years we have drilled gross wells with a success rate 
this compares to gross wells drilled during the five year period through critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
declines in prices or reserves could result in a future write down of oil and gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute quantities that we are reasonably certain of recovering in future years 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the expected event does not occur  or the hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded on the income statement 
our hedges are specifically referenced to the nymex index prices we receive for our designated production 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex index prices and the posted prices we receive from the designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counterparties to those contracts 
because the counterparties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a market value by providing us with a price at which they would be willing to settle such contracts as of the given date 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the effective date for adoption is the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  accordingly  we adopted the standard during the first quarter of sfas r permits adoption using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date using the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards at the effective date related to awards granted prior to the effective date 
an alternate method  the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to retroactively adjust  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
during  we recognized million of share based compensation expense 
this non cash expense is reflected as a component of our general and administrative expense 
the impact to net income of adopting sfas r during was million  or approximately per basic and diluted share 
at december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to granted  but unvested restricted stock and stock options 
this expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of years from december  see note to our financial statements for more detailed information relative to share based compensation 
we previously accounted for our share based compensation plans under the principles prescribed by apb opinion no 
accordingly  no share based compensation cost is reflected in net income prior to january   as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
see note for disclosure of share based compensation cost prior to january  reflected on a pro forma basis as prior period financial statements have not been restated 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and accounting for income taxes and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin will become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that fin will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
year ended december  production oil bbls gas mcfe total production mcfe sales total oil sales total gas sales total oil and gas sales average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcfe per mcfe the above sales and average sales prices include increases reductions to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   and  and oil hedges of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the results were attributable to the following components production oil production during totaled  barrels  a increase from  while natural gas production increased to bcfe from gas production of bcfe 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
contributing to the increase in production during was the restoration of production at our main pass field in january and production attributable to the drilling success rates we achieved during each of and production from main pass accounted for of our total production for production gains during were offset by the shut in of the majority of production at our ship shoal block field during october and november due to work on the main field pipeline and the sale of certain mature gulf of mexico properties in november production from ship shoal block accounted for approximately of our total production during the nine months ended september  production during the third and fourth quarters of was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during  of our total production was natural gas as compared to during this shift towards natural gas is primarily the result of our expanded operations in texas and oklahoma where the production is primarily natural gas 
also contributing to the increase in gas as a percent of total production was the shut in of ship shoal discussed above 
ship shoal  which was brought back on line in december  produces substantial oil volumes which we expect will have the effect of reducing gas as a percentage of total production during based on our drilling success during and assuming we are able to maintain our historically high drilling success rates with our drilling program success rate over the last five years on gross wells drilled  we expect that our production will continue to increase during  as compared to s production 
prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were essentially flat as compared to the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  from  during as a result of increased production volumes 
assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we expect that our revenues would continue to increase as we expect to grow our production during through drilling and strategic acquisitions of producing properties 
during  gas gathering revenue and other income totaled  as compared to  during the increase in  as compared to  is the result of increased gas volumes being transported through the gas gathering systems  as well as a full year of operations  as the majority of our gas gathering assets were acquired in connection with certain purchases of oil and gas properties during mid expenses lease operating expenses during increased to  as compared to  during however  on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe in  only a increase from the per mcfe of operating costs in operating costs during were higher than in due to the increases in costs for oil field related services prevalent throughout the industry  such as labor  transportation  insurance and materials 
assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we would expect lease operating expenses during to approximate at december   we had a million receivable representing costs incurred to repair hurricane related damages that we believe qualify for reimbursement under our insurance policies 
since filing our claim in late  we have received a total of million in reimbursements 
production taxes increased to  during from  during the increase in production taxes is primarily due to significantly increased production from our oklahoma  texas and onshore louisiana properties  as well as a increase in the louisiana severance tax rate effective july  in addition  main pass  which is located in louisiana state waters and is thus subject to production taxes  was brought back on line in january gas gathering costs during totaled  because the majority of our gas gathering assets were acquired in connection with purchases of certain oil and gas properties in mid  gas gathering costs during only totaled  general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
included in general and administrative expenses was  attributable to share based compensation recognized in connection with the adoption of sfas r on january  excluding the impact of the adoption of sfas r  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increase in our staffing level during in order to accommodate our increased operational activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in the increase in dd a expense is the result of the growth in our oil and gas properties over the last two years from our significantly expanded drilling activity and several property acquisitions during on an mcfe basis  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the increase in our dd a expense per mcfe is primarily due to increased costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves and the impact of four unsuccessful wells drilled in the gulf coast basin during assuming commodity prices remain at current levels  we would expect the costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves to generally approximate levels 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated assets  totaled  during versus  during included in interest expense during was a charge of  primarily related to previously deferred financing costs  which were written off in connection with the repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 
the increase in interest expense  as compared to  is primarily due to the impact of a full year of interest on our senior notes due the notes during  which were issued during the second quarter of we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  during the increase is primarily due to the higher operating profit during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the results were attributable to the following components production oil production in totaled  barrels  a decline from  while natural gas production increased to bcf from gas production of bcf 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
during  of our total production was natural gas as compared to during this shift towards natural gas is the result of our expanded operations in texas and oklahoma where the production is primarily natural gas 
the growth in production during was primarily the result of our increased capital expenditures  which included several acquisitions of producing properties and a increase in the number of gross wells drilled  as compared to offsetting our production gains were the shut in of a portion of our gulf coast basin fields during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita and the shut in of our main pass field throughout due to third party pipeline damage from hurricane ivan in production from main pass was restored in january prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  from  during as a result of higher commodity prices and increased production volumes 
during  gas gathering revenue and other income totaled  as compared to  during the increase in is primarily due to income generated by our gas gathering assets acquired during and interest income earned on cash proceeds from the notes 
expenses lease operating expenses during increased to  as compared to  during on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe in  a increase from the per mcfe of operating expenses in at december   we owned working interests in gross wells  as compared to gross wells at december  operating costs during were higher due to this significant increase in the number of producing wells in which we participate  as well as the increases in costs for oil field related services prevalent throughout the industry  such as labor  transportation  insurance and materials 
production taxes increased to  during from  during production taxes in texas and oklahoma are predominately value based and therefore fluctuate in relation to commodity prices 
as a result  the increase in production taxes is primarily due to higher commodity prices coupled with increased production from our oklahoma and onshore texas properties 
additionally  effective july   there was an increase to the louisiana gas severance tax rate that contributed to the increase in production taxes 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increase in our staffing level during in order to accommodate our increased operational activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in on an mcfe basis  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the increase in our dd a expense per mcfe is primarily due to increased costs to drill for  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated assets  totaled  during versus  during the increase in interest expense is the result of the higher debt level and interest rate associated with the notes  as well as a charge during of  related to previously deferred financing costs  primarily associated with our subordinated debt credit facility  which were written off 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is primarily due to the higher operating profit during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of common stock and debt securities and sales of properties 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations increased from  during to  in the increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to our growth in production during at december   we had a working capital deficit of  versus a deficit of  at december  the improvement in our working capital balance was primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments  which is the result of lower estimated future commodity prices and the expiration of several hedge contracts 
we believe that our working capital balance should be viewed in conjunction with availability of borrowings under our bank credit facility when measuring liquidity 
at december   we had million of available capacity under our bank credit facility 
source of capital debt during the second quarter of  we issued the notes  which have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on may and november at december   million had been accrued in connection with the may  interest payment 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the notes 
on november   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  petroquest energy  llc  entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which was amended in december  provides for a million revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow amounts based on the available borrowing base as determined in the credit facility 
the credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit and matures on november  the credit facility is secured by  among other things  a lien on at least of the pdp present value and at least of the aggregate proved reserves of our oil and gas properties 
pdp present value means the present value discounted at nine percent of the future net revenues attributable to producing reserves 
the borrowing base under the credit facility is currently million 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants therein 
outstanding balances on the credit facility bear interest at either the alternate base rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to based on borrowing base usage or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the alternate base rate is equal to the higher of the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  and the eurodollar rate is equal to the applicable british bankers association libor rate for deposits in us dollars 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility  including a maximum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to annualized consolidated ebitda  determined on a rolling four quarter basis of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility also includes customary restrictions with respect to liens  indebtedness  loans and investments  material changes in our business  asset sales or leases or transfers of assets  restricted payments such as distributions and dividends  mergers or consolidations  transactions with affiliates and rate management transactions 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  other than under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 
source of capital issuance of securities we have an effective million universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants from time to time or when financing needs arise 
the registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continually evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects or in projects that have longer estimated lives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our assets 
during november  we closed the sale of our interests in mature gulf of mexico fields for approximately million  subject to customary post closing adjustments  plus certain future consideration to be received upon the settlement of insurance claims 
in addition to the cash proceeds received  we were relieved of approximately million of estimated discounted future abandonment obligations relative to these properties 
the table below outlines the production  revenues  production taxes and lease operating expenses attributable to our interest in the properties that were divested 
because the majority of the properties sold were acquired during  the impact on results is minimal 
certain expenses not directly attributable to these properties such as general and administrative expense  interest expense and depreciation expense  were not presented due to the difficulty in allocating such costs to the particular properties 
years ended december  production mcfe percentage of total company production oil and gas revenues production taxes lease operating expenses revenues net of direct operating expenses use of capital exploration and development we have an exploration and development program budget for that will require significant capital 
our capital budget for is expected to range from million to million 
based on our outlook of commodity prices and estimated production  we believe that cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional borrowings from banks or other lenders  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
we do not explicitly budget for acquisitions  however  we spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
depending on the size of the acquisition  we would expect to finance the transaction using our bank credit facility or  if necessary  additional equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you that such financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total bank debt senior notes purchase obligations operating leases capital projects total includes principal and estimated interest 
consists of commitments for the rental of drilling rigs and seismic data acquisition obligations 
consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for equipment rentals 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our leased properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received from the counterparties to our derivative instruments approximately million in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
as of december   we had entered into the following oil and gas hedge contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas costless collar  mmbtu crude oil january june costless collar bbls july december costless collar bbls at december   we recognized an asset of approximately million related to the estimated fair value of these derivative instruments 
based on estimated future commodity prices as of december   we would realize a million gain  net of taxes  as an addition to oil and gas sales during the next months 
these gains are expected to be reclassified based on the schedule of oil and gas volumes stipulated in the derivative contracts
